Basic Income is an economic system that guarantees a minimum wage to all citizens, regardless of employment status. It is a form of social security that provides a secure, unconditional income in regular payments to everyone, allowing them to meet their basic needs for food, housing, and other essentials. This system works to prevent poverty and to provide a greater level of autonomy and freedom for citizens, allowing them to focus on their passions and pursue higher levels of education and skill development. Basic Income is a form of economic justice that provides equal opportunity to all.
