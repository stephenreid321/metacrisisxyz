A smart contract is a digital agreement that is self-enforcing and self-executing between two or more parties, facilitated by a network of associated nodes that validate and enforce compliance with the contract’s terms. Using consensus protocols and technologies, smart contracts can enable secure automated trustless exchanges between parties to facilitate the transfer of monetary value or any form of digitally-validated asset. Smart contract technology presents a specialized form of automated digital contracts that can serve to streamline the execution, reconciliation, and enforcement of complex agreements, reduce the costs associated with manual contract processing, and further autonomous autonomous decision processes.
