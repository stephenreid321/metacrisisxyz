Base reality is the primary state in which an individual exists, and is an understanding of the underlying truth of their experience. It is the perception of reality that shapes their interpretation of their environment, the meaning making of their experience, the relationships with others, what is even possible, and the way they choose to engage with their world. It consists of beliefs, behaviors, and environmental influences which are immediate, and in the present moment, and holds the power to determine the direction of the individual's life.
