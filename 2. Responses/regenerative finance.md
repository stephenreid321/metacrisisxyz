Regenerative finance is a paradigm shift in economic practice. It emphasizes the notion of preserving and restoring capital, instead of merely extracting value and moving on. Drawing on innovations like environmental bonds, ecological tax reform, and microfinance initiatives, regenerative finance works to create a more equitable, resilient and sustainable future by redirecting capital to those areas and initiatives that will improve air, soil, water, habitat, economic and social well-being. It is based on universally accepted principles, including social and environmental justice, economic and ecological viability, efficiency, transparency, participation in decision-making, and sustainability.
