Demurrage is an economic term that describes the cost incurred from leaving goods idle for a period longer than the required time. This charge is usually applied to goods that are either leased or in the custody of a third-party, such as a port, airport, or railway operator. In essence, demurrage serves to incentivize faster, more efficient usage of physical resources, ensuring a more equitable and efficient use of transportation and storage facilities. This cost can be seen as a penalty for inefficient use of resources, making it important to consider demurrage costs when evaluating the overall costs of a particular supply chain or logistical plan.
