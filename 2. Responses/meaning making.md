Meaning making is the process in which individuals and/or groups interpret and give significance to their various experiences and encounters in their environment, both of which can be tangible and intangible. This is achieved through the utilization of various cognitive and emotional processes, such as attributing meaning and creating narratives, to make sense of their life experiences and shape their sense of identity, understanding, and connections to the world. As a result, meaning making illuminates the ways in which individuals and groups engage in social and discursive constructions of their subjectivity.
