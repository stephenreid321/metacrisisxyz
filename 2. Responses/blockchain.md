A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger, often operating on public networks and utilizing cryptographic techniques, that records and stores the provenance, ownership, and associated metadata of digital assets in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. By not relying on a single trusted source, blockchains help facilitate trust, consensus, and consensus-based decisions among multiple participants. As such, it has become increasingly popular as a technology platform for digital asset exchanges, financial transactions, and other business activities due to its decentralizing, privacy-protecting, and cost-saving properties.
