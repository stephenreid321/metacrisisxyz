A public good is a service or other benefit that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that it is impossible to exclude individuals from benefiting from the goods, while non-rivalrous means that an individual’s consumption of the goods does not reduce the availability of the goods to others. Public goods have the potential to create substantial positive externalities for all members of a society, and thus are of particular interest to economists, social scientists, civil servants, and policy makers. Free riders, or those who benefit from the good without contributing, can undermine the efficiency of provisioning, spurring efforts to mitigate the challenge of collective action.
