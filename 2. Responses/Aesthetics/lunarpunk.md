Lunarpunk is a term that describes approaches to living, technology, and societal organization which emphasize the shifts in consciousness and culture necessary to live sustainably in space, with attention to both planetary terraforming and interstellar journeys. It is a perspective, both in action and idea, that focuses on the exploration and celebration of the possibilities of space, intending to emphasize our shared inter-connectedness and the development of a post-scarcity economy which facilitates better health, welfare, and sustainability between all who live in and beyond the confines of Earth.
