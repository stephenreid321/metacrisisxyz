Mycopunk is an emergent worldview that proposes fungal lifeforms as a solution to many of the ecological and social challenges faced by humankind today. This new meta-perspective on ecological systems pays special attention to the incredible potential of fungi as an agent of environmental transformation and regeneration. Mycopunk is an intentionally optimistic view of the future, envisioning a world in which humans and fungal lifeforms exist in a mutualistic and symbiotic relationship, resulting in heightened ecological sustainability and greater social justice for all.
