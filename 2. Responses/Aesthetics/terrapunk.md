Terrapunk is a term that refers to speculative fiction that is centered around themes related to environmentalism, ecological restoration and the sustainable management of natural resources. It often incorporates elements of post-apocalyptic fiction, drawing upon social criticism to explore the broader implications of how humanity can live in a more harmonious relationship with nature. While terrapunk stories emphasize the need for humanity to live in balance with natural systems, they also showcase the potential of these systems, using a mix of technology, culture and ingenuity to create a positive future. By using innovative and imaginative storytelling techniques, terrapunk fiction can inspire us to imagine a future where environmental degradation is reversible.
