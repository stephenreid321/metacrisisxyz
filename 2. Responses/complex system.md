A complex system is a set of interconnected components, often of different scales, which interact and influence each other in unpredictable ways. This can lead to emergent properties that cannot be predicted solely by the properties of the components, and the system can exhibit nonlinear behaviours in response to internal or external changes. The complexity of a system is dynamic too, often changing over time and depending on the context of the system, making it difficult to determine the cause of change.
