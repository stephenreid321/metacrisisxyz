Sortition is a method of governance in which decision-making is partially allotted through random selection. The purpose of using sortition is to balance out the power dynamics between those in governing roles and those being governed, while also helping to diversify the range of perspectives around decision-making. This practice can be found in certain systems of democracy and historically, with Athenian democracy selecting magistrates through random selection from their citizen body. In modern practice, however, it is most commonly employed by organizations and initiatives as a tool to increase fairness, reduce reliance on charismatic leaders, and increase representation of all stakeholders.
