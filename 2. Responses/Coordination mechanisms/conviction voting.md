Conviction voting is the process of voting with conviction, going beyond casting a ballot on the basis of facts, the impulses of the moment, or a desire to find the way of least resistance. It requires researching, exploring, and making an actual determination, rather than blindly accepting a party platform. It is a type of voting wherein a person weighs the possible implications and consequences of their vote, and is not afraid to stand up for a position they believe in, regardless of varying popular opinion. Ultimately, voting with conviction requires seeing the election through a moral framework, not just a partisan or utilitarian one.
