Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making process in which participants use a fixed budget of tokens to express the importance of a particular issue to them. Each individual’s vote is weighted, such that if they double their vote, the importance conveyed is quadrupled. It is a novel method of aggregating individual preferences across a population of stakeholders and provides a mechanism for shared governance when it is impractical to consensus build with each individual. Quadratic voting operates on the assumption that the collective will take into consideration the interests of each party, thus resulting in an improved “wisdom of the crowd” outcome.
