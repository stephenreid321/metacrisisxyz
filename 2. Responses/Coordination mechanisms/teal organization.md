A Teal Organization is an organizational system, which operates at an archetypal evolutionary level of consciousness. This holistic, evolutionary framing enables an increased ability to respond to complex interpersonal and situational dynamics, allowing for a more adaptive, evolutionary, collective intelligence that is based on self-management and self-organization. Teal organizations are often agile, self-organizing networks where purpose, shared values and vision are seen as essential for collective alignment and strive for self-organizing structures that view all facets of the organization as interconnected and self-regulating.
