Holocracy is a system of self-organization and distributed decision-making that emphasizes collective collaboration and the optimization of group and individual autonomy. It is based on the notion that leadership should be emergent, with teams and individuals taking initiative, and proposing solutions collaboratively. Holocracy is an organizational model that eliminates the traditional hierarchy of management by creating what's known as a 'decision making culture' within the organization. This culture is designed to achieve maximum transparency and efficiency through iterative feedback processes, which ensure that decisions are based on the collective intelligence, creativity, and feedback of the organization.
