A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a computerized system for creating trustless and transparent governance structures for distributed organizations. By utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technology, DAOs are able to create efficient, self-enforcing protocols to encourage the cooperation and collaboration within a decentralized organization in ways that would otherwise be impossible without a centralized entity. The potential of DAOs to remove barriers and drastically reduce transaction costs for decentralized organizations promises to break down many of the barriers and hurdles associated with traditional organizations.
