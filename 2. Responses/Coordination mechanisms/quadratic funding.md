Quadratic funding is a funding model that encourages the proportional distribution of resources and rewards according to the impact of the initiative or project being funded. Capital is distributed to organizations according to the square of the number of estimated beneficiaries, allowing innovators and entrepreneurs to take risks that have greater impact and incentivizing them to reach more people with their initiatives. The model is founded on the underlying principle of proportionally rewarding initiatives commensurate with the size of their potential benefit and potential reach. This can be particularly effective in providing access to resources for those with significant potential to make a good impact but with limited resources.
