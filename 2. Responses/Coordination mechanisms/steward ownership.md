Steward Ownership is a style of corporate governance where those who benefit most from the entity are held accountable to the broader social good. Instead of the traditional shareholder-centric model of maximizing returns for the capital owners, Steward Ownership seeks to combine the interests of all stakeholders, while aligning incentives to ensure the greatest benefit for all. It is a system-level approach designed to ensure equitable participation of all members of a company equivalent to their contributions to its success. This management style requires careful balancing of interests and active involvement of the stewards (owners) in the decision-making process.
