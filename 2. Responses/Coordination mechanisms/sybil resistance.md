Sybil Resistance is a security property of digital systems designed to protect against attacks where a malicious actor creates multiple identities, or "Sybils," in order to gain control of online networks. It employs tactics like verification methods which require authentication, making it difficult for malicious actors to create and maintain multiple identities. Sybil Resistance also utilizes cryptographic techniques such as distributed consensus algorithms and permissioned networks, which add complexity to the process of launching a successful Sybil attack. This allows digital platforms to ensure that all identities are legitimate, enabling them to remain secure from malicious actors who are attempting to game the system or gain illegitimate access.
