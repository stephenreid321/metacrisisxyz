Sociocracy is an organizational structure and methodology that aims to incorporate the principles of openness, participation, collaboration and fairness into decision-making structures and processes. It combines holistic systems thinking, interpersonal dynamics theory, and organizational development theory to create a method of decentralized decision-making that emphasizes the importance of considering the perspectives of all stakeholders when making decisions. This is done through the establishment of circles, with each circle focusing on a different aspect of the organization, and creating systems that allow for the equitable and transparent exchange of information and idea. The aim is to create an organization in which governance, decision-making, and problem-solving are distributed among its members, allowing for greater equity and creativity while avoiding power imbalances.
