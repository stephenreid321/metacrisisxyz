Platform co-ops are organizations owned and democratically managed by members of the platform, such as workers, freelancers, creative professionals, and service providers. Governed by principles of shared ownership, decision-making authority, and equitable distribution of benefits and revenues, platform co-ops incentivize members to work together to create a sustainable and mutually beneficial business model. As a result, platform co-ops are intrinsically community-oriented, offering members a more equitable stake in the operations and long-term profits of the platform. From digital labor to small farmer cooperatives to crowdfunding enterprises, platform co-ops facilitate a more democratic form of the collaborative economy.
