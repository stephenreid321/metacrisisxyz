A Citizen Assembly is a deliberative form of democracy in which a randomly selected group of citizens come together to discuss a specific issue and, using evidence-based group decision-making, arrive at a consensus-based policy recommendation that reflects the will of the people. By engaging people to actively participate in policy formation, instead of merely electing representatives, citizens can be empowered to collaboratively create the future they want for their communities.
