Stigmergy is a type of distributed emergent behavior in which agents that interact indirectly with their environment and with each other are able to produce coordinated behavior without centralized control or direct communication. It is related to self-organization, which occurs within ensembles of decentralized interactions without centralized control. Stigmergy gives rise to adaptive organisms, resulting in emergent complex behavior which can be both cooperative and competitive. This concept is particularly useful for understanding the transformation of a complex physical or virtual system into a self-sustaining structure and enabling efficient and resilient communication networks for distributed systems.
