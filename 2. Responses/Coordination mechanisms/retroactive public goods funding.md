Retroactive public goods funding, as defined by Daniel Schmachtenberger, is an approach to public finance which seeks to ensure that those benefitting from the production of public goods are responsible for funding them. Retroactive public goods funding obligates those who use or consume public goods to pay a fee for their use or consumption at the time the goods are used, rather than being funded from public coffers. This approach captures the otherwise-unmanifested economic value derived from the public goods in questions, while also protecting the public from having to fund the services or goods provided. Consequently, it encourages both the efficient and equitable allocation of resources.
