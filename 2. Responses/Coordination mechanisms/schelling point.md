A Schelling point is a useful concept for understanding the self-organizing dynamics of systemic behavior. It is a point of agreement among complex systems that can emerge without any central coordination. It is the most stable consensus among a system where even if some participants have non-cooperative incentives, they will still converge on the same agreed upon outcome without explicit coordination. This point of agreement represents a solution that is optimal for all participants, even under conditions of incomplete information.
