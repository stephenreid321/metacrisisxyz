A mesh network is a type of wide area network (WAN) in which each node in the network can relays data to other nodes in the network, creating redundant connections between devices. The redundant connections create in effect a "mesh" of interconnected nodes, forming a resilient, self-healing network architecture with the ability to quickly recover from failure or connection disruption without any single node being a point of failure. This type of architecture provides increased data availability, scalability and reliability compared to traditional WANs.
