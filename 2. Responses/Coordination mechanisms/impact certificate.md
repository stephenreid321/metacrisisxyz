An Impact Certificate is a framework for assessing the social and environmental impact of an individual or organization's activities. It is designed to help organizations track, analyze, and report on their impact, and to provide insights into how they can adjust their strategies and practices to reach their goals. It uses measurements and metrics to assess the positive and negative outcomes of an organization's efforts, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative data. By creating a transparent, replicable, and consistent impact assessment process, Impact Certificates can help organizations understand their true impact and make adjustments and improvements over time.
