Futarchy is a form of governance wherein decisions are made based on the combination of predictive markets and collective intelligence. It relies on the use of public markets to estimate expected utility outcomes of decision-making and to aggregate the opinions of stakeholders into a probabilistic, distributive outcome. The use of markets provides a form of liquidity in decision-making, and allows for a decentralized and often less costly alignment of opinion. Further, this type of governance is more adaptive to continuously changing conditions and offers a more transparent form of ‘intelligence’ for all participants.
