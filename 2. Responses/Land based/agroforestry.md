Agroforestry is the intentional integration of tree and shrub species into agricultural systems to form diversified, long-term, multifunctional land management systems. Based on the premise that productive agriculture and forestry practices can be mutually beneficial, agroforestry mixes trees, crops, and animals in various temporal and spatial arrangements to increase biodiversity and provide ecosystem services while helping to manage pests, weeds, and diseases, while also decreasing soil erosion, and enhancing both landscape aesthetics, and resilience to drought, floods, and other natural disturbances.
