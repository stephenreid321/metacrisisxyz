Regenerative agriculture is a holistic, systems-based approach to farming, that focuses on improving the health of soil and surrounding ecosystems, while seeking to produce crops and generate profit in a sustainable and socially-just manner. The goal is to improve overall ecosystem dynamics, resilience and biodiversity, while engaging in effective verifiable carbon sequestration practices and restoring focus on regional agricultural communities in order to protect and enhance regional food systems. This philosophy is founded on holistic management practices that strive to improve natural resource health outcomes and create a holistic, resilient and sustainable agricultural system that generates economic and environmental resilience for both farmers and the broader community.
