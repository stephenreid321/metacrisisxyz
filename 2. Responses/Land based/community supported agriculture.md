Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) involves farming practices wherein members of a specific local community collaborate to outsource food production to a farmer in their region. This involves a financial commitment from both parties, with the community providing an upfront investment for the farm and the farmer committing to provide a seasonal share of fresh and sustainably-grown produce. By supporting a local agricultural enterprise, the community not only contributes to long-term local economic sustainability, but also is able to gain access to fresh, healthful and ethically-sourced food. CSA empowers both the farmer and the local community to engage in a mutually beneficial partnership.
