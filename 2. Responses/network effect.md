The Network Effect is a phenomenon in which the value of a particular product or service increases exponentially for any given user as the number of other users of that product or service increases. It is a positive feedback loop generated by the increasing number of users, as the product or service becomes more attractive with more users. This creates a strong incentive for users to join the network, leading to rapid growth in usage and benefits, which reinforces the network effect even further.
