Network State refers to the collective dynamics of interactions between the members of a network — such as individuals, groups, or organizations — that affect the flow of information and energy. It is not something that can be easily reduced and predetermined by linear models, as the flows of influence between network members are highly dynamic, complex, and depend on the individual and collective state of the network. The network state includes all of the factors influencing the relationship between members, such as connectivity, information transfer, trust, trustworthiness, shared values, diversity, dynamics of reciprocity, and behavioral patterns.
