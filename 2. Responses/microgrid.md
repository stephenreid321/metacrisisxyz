A microgrid is a localized energy system of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources (DER) connected to a common local power grid. It is designed to supplement or even substitute for the main electricity grid in order to provide more reliable, resilient and low-cost energy for its inhabitants. By using renewable sources or other distributed energy sources, it is possible to increase the efficiency of the energy production and consumption in a microgrid while maintaining the balance between the local and the main electricity grid. This will facilitate the deployment of clean energy technologies while providing local energy storage capability thus reducing dependence on the main grid.
