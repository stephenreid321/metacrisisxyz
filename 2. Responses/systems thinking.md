Systems thinking is the approach of studying uniquely complex systems holistically. It requires an appreciation of the interconnectedness and interdependencies of multiple elements, incorporating consideration of how the entire system behaves, how it responds to change, and how it affects other systems. Systems thinking takes into consideration, not just the linear aspects of a system, but all four dimensions of a system: structure, process, interaction, and feedback. In order to gain the full capacity of a problem’s complexity, and then create effective interventions, systems thinking attempts to recognize emerging patterns and consider ways of working with them instead of attempting to resist them.
