Plant medicine is an umbrella term referring to the use of medicinal plants for the purpose of restoring balance and harmony within the individual. This includes traditional Indigenous practices such as Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, and the study of Western Herbalism, as well as emerging fields such as Phytotherapy. Rather than treating symptoms, plant medicines employ a holistic approach to treat the cause of the imbalance, ultimately promoting an individual's overall health and wellbeing.
