Dance is the art of movement and expression, which combines physical coordination, native creativity, and a type of mental presence that is necessary to express the idea or feeling behind the movement in an alluring way. It provides a key means to a physical and spiritual sense of freedom, allowing for its practitioners to express their unique form of movement and combine it with varying emotions, varying relationships with music, and a sense of personal and communal unity. Dance is a powerful means to enhance the body, mind, and soul, and the study and practice thereof can unlock a profound understanding of body, inner being, as well as a connection to a greater collective of humanity.
