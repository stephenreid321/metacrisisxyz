Morning Pages, first described by Julia Cameron in her book The Artistâ€™s Way, is a powerful journaling technique that involves writing in a dedicated journal for a set period of time, typically at the start of each day. This writing should not be focused on specific goals, tasks, or ideas, but instead should focus on your emotional state, thoughts, anxieties, stresses, creative ideas, and more. It is important for this writing to be succinct and focused, with the goal of allowing oneself to gain more insight into their emotions, write out unresolved scenarios, and to better understand the creative process. Through this technique, Morning Pages have been found to effectively reduce stress and give practitioners a deeper understanding of their creative inclinations, allowing them to have a more critical approach regarding certain decisions.
