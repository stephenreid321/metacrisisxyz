Singing is the art of producing sounds with the human voice, ranging from speech to vocal music. Through a combination of learned technique and embodied expression, the vocal artist can control the muscularity and tension of the vocal and respiratory apparatus to produce various pitches, dynamics, and timbres. Singing has the potential to both profoundly connect listeners emotionally and to help them explore perspectives and insights beyond the limits of traditional language and communication. In its highest form, singing is a powerful bridge between the individual and collective experience.
