Eating well is a precise and intentional way of nourishing oneself, with an emphasis on the impact that food has on the body, mind, and emotional wellbeing. This approach to nutrition goes beyond simply consuming enough calories, nutrients, and minerals; instead, it looks more holistically at the quality of the food and how it affects hormones, metabolism, inflammation, sleep, energy, and digestion. By eating well, one seeks to find a balance between pleasure and nourishment, building an eating pattern personalized to support optimal health while enjoying the overall experience.
