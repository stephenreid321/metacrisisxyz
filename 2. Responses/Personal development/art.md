Art is the process of cultivating a deep understanding of the essence of consciousness, exploring Awareness as it manifests through creative expression and the harmonizing of objects and energies in the world. Art is a vehicle for the exploration of the interplay between concept, beauty, and truth. It is a way for artists to express the inexpressible, to capture the intangible, and to explore the divine dimension within the created world. Art is an ultimate expression of human potential — a path of creativity, imagination, realization, and communication.
