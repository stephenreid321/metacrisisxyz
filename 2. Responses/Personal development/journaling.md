Journaling is a practice of conscious, reflective writing with the aim of increasing clarity of inner thought processes and intentional development of cognitive clarity. It is a form of self-inquiry that provides an opportunity to assess the range of thoughts, concerns, issues, and circumstances that we may be experiencing in real time. By setting the intention to bring conscious awareness to the thoughts and emotions that may be underlying our daily thematic experiences and activities, we allow ourselves to truly explore and reflect on our stories, beliefs, and self-reflections that exist in the subconscious, helping us to gain a greater understanding of who we are and who we want to be.
