Music is an art form consisting of inherent emotional expression through timbre, rhythmical patterns, harmony, and form. Music carries a unique power to evoke and evoke a powerful range of feelings, from joy and remembrance to sadness and sorrow. Just as with any other form of art, music can transmit ideas and values â€“ bringing to light sensations that are often beyond the capacity of words. Music has its own grammar and syntax, which can be used to create complex constructions that can move us deeply. This capacity of music to affect and inform us carries a tremendous potential to bring us nearer to understanding the fundamental mysteries of the human experience.
