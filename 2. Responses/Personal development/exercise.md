Exercise is the voluntary exertion of physical or mental effort to bridge a gap between current and desired well-being. It helps us to find balance between passive and active restorative activities, allowing us to gain greater awareness of our physical and mental states, and how they interact with our environment. It should be undertaken to optimize physical health and psychological/emotional resilience, and with mindfulness of the relationship between effort and reward.
