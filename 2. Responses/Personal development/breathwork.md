Breathwork is a powerful practice of deliberate breathing that can be used to generate increased states of awareness, well-being, and emotional resilience. It can also be used as a technique to access and release suppressed feelings and patterns of behavior, unblock energy, reduce stress, and create insight and clarity. In a postgraduate setting, breathwork often includes awareness of the conscious and unconscious functions of the breath, as well as the psychological, physiological and spiritual implications of taking conscious control of one's breathing. With practice, breathwork can help to cultivate deeper states of presence, improved cognition, and emotional balance.
