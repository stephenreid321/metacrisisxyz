Meditation is a practice of sustained, mindful awareness of the present moment that helps us build greater resilience and self-regulation of thought, emotion, and behavior. Mindful awareness involves conscious and intentional attention to the inner landscape, being aware of the content of thought, emotion, and sensation as they arise, while the practice of sustained attention refers to noticing and acknowledging these experiences without reacting, judgment, or attachment. Through deepening our capacity for presence, meditation can help allow us to be in tune with and better respond to both external events and our inner states.
