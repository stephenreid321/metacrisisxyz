Sleeping well is the capability of achieving and sustaining an optimal state of physical, mental, and emotional homeostasis during sleep. At its best, this means that individuals are able to achieve a sufficient level of restfulness, relaxation, and restoration during sleep, such that they wake up feeling energized and ready to face the day. This means being able to get sufficient restful sleep night after night, with appropriate scheduling, making sure that other activities do not disturb the person’s rest and sleep patterns, and making sure that environmental conditions are conducive to a good night’s sleep. While this is more challenging for some due to various factors, sleep is an essential part of health and wellbeing, and sleeping well should remain an achievable goal.
