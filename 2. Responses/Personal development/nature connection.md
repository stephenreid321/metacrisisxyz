Nature connection refers to the recognition that all of our lives and experiences are deeply intertwined with—and dependent upon—the natural environment. Nature connection is about building and nurturing a sense of connection and harmony between ourselves and nature, understanding that all species have a place in the natural web of life, and making a conscious effort to incorporate nature into our lives. Through activities such as farming, nature immersion, permaculture, parkour, herbalism, and mindful outdoor activity, we can create a stronger bond with nature, foster better stewardship of our planet, and better understand our place within the natural environment.
