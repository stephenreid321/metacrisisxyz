Psychedelics are a class of psychoactive compounds with the ability to induce altered states of consciousness through the activation of serotonin 2A receptor pathways in the brain. By modulating mood and perceptual awareness, psychedelics offer profound insight into the mind and potential for therapeutic breakthroughs, as they can be used to treat a variety of mental health issues including anxiety, depression, PTSD, addiction, and more. In addition, psychedelics are shown to have profound spiritual experiences related to meditation, self-reflection, and introspection. By challenging the conditioned views of reality, exploration of psychedelics provides the opportunity to gain new perspectives and mental flexibility.
