A decentralized society is a governance model which utilises network structures and decentralized technologies such as blockchain to enable a more open, transparent, and secure type of governance. In this system, resources, decision-making authority, and value are all spread across the network rather than concentrated in a few central locations or authorities. Through decentralized governance, collaboration between individuals, organisations, and entities can be enabled without compromising the ability of individual actors to act independently and be self-determined. It is a system which aims to empower individuals, organisations, and citizens to have more direct control over the decisions that affect them and increase overall freedom and autonomy.
