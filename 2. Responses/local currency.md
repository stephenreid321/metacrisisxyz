Local currency is a supplementary form of money that functions only within a specific local area. It is created either by a government or a cooperative enterprise, and its use is limited to the area from which the currency originates. It is designed to function as an alternative to the conventional currency of a country, allowing local businesses to exchange goods and services with members of their community without having to rely on mainstream monetary systems. Often, local currencies are promoted as a way to encourage economic activity within a specific area, creating jobs and bringing new life to local businesses.
