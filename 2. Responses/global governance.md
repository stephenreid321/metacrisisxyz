Global Governance refers to the actions and decisions of global institutions, organizations and initiatives, as well as governments and citizens, in order to promote collective action and a better coordination of global public policy, initiatives and activities. Its purpose is to establish global rules and norms, as well as a framework of policies, to create a more sustainable, equitable and just world. Global Governance is both an expression of global citizenship and an effective way for all actors to cooperate in managing the global commons. Most importantly, it is an active embracing of our shared human responsibility for the future of our planet.
