all</text><text start="5.04" dur="3.24">of these different actors and a race</text><text start="6.42" dur="3.84">with each other you would say that&apos;s a</text><text start="8.28" dur="5.1">property of the superorganism now we&apos;re</text><text start="10.26" dur="5.039">dropping down a layer to say that</text><text start="13.38" dur="3.12">property of the superorganism is what</text><text start="15.299" dur="2.941">makes it to where all these players</text><text start="16.5" dur="4.02">don&apos;t feel like they actually have the</text><text start="18.24" dur="4.02">capability of doing the ethical thing</text><text start="20.52" dur="2.519">because they will just be kind of priced</text><text start="22.26" dur="3.54">out</text><text start="23.039" dur="5.641">and even if they&apos;re ethical individual</text><text start="25.8" dur="5.76">humans their position within the</text><text start="28.68" dur="6.059">economic hierarchy doesn&apos;t allow them to</text><text start="31.56" dur="6.36">express their ethical View</text><text start="34.739" dur="5.881">yeah and in general you know I think we</text><text start="37.92" dur="3.659">talked about this once that</text><text start="40.62" dur="5.759">um</text><text start="41.579" dur="7.881">if we look at China&apos;s taking of Tibet or</text><text start="46.379" dur="6.081">uh colonialist taking of Native American</text><text start="49.46" dur="6.36">you know territories via genocide in the</text><text start="52.46" dur="3.36">founding of the US</text><text start="55.86" dur="4.379">it wasn&apos;t based on who the more ethical</text><text start="57.66" dur="5.219">actor was it wasn&apos;t based on</text><text start="60.239" dur="4.92">um which civilization should be in terms</text><text start="62.879" dur="5.041">of some philosophical true good and</text><text start="65.159" dur="4.981">beautiful it was based on effective</text><text start="67.92" dur="4.08">dominance which is the combination of</text><text start="70.14" dur="5.4">violence and economic productive</text><text start="72.0" dur="5.28">capacity and so</text><text start="75.54" dur="4.079">um given that</text><text start="77.28" dur="6.12">what ends up winning</text><text start="79.619" dur="6.301">in a very darwinian sense and</text><text start="83.4" dur="4.56">what is good in an ethical or</text><text start="85.92" dur="3.66">philosophic sense or even in a long-term</text><text start="87.96" dur="3.54">viability sense aren&apos;t the same thing</text><text start="89.58" dur="4.32">that&apos;s at the core of something we have</text><text start="91.5" dur="5.34">to address right is that where you have</text><text start="93.9" dur="5.7">a scenario that what wins in the short</text><text start="96.84" dur="4.739">term forces everybody to race towards</text><text start="99.6" dur="3.659">that thing even if everyone racing</text><text start="101.579" dur="4.261">towards that thing makes an entire</text><text start="103.259" dur="5.101">system self-terminate in the long term</text><text start="105.84" dur="4.38">and that&apos;s what we call the multi-polar</text><text start="108.36" dur="4.02">Trap it&apos;s expressed in the tragedy of</text><text start="110.22" dur="3.899">the commons the military arms race the</text><text start="112.38" dur="4.32">market race to the bottom</text><text start="114.119" dur="4.621">and you could Define it as a property of</text><text start="116.7" dur="3.72">the superorganism to exploit all the</text><text start="118.74" dur="3.0">energy in its environments and then hit</text><text start="120.42" dur="4.799">a cliff</text><text start="121.74" dur="5.4">and we know that like typically you have</text><text start="125.219" dur="3.661">the peak number of cancer cells in a</text><text start="127.14" dur="3.179">person&apos;s body right before they die and</text><text start="128.88" dur="3.9">then all the cancer cells die when they</text><text start="130.319" dur="3.961">kill the host so the cancer cells</text><text start="132.78" dur="3.539">individually</text><text start="134.28" dur="4.08">are utilizing</text><text start="136.319" dur="3.661">metabolic resource faster than the other</text><text start="138.36" dur="2.879">cells and reproducing faster than the</text><text start="139.98" dur="4.92">other cells so it seems like they&apos;re</text><text start="141.239" dur="5.461">winning at a very short term game but</text><text start="144.9" dur="4.979">they are actually then killing the hosts</text><text start="146.7" dur="5.399">that they depend upon and so uh</text><text start="149.879" dur="4.141">lots of people have drawn the analogy</text><text start="152.099" dur="3.741">that human presence on the biosphere</text><text start="154.02" dur="5.7">looks a lot like a cancer</text><text start="155.84" dur="5.92">where it is maximizing its extraction</text><text start="159.72" dur="4.019">from that which it depends upon in a way</text><text start="161.76" dur="3.36">that is actually breaking the substrate</text><text start="163.739" dur="4.08">it depends upon</text><text start="165.12" dur="4.1">so is the purpose of this conversation</text><text start="167.819" dur="4.681">to</text><text start="169.22" dur="5.32">educate and influence cancer cells to</text><text start="172.5" dur="3.42">become self-aware to change their</text><text start="174.54" dur="3.0">behaviors</text><text start="175.92" dur="5.039">well I think one of the things we&apos;re</text><text start="177.54" dur="5.479">also talking about that&apos;s tricky is</text><text start="180.959" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="185.28" dur="5.22">where it seems like</text><text start="187.8" dur="4.799">the cancer cell Behavior</text><text start="190.5" dur="4.08">is actually following rational</text><text start="192.599" dur="5.401">self-interest</text><text start="194.58" dur="5.04">defined by the game theoretics of if I</text><text start="198.0" dur="3.3">stop being a cancer cell the body&apos;s</text><text start="199.62" dur="3.119">still going to die</text><text start="201.3" dur="3.78">right because I can&apos;t stop everybody</text><text start="202.739" dur="4.08">else from doing it and so unless I can</text><text start="205.08" dur="3.9">stop a certain critical mass from doing</text><text start="206.819" dur="5.34">it and this gets down to the</text><text start="208.98" dur="4.8">if we don&apos;t cut the trees down but we</text><text start="212.159" dur="4.141">don&apos;t have some rule of law that makes</text><text start="213.78" dur="4.8">sure nobody does then all it means is</text><text start="216.3" dur="4.019">the other tribe that&apos;s in competition</text><text start="218.58" dur="3.719">with us Cuts all the trees down we still</text><text start="220.319" dur="3.361">don&apos;t get to protect the forest and</text><text start="222.299" dur="2.94">they&apos;ll use that economic advantage</text><text start="223.68" dur="3.3">against us in the next tribal Warfare</text><text start="225.239" dur="3.121">and we&apos;re so not only are we</text><text start="226.98" dur="3.0">going to cut the trees down faster than</text><text start="228.36" dur="3.06">we need we&apos;re going to race to cut them</text><text start="229.98" dur="4.319">down faster than the other guy because</text><text start="231.42" dur="6.599">we can&apos;t get everyone to agree not to</text><text start="234.299" dur="8.541">which is why at least at first hearing</text><text start="238.019" dur="8.881">about the ecological biophysical</text><text start="242.84" dur="6.28">Narrative of the superorganism when</text><text start="246.9" dur="3.72">you&apos;re gonna tell me where where yours</text><text start="249.12" dur="4.199">fits in here</text><text start="250.62" dur="5.64">at least at first feels to someone that</text><text start="253.319" dur="6.121">they don&apos;t have any agency because what</text><text start="256.26" dur="6.2">is one person&apos;s change due to this</text><text start="259.44" dur="5.699">larger Dynamic that you&apos;re describing</text><text start="262.46" dur="4.42">so if we take an example if we try to</text><text start="265.139" dur="3.361">get hopeful and we say but let&apos;s look at</text><text start="266.88" dur="4.5">where we did change really bad things</text><text start="268.5" dur="4.259">because some small number of one persons</text><text start="271.38" dur="3.48">really did stand up for something they</text><text start="272.759" dur="5.041">got other one persons to stand up they</text><text start="274.86" dur="5.1">got a critical mass and we shifted it</text><text start="277.8" dur="4.74">um let&apos;s take a couple examples that are</text><text start="279.96" dur="5.42">often given let&apos;s take</text><text start="282.54" dur="5.28">um cigarettes or</text><text start="285.38" dur="6.94">Mothers Against Drunk Driving and seat</text><text start="287.82" dur="8.52">belts or hfc CFCs in Ozone</text><text start="292.32" dur="8.64">we could give plenty of examples but the</text><text start="296.34" dur="6.359">it&apos;s true that we have not</text><text start="300.96" dur="3.299">that we don&apos;t have a history or we&apos;ve</text><text start="302.699" dur="4.381">never solved anything that matters</text><text start="304.259" dur="5.22">ecologically or socially like there are</text><text start="307.08" dur="4.8">some times where people out of concern</text><text start="309.479" dur="5.16">for the commons have went against some</text><text start="311.88" dur="5.46">Profit Stream and actually one a thing</text><text start="314.639" dur="3.961">but they are different and kind than</text><text start="317.34" dur="2.34">what we&apos;re facing now and I want to</text><text start="318.6" dur="4.98">point out where they&apos;re different and</text><text start="319.68" dur="5.7">kind and different in scale but go on</text><text start="323.58" dur="2.88">they&apos;re different than scale and and</text><text start="325.38" dur="2.28">different in kind in a way that&apos;s</text><text start="326.46" dur="4.019">connected</text><text start="327.66" dur="4.62">so if we look at cigarettes and four out</text><text start="330.479" dur="3.481">of five doctors choose Camel cigarettes</text><text start="332.28" dur="3.18">we obviously haven&apos;t gotten rid of</text><text start="333.96" dur="3.48">cigarettes but we&apos;ve made it to where</text><text start="335.46" dur="3.42">you have to be 18 to buy them and they</text><text start="337.44" dur="2.64">have to have a surgeon general&apos;s warning</text><text start="338.88" dur="2.58">that this will kill you before you use</text><text start="340.08" dur="2.52">it and we&apos;ve definitely decreased the</text><text start="341.46" dur="2.519">total number of people that use</text><text start="342.6" dur="3.3">cigarettes and they can&apos;t use them in</text><text start="343.979" dur="4.381">the buildings and stuff</text><text start="345.9" dur="5.639">that took a lot of work a lot of people</text><text start="348.36" dur="4.5">died of lung cancer and second hand lung</text><text start="351.539" dur="2.781">cancer first</text><text start="352.86" dur="5.399">Etc</text><text start="354.32" dur="5.62">for a vested interest Profit Stream that</text><text start="358.259" dur="4.22">knew it was wrong from well before it</text><text start="359.94" dur="2.539">was regulated</text><text start="362.52" dur="5.16">um but the sale of tobacco as big a deal</text><text start="365.28" dur="5.52">as it was was not</text><text start="367.68" dur="5.76">at it was not the engine of creation for</text><text start="370.8" dur="4.679">the economy as a whole it was one sector</text><text start="373.44" dur="5.06">of the economy as one product</text><text start="375.479" dur="6.961">when we&apos;re talking about climate change</text><text start="378.5" dur="6.46">as you focus on there are no industries</text><text start="382.44" dur="4.44">that don&apos;t need energy there is no such</text><text start="384.96" dur="4.92">thing as even the possibility of any</text><text start="386.88" dur="4.86">good or service that doesn&apos;t need energy</text><text start="389.88" dur="4.8">so when we&apos;re trying to deal with</text><text start="391.74" dur="5.459">something that is the byproduct of using</text><text start="394.68" dur="4.32">energy itself it is connected to the</text><text start="397.199" dur="3.481">machine of creation rather than one</text><text start="399.0" dur="4.68">little area in the same way that it&apos;s</text><text start="400.68" dur="4.859">like hfcs and CFCs not every single</text><text start="403.68" dur="3.299">industry was based on aerosol</text><text start="405.539" dur="3.72">propellants</text><text start="406.979" dur="4.321">and so you were able to change that</text><text start="409.259" dur="3.901">without having to change macroeconomics</text><text start="411.3" dur="3.42">you really only had to change an</text><text start="413.16" dur="3.78">industry and so you could get enough</text><text start="414.72" dur="3.66">Force to do it when you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="416.94" dur="3.12">change</text><text start="418.38" dur="3.84">something that is at the heart of</text><text start="420.06" dur="3.3">macroeconomics itself the vested</text><text start="422.22" dur="2.4">interests that are against it is</text><text start="423.36" dur="3.3">everything</text><text start="424.62" dur="4.74">and it&apos;s not only that every industry</text><text start="426.66" dur="4.44">and thus every single business requires</text><text start="429.36" dur="4.26">it it&apos;s that also every nation states</text><text start="431.1" dur="6.12">geopolitical position requires it</text><text start="433.62" dur="6.24">so literally power itself is bound to it</text><text start="437.22" dur="5.699">so the entire Machinery of power will</text><text start="439.86" dur="4.8">resist anything that would decrease its</text><text start="442.919" dur="4.201">relative power capacity</text><text start="444.66" dur="3.96">and this is why from backing out of the</text><text start="447.12" dur="4.26">Kyoto treaty to whatever the whole</text><text start="448.62" dur="4.44">history of the thing why has it been so</text><text start="451.38" dur="6.599">hard is</text><text start="453.06" dur="4.919">because if any</text><text start="458.699" dur="5.94">so there you know the market can get us</text><text start="462.12" dur="4.079">to organize based on incentive but if</text><text start="464.639" dur="3.541">incentive isn&apos;t adequate and we actually</text><text start="466.199" dur="3.361">have to use a anti-incentive we have to</text><text start="468.18" dur="3.9">use a deterrent the market doesn&apos;t</text><text start="469.56" dur="3.84">really do deterrence well so you have a</text><text start="472.08" dur="2.76">state that does that which is you make</text><text start="473.4" dur="3.359">it illegal and someone will get arrested</text><text start="474.84" dur="4.34">if they break the law or their business</text><text start="476.759" dur="5.22">will stop being able to operate</text><text start="479.18" dur="4.84">so we this multi-polar trap that we talk</text><text start="481.979" dur="3.961">about where there is some near-term</text><text start="484.02" dur="3.36">incentive where if any agent does that</text><text start="485.94" dur="2.94">they win in the short term and it</text><text start="487.38" dur="3.539">creates a race for everybody to do that</text><text start="488.88" dur="3.96">we&apos;ve figured out how to solve</text><text start="490.919" dur="4.68">multi-polar traps inside of a</text><text start="492.84" dur="4.859">nation-state by rule of law and Monopoly</text><text start="495.599" dur="4.021">of force and enforcement so we can say</text><text start="497.699" dur="2.761">no we&apos;re not going to cut down all the</text><text start="499.62" dur="2.34">trees we&apos;re going to have a national</text><text start="500.46" dur="4.44">park we&apos;re going to keep trees in the</text><text start="501.96" dur="7.1">national park and no logger is allowed</text><text start="504.9" dur="8.1">to cut there and what that means is a a</text><text start="509.06" dur="5.74">monopoly of violence will forcibly stop</text><text start="513.0" dur="4.58">you if you&apos;re cutting there and take you</text><text start="514.8" dur="5.76">to jail to protect the rule of law right</text><text start="517.58" dur="7.0">and so inside of a nation-state we&apos;re</text><text start="520.56" dur="5.779">able to prevent most multi-polar traps</text><text start="524.58" dur="5.04">but we do not have international</text><text start="526.339" dur="5.981">governance to deal with global ones and</text><text start="529.62" dur="5.279">so then we end up getting the various</text><text start="532.32" dur="3.84">nation states competing with each other</text><text start="534.899" dur="4.141">and</text><text start="536.16" dur="4.92">that you know this is both this is why</text><text start="539.04" dur="4.44">there is a desire for something like</text><text start="541.08" dur="4.56">Global governance is because</text><text start="543.48" dur="4.74">the global oceans or the global</text><text start="545.64" dur="5.34">atmosphere or the global biodiversity or</text><text start="548.22" dur="4.98">Global Commons that we depend upon can&apos;t</text><text start="550.98" dur="3.74">have a

start="556.74" dur="4.5">right choice the reason we don&apos;t want a</text><text start="558.959" dur="4.44">One World Government is because</text><text start="561.24" dur="3.9">how do you have something that has that</text><text start="563.399" dur="3.781">much power that doesn&apos;t become corrupt</text><text start="565.14" dur="5.639">and how do you ensure that there are</text><text start="567.18" dur="5.279">checks and balances on it so we do need</text><text start="570.779" dur="3.961">something like effective Global</text><text start="572.459" dur="5.101">governance which does not have to be a</text><text start="574.74" dur="4.68">government it can be a decentralized</text><text start="577.56" dur="5.0">process but that still allows us to</text><text start="579.42"
