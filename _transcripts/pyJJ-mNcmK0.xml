start="22.26" dur="4.2">in half an hour</text><text start="23.939" dur="4.741">because uh you&apos;ve been doing like so</text><text start="26.46" dur="4.8">many great podcasts about the meta</text><text start="28.68" dur="5.039">crisis during lasting three to four</text><text start="31.26" dur="4.38">hours and I suggest that people go and</text><text start="33.719" dur="4.081">watch them on on internet they&apos;re very</text><text start="35.64" dur="4.079">good we&apos;ll start with the Harvest of the</text><text start="37.8" dur="5.16">day the question I&apos;m asking to all the</text><text start="39.719" dur="5.881">guests here for Harvard podcast if</text><text start="42.96" dur="5.099">something easy or simple could be done</text><text start="45.6" dur="6.0">and will make the world a better place</text><text start="48.059" dur="5.34">what would it be for you Daniel when I</text><text start="51.6" dur="3.84">saw the note that you sent me that that</text><text start="53.399" dur="3.48">would be a last question is there a</text><text start="55.44" dur="2.88">simple or easy thing that everyone could</text><text start="56.879" dur="4.081">do that make the world a better place I</text><text start="58.32" dur="5.76">kind of cringed because I usually really</text><text start="60.96" dur="5.58">I&apos;m not a fan of that question because</text><text start="64.08" dur="3.84">the world needs so many different kinds</text><text start="66.54" dur="3.48">of things done that require different</text><text start="67.92" dur="4.5">skills and capacities and orientations</text><text start="70.02" dur="5.16">and to try to reduce it to some thing</text><text start="72.42" dur="4.68">that would be true for everybody you get</text><text start="75.18" dur="3.72">a platitude like be kind or loving or</text><text start="77.1" dur="3.24">something like that or you get something</text><text start="78.9" dur="3.6">like</text><text start="80.34" dur="3.959">recycle or pick up trash or try to use</text><text start="82.5" dur="3.36">less carbon or something that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="84.299" dur="4.201">map to the whole set of things that the</text><text start="85.86" dur="3.74">world needs I think there&apos;s a process</text><text start="88.5" dur="3.6">where</text><text start="89.6" dur="6.4">movements have been</text><text start="92.1" dur="6.6">associated with political processes and</text><text start="96.0" dur="4.38">markets in a way that it&apos;s like</text><text start="98.7" dur="3.9">here&apos;s this great catastrophe that&apos;ll</text><text start="100.38" dur="3.66">happen if the other side gets elected so</text><text start="102.6" dur="3.78">everybody needs to get out and vote for</text><text start="104.04" dur="3.719">so and so and that&apos;s like everybody can</text><text start="106.38" dur="3.9">do a simple thing because we&apos;re relating</text><text start="107.759" dur="4.921">to everybody as voters</text><text start="110.28" dur="5.58">um or everybody donate to this cause or</text><text start="112.68" dur="5.759">boycott this thing but the complexity of</text><text start="115.86" dur="5.82">the world&apos;s issues from climate issues</text><text start="118.439" dur="4.801">to AI risk to supply chain issues to</text><text start="121.68" dur="4.32">electrical grid

start="128.22" dur="4.26">donate to that addresses it one thing</text><text start="130.319" dur="4.14">that is not necessarily easy but is</text><text start="132.48" dur="4.8">relatively simple</text><text start="134.459" dur="6.241">it would be great if everybody in the</text><text start="137.28" dur="6.06">world could do more is to seek to try to</text><text start="140.7" dur="5.28">understand other people&apos;s perspectives</text><text start="143.34" dur="4.68">much more deeply particularly those that</text><text start="145.98" dur="3.839">are most different than their own uh if</text><text start="148.02" dur="6.02">you can</text><text start="149.819" dur="8.041">try to take the opposite perspective on</text><text start="154.04" dur="6.76">abortion on gun

argument that the</text><text start="171.48" dur="3.479">person on the other side would make as</text><text start="173.879" dur="3.36">well enough that they don&apos;t have</text><text start="174.959" dur="5.401">anything to add to it and not just as a</text><text start="177.239" dur="5.161">rhetorical process but connect to the</text><text start="180.36" dur="3.72">values that they care about and what it</text><text start="182.4" dur="3.479">feels like to be them and say the world</text><text start="184.08" dur="3.36">through their eyes realizing that there</text><text start="185.879" dur="3.241">might be Distortion there might be a lot</text><text start="187.44" dur="5.64">of things missing but there&apos;s not zero</text><text start="189.12" dur="7.14">truth or zero value to it that process</text><text start="193.08" dur="5.239">if everyone did that would actually</text><text start="196.26" dur="4.74">result in</text><text start="198.319" dur="4.481">addressing the meta crisis in all of its</text><text start="201.0" dur="4.099">complexity the issues in synthetic</text><text start="202.8" dur="4.62">biology risk and pandemics and</text><text start="205.099" dur="4.36">escalation Pathways to Warfare and</text><text start="207.42" dur="3.84">economic issues and geopolitical issues</text><text start="209.459" dur="3.78">and all of them because you can kind of</text><text start="211.26" dur="5.22">say that they either come down to</text><text start="213.239" dur="5.941">conflict or externalities like we cause</text><text start="216.48" dur="4.28">harm directly intentionally which a war</text><text start="219.18" dur="4.68">is a great example of</text><text start="220.76" dur="6.52">uh or harm gets caused that we didn&apos;t</text><text start="223.86" dur="5.4">intend to cause so no one intended to</text><text start="227.28" dur="4.379">cause climate change we just wanted to</text><text start="229.26" dur="4.68">have transportation and energy and the</text><text start="231.659" dur="3.541">secondary you know byproduct of that was</text><text start="233.94" dur="3.48">climate change</text><text start="235.2" dur="3.899">uh all of the environmental issues no</text><text start="237.42" dur="3.06">one intentionally had a conflict with</text><text start="239.099" dur="2.881">the environment that was causing it it</text><text start="240.48" dur="2.819">was the externality of optimizing</text><text start="241.98" dur="1.979">something and causing harm somewhere</text><text start="243.299" dur="2.041">else</text><text start="243.959" dur="3.36">and so</text><text start="245.34" dur="3.24">there are problems that we intentionally</text><text start="247.319" dur="3.361">cause in their problems that we</text><text start="248.58" dur="4.2">accidentally cause both of them would be</text><text start="250.68" dur="3.96">corrected by seeking to understand all</text><text start="252.78" dur="3.299">the perspectives more because if you</text><text start="254.64" dur="2.76">sought to understand the perspectives</text><text start="256.079" dur="5.041">well enough conflict theory would</text><text start="257.4" dur="5.34">evaporate and most of the mistakes when</text><text start="261.12" dur="3.42">you&apos;re trying to optimize for one thing</text><text start="262.74" dur="3.84">and you end up causing externalities to</text><text start="264.54" dur="3.599">something else somebody else saw that</text><text start="266.58" dur="3.48">and knew that and if you were in wide</text><text start="268.139" dur="4.201">enough conversations</text><text start="270.06" dur="3.72">then the thing that you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="272.34" dur="2.7">optimize for that&apos;s going to cause harm</text><text start="273.78" dur="2.82">somewhere else someone else would have</text><text start="275.04" dur="3.42">mentioned and said actually let&apos;s</text><text start="276.6" dur="4.86">improve your design or your strategy by</text><text start="278.46" dur="4.62">factoring this so both the unintentional</text><text start="281.46" dur="3.32">externalities and the intentional</text><text start="283.08" dur="4.14">conflict would be resolved through</text><text start="284.78" dur="4.419">active perspective seeking and then</text><text start="287.22" dur="3.539">perspective synthesis</text><text start="289.199" dur="2.401">wonderful</text><text start="290.759" dur="2.821">um</text><text start="291.6" dur="3.659">when you look at the history as you said</text><text start="293.58" dur="4.98">like humans seem to have like a talent</text><text start="295.259" dur="7.621">for um Innovation and progress but also</text><text start="298.56" dur="6.18">a natural tendency for war and uh chaos</text><text start="302.88" dur="5.22">um these two tenancies feed each other</text><text start="304.74" dur="4.679">and make things bigger and bigger so</text><text start="308.1" dur="4.02">greatness but out of control</text><text start="309.419" dur="4.741">Technologies can cause a huge damage</text><text start="312.12" dur="4.38">what do you think</text><text start="314.16" dur="4.86">um should be about should be done about</text><text start="316.5" dur="4.139">Technologies and do they represent like</text><text start="319.02" dur="4.2">innovation</text><text start="320.639" dur="4.62">are a danger for you</text><text start="323.22" dur="3.36">first thing about technology is that</text><text start="325.259" dur="2.761">even if we&apos;re not talking about a</text><text start="326.58" dur="3.54">military technology we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="328.02" dur="4.019">technology for some other purpose even</text><text start="330.12" dur="3.419">if we develop a technology for some</text><text start="332.039" dur="3.181">non-military purpose it will have a</text><text start="333.539" dur="3.421">military application or some kind of</text><text start="335.22" dur="3.84">conflict oriented application that</text><text start="336.96" dur="5.7">basically saying all technology is dual</text><text start="339.06" dur="6.3">use so maybe we&apos;re doing the synthetic</text><text start="342.66" dur="4.86">biology Gene editing for trying to cure</text><text start="345.36" dur="3.899">cancer but as we get better at making</text><text start="347.52" dur="3.959">tools to do Gene editing can that be</text><text start="349.259" dur="4.561">used for bioweapons totally</text><text start="351.479" dur="4.5">um maybe we&apos;re making the AI to try to</text><text start="353.82" dur="4.2">do drug Discovery but can that same AI</text><text start="355.979" dur="4.201">do autonomous drones and</text><text start="358.02" dur="4.32">of course you can whatever purpose we&apos;re</text><text start="360.18" dur="4.32">developing technology for</text><text start="362.34" dur="6.18">we&apos;re also making that technology</text><text start="364.5" dur="6.479">cheaper and easier for all other types</text><text start="368.52" dur="5.04">of purposes simultaneously and that&apos;s a</text><text start="370.979" dur="5.28">huge thing we have to factor from a</text><text start="373.56" dur="4.8">conflict point of view obviously</text><text start="376.259" dur="4.021">uh people with Stone Age Technology</text><text start="378.36" dur="4.44">can&apos;t cause a war that blows the world</text><text start="380.28" dur="4.08">up and people with Bronze Age Technology</text><text start="382.8" dur="3.839">can cause a war that blows the world up</text><text start="384.36" dur="3.66">the the harm is proportional to the</text><text start="386.639" dur="3.56">amount of tech so as we move into</text><text start="388.02" dur="5.58">exponentially more powerful Tech</text><text start="390.199" dur="6.161">we can&apos;t continue to use it with the</text><text start="393.6" dur="4.98">types of conflict orientation in</text><text start="396.36" dur="3.6">responsibility we used previous Tech the</text><text start="398.58" dur="3.739">other thing is that even when we&apos;re not</text><text start="399.96" dur="4.92">using tech for intentionally</text><text start="402.319" dur="4.901">conflict-oriented purposes all of the</text><text start="404.88" dur="5.46">tech we use does externalize harm</text><text start="407.22" dur="4.319">in different ways so you know whether</text><text start="410.34" dur="4.199">we&apos;re talking about agricultural</text><text start="411.539" dur="4.38">technology where the nitrogen fertilizer</text><text start="414.539" dur="3.241">have had a lot of people but also causes</text><text start="415.919" dur="4.981">all the dead zones in the ocean and soil</text><text start="417.78" dur="4.919">erosion and biodiversity loss</text><text start="420.9" dur="3.56">um exponentially more technology also</text><text start="422.699" dur="4.381">means exponentially more externalities</text><text start="424.46" dur="3.88">and so we can&apos;t handle exponential war</text><text start="427.08" dur="3.72">and we can&apos;t handle exponential</text><text start="428.34" dur="4.02">externalities so we have to change our</text><text start="430.8" dur="5.1">relationship with technology really</text><text start="432.36" dur="5.94">fundamentally and say no other animal</text><text start="435.9" dur="4.32">have the ability to destroy the</text><text start="438.3" dur="4.38">biosphere that it depends upon</text><text start="440.22" dur="4.02">we now do we did not for all of human</text><text start="442.68" dur="4.739">history so we didn&apos;t have to really</text><text start="444.24" dur="5.88">wrestle with that power we did Kill and</text><text start="447.419" dur="4.62">enslave in genocide and every previous</text><text start="450.12" dur="4.019">civilization doesn&apos;t still exist because</text><text start="452.039" dur="4.681">they all ended up collapsing mostly for</text><text start="454.139" dur="4.861">reasons that were largely self-induced</text><text start="456.72" dur="4.14">even when wars happened often times a</text><text start="459.0" dur="3.84">war that overtook a civilization was</text><text start="460.86" dur="4.739">from an enemy that was</text><text start="462.84" dur="4.079">uh less powerful than ones that they had</text><text start="465.599" dur="2.641">vanquished in their Prime they had</text><text start="466.919" dur="3.241">already went through some internal</text><text start="468.24" dur="3.48">institutional Decay from infighting and</text><text start="470.16" dur="3.36">things like that many early</text><text start="471.72" dur="4.08">civilizations died from environmentally</text><text start="473.52" dur="4.92">induced causes they cut down all the</text><text start="475.8" dur="5.88">trees they overstripped the soil of</text><text start="478.44" dur="5.699">nutrients so civilizational breakdown is</text><text start="481.68" dur="4.919">actually the norm it&apos;s just never been</text><text start="484.139" dur="4.741">at a global level now we don&apos;t live in</text><text start="486.599" dur="5.82">the United States or China we live in a</text><text start="488.88" dur="5.039">place where the cell phone that we&apos;re</text><text start="492.419" dur="2.701">watching this on or the computer were</text><text start="493.919" dur="4.081">watching it on</text><text start="495.12" dur="5.46">took six continent Supply chains to make</text><text start="498.0" dur="4.979">communicating via satellites and so we</text><text start="500.58" dur="3.959">live in a kind of global civilization</text><text start="502.979" dur="3.66">where none of the countries are actually</text><text start="504.539" dur="4.921">autonomous for fundamental things that</text><text start="506.639" dur="4.56">they need now that we do have the</text><text start="509.46" dur="4.199">ability to</text><text start="511.199" dur="4.381">destroy the biosphere either</text><text start="513.659" dur="4.32">very rapidly through exponential</text><text start="515.58" dur="6.0">technology like synthetic biology or AI</text><text start="517.979" dur="5.281">or Warfare or kind of slowly through the</text><text start="521.58" dur="4.08">limits of growth environmental issues</text><text start="523.26" dur="4.8">but that&apos;s not all that slow if you have</text><text start="525.66" dur="4.98">the power to destroy</text><text start="528.06" dur="5.04">the nature that you depend upon you have</text><text start="530.64" dur="4.58">to consciously Steward it or you&apos;ll</text><text start="533.1" dur="5.84">self-terminate so</text><text start="535.22" dur="6.82">the gist is we don&apos;t have</text><text start="538.94" dur="6.1">evolutionary capacities we have trans</text><text start="542.04" dur="4.919">evolutionary capacities meaning but the</text><text start="545.04" dur="3.84">difference yeah yeah so</text><text start="546.959" dur="5.641">and I&apos;m meaning evolution in a biologic</text><text start="548.88" dur="4.86">Evolution sense so another animal has</text><text start="552.6" dur="4.02">the</text><text start="553.74" dur="5.52">capacities that it has corporeally built</text><text start="556.62" dur="4.38">into its body based on its genes so a</text><text start="559.26" dur="5.16">predator can&apos;t become radically more</text><text start="561.0" dur="5.339">predatory quickly it is only through</text><text start="564.42" dur="3.72">genetic mutation that maybe it becomes</text><text start="566.339" dur="3.18">slightly faster or has slightly bigger</text><text start="568.14" dur="3.3">teeth and then it&apos;s going to be a</text><text start="569.519" dur="3.781">relatively small change and then there</text><text start="571.44" dur="3.66">will be co-selection the slightly more</text><text start="573.3" dur="3.479">effective Predator will eat the slightly</text><text start="575.1" dur="4.2">slower praise which means that the</text><text start="576.779" dur="4.861">faster prey genes and breed and you get</text><text start="579.3" dur="4.979">this kind of co-selective process okay</text><text start="581.64" dur="4.74">we through our ability to build tools</text><text start="584.279" dur="5.941">and then tools on tools right recursive</text><text start="586.38" dur="5.579">abstraction if you look at a true apex</text><text start="590.22" dur="4.86">predator you look at an orca in the</text><text start="591.959" dur="5.041">ocean an orca maybe can catch one fish</text><text start="595.08" dur="4.86">at a time one tune at a time then you</text><text start="597.0" dur="4.62">look at a trawling

dur="3.481">geopolitical power will Express itself</text><text start="742.14" dur="4.439">as less military power less trade power</text><text start="744.0" dur="4.279">and particularly with whoever is

start="760.14" dur="4.74">an economics race that is also bound to</text><text start="762.54" dur="5.88">a an actual arms race</text><text start="764.88" dur="5.28">and so and that&apos;s true for

dur="5.161">and on and on and on so if you have an</text><text start="775.92" dur="4.44">issue like the atmosphere right it</text><text start="778.56" dur="3.0">aerosols in the atmosphere and ozone</text><text start="780.36" dur="3.719">layer or you have an issue like the</text><text start="781.56" dur="4.86">oceans or climate change no country can</text><text start="784.079" dur="3.901">solve that problem and any country that</text><text start="786.42" dur="3.479">does the thing that is doing its share</text><text start="787.98" dur="4.62">that is economically

dur="4.38">doesn&apos;t because they are caught in the</text><text start="795.18" dur="4.98">competitive Dynamics yeah so when you</text><text start="798.0" dur="3.6">look at that you&apos;re like all right well</text><text start="800.16" dur="3.0">we need Global government because we</text><text start="801.6" dur="3.179">have Global issues we don&apos;t just have</text><text start="803.16" dur="2.88">National issues and you have to have</text><text start="804.779" dur="2.941">governance at the level that you have</text><text start="806.04" dur="4.02">issues</text><text start="807.72" dur="4.02">but then of course most thinking people</text><text start="810.06" dur="4.2">aren&apos;t really a big fan of the idea of</text><text start="811.74" dur="3.899">global government because it&apos;s not a</text><text start="814.26" dur="3.48">great idea to have unchecked power</text><text start="815.639" dur="4.44">though we don&apos;t have a good history of</text><text start="817.74" dur="6.12">being good stewards of unchecked power</text><text start="820.079" dur="5.88">and so like you know in many modern</text><text start="823.86" dur="3.599">governments in the United States it was</text><text start="825.959" dur="4.261">kind of like the foundation of the whole</text><text start="827.459" dur="4.741">idea was let&apos;s separate church and state</text><text start="830.22" dur="4.32">let&apos;s separate the judicial branch and</text><text start="832.2" dur="4.259">the legislative branch and the executive</text><text start="834.54" dur="3.419">branch let&apos;s even separate the</text><text start="836.459" dur="3.301">legislative branches into separate</text><text start="837.959" dur="3.361">houses let&apos;s select let&apos;s try to create</text><text start="839.76" dur="3.54">as much check and balance on power as</text><text start="841.32" dur="4.139">possible so if you had a one world</text><text start="843.3" dur="3.479">government that had enough power to be</text><text start="845.459" dur="3.601">able to</text><text start="846.779" dur="4.081">price carbon properly and enforce</text><text start="849.06" dur="3.779">fishing laws and Etc</text><text start="850.86" dur="3.779">how do you prevent it from becoming</text><text start="852.839" dur="5.101">corrupted or captured</text><text start="854.639" dur="5.64">and so we need Global government and we</text><text start="857.94" dur="4.56">don&apos;t want Global government and so this</text><text start="860.279" dur="4.201">is this like you you have catastrophes</text><text start="862.5" dur="3.6">on one hand that need to be avoided and</text><text start="864.48" dur="3.419">that typically looks like more control</text><text start="866.1" dur="4.62">mechanisms of things that if you don&apos;t</text><text start="867.899" dur="4.74">control will lead to catastrophe and the</text><text start="870.72" dur="5.34">control mechanisms typically lead to</text><text start="872.639" dur="5.341">dystopias and so we want something that</text><text start="876.06" dur="3.719">is not catastrophes or dystopias we kind</text><text start="877.98" dur="2.94">of call this the third attractor and</text><text start="879.779" dur="3.0">that means you have to have control</text><text start="880.92" dur="3.24">mechanisms that prevent catastrophes but</text><text start="882.779" dur="3.12">you have to have checks and balances on</text><text start="884.16" dur="4.38">The Power Within those how do you do</text><text start="885.899" dur="4.021">that so Global governance and Global</text><text start="888.54" dur="3.299">government men turn on the same thing</text><text start="889.92" dur="3.599">right Global government the idea that</text><text start="891.839" dur="4.44">there&apos;s some centralized Global Monopoly</text><text start="893.519" dur="4.56">of violence the bad idea okay the idea</text><text start="896.279" dur="3.661">that there is some more effective</text><text start="898.079" dur="4.38">process of global coordination even</text><text start="899.94" dur="5.699">whether it&apos;s a more effective process of</text><text start="902.459" dur="5.641">Nations engaging in multilateral</text><text start="905.639" dur="4.861">agreements they can be facilitated by</text><text start="908.1" dur="3.9">technology that can make uh the</text><text start="910.5" dur="3.839">participation or violation of those</text><text start="912.0" dur="5.459">agreements more transparent or you know</text><text start="914.339" dur="5.761">there is some process of global</text><text start="917.459" dur="4.281">governance that has to occur where</text><text start="920.1" dur="4.739">there&apos;s both</text><text start="921.74" dur="5.14">effective power for enforcement this is</text><text start="924.839" dur="3.601">why you know we can solve those types of</text><text start="926.88" dur="3.84">coordination problems to some degree</text><text start="928.44" dur="3.54">those race to the bottom within a</text><text start="930.72" dur="4.559">country where you have a monopoly of</text><text start="931.98" dur="4.68">violence because the law and Monopoly</text><text start="935.279" dur="2.641">violence just basically says no you&apos;re</text><text start="936.66" dur="3.239">not allowed to cut down any of those</text><text start="937.92" dur="3.479">trees that&apos;s a national park and if you</text><text start="939.899" dur="3.18">try the police will stop you and they</text><text start="941.399" dur="4.081">have more capacity for violence than you</text><text start="943.079" dur="3.481">do with international issues where you</text><text start="945.48" dur="3.299">don&apos;t actually have international</text><text start="946.56" dur="4.26">enforcement it&apos;s really really tricky so</text><text start="948.779" dur="3.24">for all of the really Global issues and</text><text start="950.82" dur="3.78">that looks like</text><text start="952.019" dur="4.741">it&apos;s in each nation&apos;s interests to burn</text><text start="954.6" dur="3.9">the coal as fast as it can and the oil</text><text start="956.76" dur="3.3">that&apos;s in each nation&apos;s interest to win</text><text start="958.5" dur="3.12">the AI arms race even though that</text><text start="960.06" dur="2.94">increases the likelihood that we all die</text><text start="961.62" dur="4.86">from it in the long term</text><text start="963.0" dur="6.54">so Global governance that has</text><text start="966.48" dur="5.58">appropriate checks and balances is a</text><text start="969.54" dur="4.62">tricky topic but it&apos;s a necessary topic</text><text start="972.06" dur="4.56">what gives you hope today</text><text start="974.16" dur="5.66">a lot of things can be hope</text><text start="976.62" dur="3.2">I have noticed</text><text start="979.86" dur="5.099">in my own work</text><text start="981.779" dur="5.521">people in</text><text start="984.959" dur="5.101">top positions of power and major</text><text start="987.3" dur="7.14">institutions that affect the world</text><text start="990.06" dur="7.139">being radically more</text><text start="994.44" dur="6.0">aware of things that are fundamentally</text><text start="997.199" dur="6.541">unviable about this world system and</text><text start="1000.44" dur="5.1">interested in deeper changes and</text><text start="1003.74" dur="3.599">actually starting to try to implement</text><text start="1005.54" dur="3.299">some things just even in the last couple</text><text start="1007.339" dur="2.821">years than I had ever experienced</text><text start="1008.839" dur="3.3">previously</text><text start="1010.16" dur="4.979">so the idea that</text><text start="1012.139" dur="5.161">you know the the kind of behavior that</text><text start="1015.139" dur="3.841">individuals can do on their own matters</text><text start="1017.3" dur="4.08">and the kind of stuff we can do locally</text><text start="1018.98" dur="4.28">like you know prototyping new types of</text><text start="1021.38" dur="4.02">communities and new types of cities</text><text start="1023.26" dur="4.72">you don&apos;t</text><text start="1025.4" dur="4.559">solve climate change and time and you</text><text start="1027.98" dur="3.9">don&apos;t solve planetary boundaries in time</text><text start="1029.959" dur="3.96">and you don&apos;t solve AI risk that way</text><text start="1031.88" dur="4.02">right that requires kind of agreement</text><text start="1033.919" dur="4.26">from existing top-down organizations</text><text start="1035.9" dur="4.14">they can&apos;t actually innovate a new

dur="4.5">agreements to innovate a new world</text><text start="1042.919" dur="5.541">actually does require local</text><text start="1045.98" dur="6.72">um and more participatory activity</text><text start="1048.46" dur="6.219">uh but the fact that after covid and</text><text start="1052.7" dur="3.42">after the extreme</text><text start="1054.679" dur="4.38">uh</text><text start="1056.12" dur="6.78">political polarization that uh has</text><text start="1059.059" dur="6.661">happened and after how much of Australia</text><text start="1062.9" dur="5.279">burned and then flooded and</text><text start="1065.72" dur="3.6">um you know now with the war in Ukraine</text><text start="1068.179" dur="2.341">and</text><text start="1069.32" dur="3.5">I think</text><text start="1070.52" dur="4.44">there was a situation where previously</text><text start="1072.82" dur="3.88">people who were thinking about it and</text><text start="1074.96" dur="4.88">who appreciant realized this

that</text><text start="1087.98" dur="5.64">gives me hope</text><text start="1089.24" dur="7.62">great how much time do we have to react</text><text start="1093.62" dur="4.98">to avoid Extinction well

dur="2.761">um</text><text start="1121.4" dur="3.96">you see the</text><text start="1123.32" dur="5.52">pictures of what culture was like in</text><text start="1125.36" dur="5.76">1968 in Iran so it&apos;s not like how long</text><text start="1128.84" dur="5.94">do we have before catastrophe hits we&apos;re</text><text start="1131.12" dur="6.66">already in a rolling Global

dur="3.96">you know and from extreme weather events</text><text start="1142.16" dur="3.379">that are a result of human induced</text><text start="1143.66" dur="4.8">activity poor Environmental

neither of the positions are</text><text start="1382.64" dur="4.26">actually viable and there is something</text><text start="1384.62" dur="4.76">other than truth which is the movement</text><text

start="1396.679" dur="4.38">unmotivated</text><text start="1398.08" dur="6.52">and this is also something I find really</text><text start="1401.059" dur="6.421">interesting is when I talk to

dur="5.16">then autocracy ends up running the world</text><text start="1435.32" dur="6.239">so you&apos;re voting democracy out whatever</text><text start="1437.78" dur="6.12">it is then for so many people the first</text><text start="1441.559" dur="3.661">response when you increase the show them</text><text start="1443.9" dur="2.759">that the way they&apos;re thinking about it</text><text start="1445.22" dur="3.48">doesn&apos;t actually map to the complexity</text><text start="1446.659" dur="3.841">of the problem they go from utter</text><text start="1448.7" dur="3.18">certainty to

start="1455.179" dur="5.281">from certainty to nihilism in one step</text><text start="1457.34" dur="6.54">is so damn lazy like cognitively</text><text start="1460.46" dur="5.579">emotionally

all</text><text start="1467.6" dur="4.5">that well actually climate change or</text><text start="1469.88" dur="4.919">Global Science or policy on this thing</text><text start="1472.1" dur="3.959">is pretty complex there are experts who</text><text start="1474.799" dur="2.88">spend their whole life working on it who</text><text start="1476.059" dur="5.461">disagree that doesn&apos;t mean there

still</text><text start="1502.76" dur="3.6">recognize how much stuff I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1504.679" dur="3.801">that&apos;s relevant and new information that</text><text

at the same</text><text start="1514.22" dur="4.56">time right epistem epistemology meaning</text><text start="1516.98" dur="4.38">how we go about knowing things so I want</text><text start="1518.78" dur="5.34">them to work much harder at trying to</text><text start="1521.36" dur="4.08">come to understand well having much less</text><text start="1524.12" dur="3.36">certainty about their current level of</text><text start="1525.44" dur="3.599">understanding so when you ask how do you</text><text start="1527.48" dur="3.84">like what sources should people go to</text><text start="1529.039" dur="5.581">for news or whatever the ones they don&apos;t</text><text start="1531.32" dur="4.859">currently go to is the first answer</text><text start="1534.62" dur="3.179">um and then of course progressively</text><text start="1536.179" dur="3.721">better sources not all the sources</text><text start="1537.799" dur="5.701">independent of political spinner are</text><text start="1539.9" dur="6.84">equally good but when you can see where</text><text start="1543.5" dur="4.799">do the various Earnest experts on a</text><text start="1546.74" dur="4.2">topic disagree and you at least</text><text start="1548.299" dur="4.62">understand those positions pretty well</text><text start="1550.94" dur="3.119">then you start to have a sense of the</text><text start="1552.919" dur="3.12">topic</text><text start="1554.059" dur="4.5">as a philosopher and because you spoke</text><text start="1556.039" dur="4.5">about political do you want to stay away</text><text start="1558.559" dur="4.521">from politics or</text><text start="1560.539" dur="5.341">are you into politics politics meaning</text><text start="1563.08" dur="5.74">how people organize and how

dur="5.701">education when you&apos;re changing teachers</text><text start="1661.58" dur="4.92">every year I was homeschooled I did go</text><text start="1665.24" dur="3.48">to school</text><text

dur="3.78">parents were kind of interested in</text><text start="1683.0" dur="3.299">running an educational experiment that</text><text start="1685.22" dur="2.699">uh</text><text start="1686.299" dur="3.841">is a little bit closer to what people</text><text start="1687.919" dur="4.441">call unschooling today but there&apos;s just</text><text start="1690.14" dur="4.44">no curriculum it&apos;s just okay</text><text start="1692.36" dur="3.96">um what it felt what they felt you need</text><text start="1694.58" dur="4.8">to to learn it&apos;s not what they felt</text><text start="1696.32" dur="3.839">their hypothesis was</text><text start="1699.38" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="1700.159" dur="5.341">expose the kids to</text><text start="1703.7" dur="3.24">all the different topics see which ones</text><text start="1705.5" dur="4.44">they&apos;re interested in facilitate their</text><text start="1706.94" dur="5.099">interest and kind of trust that and so</text><text

in radical lab no</text><text start="1717.919" dur="7.081">curriculum at all but uh and I&apos;m not</text><text start="1721.52" dur="6.259">saying that is what I would advise but</text><text

start="1732.799" dur="5.341">um</text><text start="1734.539" dur="5.161">most Educational Systems don&apos;t is all of</text><text start="1738.14" dur="5.22">my studies were things I was interested</text><text start="1739.7" dur="5.459">in and so my interest in learning was</text><text start="1743.36" dur="3.78">actually growing all the time right</text><text start="1745.159" dur="3.601">there was never a place where I wanted</text><text start="1747.14" dur="4.62">to get out of school and go play or do</text><text start="1748.76" dur="5.46">something else where uh learning felt</text><text start="1751.76" dur="4.019">like a burden or where I ended up not</text><text start="1754.22" dur="3.18">having any negative association with</text><text start="1755.779" dur="2.76">study right I had only positive</text><text start="1757.4" dur="4.08">association with it because I was</text><text start="1758.539" dur="5.941">studying things I wanted to study so</text><text start="1761.48" dur="5.84">um I find that people tend to become</text><text start="1764.48" dur="5.4">good at things they really enjoy and so</text><text start="1767.32" dur="4.719">facilitating like even if you have a</text><text start="1769.88" dur="3.0">curriculum really paying attention to</text><text start="1772.039" dur="3.061">where</text><text start="1772.88"

appealing to them</text><text start="1779.12" dur="4.02">trying to find a way that actually has</text><text start="1781.58" dur="3.18">it really appeal as a business force</text><text start="1783.14" dur="3.0">them to do the thing makes a huge</text><text start="1784.76" dur="3.0">difference not to their learning of that</text><text start="1786.14" dur="5.159">topic but their relationship to learning</text><text start="1787.76" dur="6.96">itself was a special event that puts you</text><text start="1791.299" dur="5.581">in this path of um trying to</text><text start="1794.72" dur="4.679">see the truth what&apos;s happening and</text><text start="1796.88" dur="5.82">observe the complexity of the world</text><text start="1799.399" dur="5.961">lots and lots of events I mean some some</text><text start="1802.7" dur="2.66">people have</text><text start="1806.12" dur="5.279">a near-death experience turning point</text><text start="1808.52" dur="5.159">that is really kind of

so as I&apos;m mentioning being</text><text start="1817.159" dur="3.181">homeschooled by parents who are</text><text start="1818.6" dur="4.559">obviously kind of</text><text start="1820.34" dur="5.219">interested in childhood development and</text><text start="1823.159" dur="4.02">the books my parents read to me as</text><text start="1825.559" dur="3.661">bedtime stories were

dur="5.1">um you know Eastern Vedic philosophy and</text><text start="1833.779" dur="6.0">things like that so there were</text><text start="1836.899" dur="4.861">um people who are thinking about what is</text><text start="1839.779" dur="3.601">the world how does the world work how do</text><text start="1841.76" dur="4.38">we integrate across the various</text><text start="1843.38"

big part of my study as a</text><text start="1857.6" dur="3.42">kid was not just</text><text start="1859.58" dur="3.24">studying</text><text start="1861.02" dur="3.84">various areas of philosophy or
