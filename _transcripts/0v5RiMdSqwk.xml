something uh</text><text start="151.28" dur="4.959">before covid and we were talking about</text><text start="153.76" dur="3.6">the breakdown incense making that was</text><text start="156.239"

just</text><text start="190.56" dur="3.679">within one air it&apos;s cascading</text><text start="192.8" dur="3.28">and so what i want to talk about here</text><text start="194.239" dur="2.881">today is not just okay there&apos;s all these</text><text start="196.08" dur="3.28">problems</text><text start="197.12" dur="3.52">but why is our assessment of the</text><text start="199.36" dur="3.44">problems</text><text start="200.64" dur="3.599">one of the main causes of the problems</text><text start="202.8" dur="2.56">themselves and the worsening of the</text><text start="204.239" dur="2.961">problems and</text><text start="205.36" dur="2.959">what would it take for us to have a kind</text><text start="207.2" dur="4.319">of shared assessment that makes</text><text

issues facing</text><text start="215.2" dur="2.64">the world today what are the things that</text><text start="216.4" dur="3.68">are both hottest in the news cycle and</text><text start="217.84" dur="3.6">possibly most consequential</text><text start="220.08" dur="2.799">and we start to list them and we say</text><text start="221.44" dur="2.48">which of those is there fairly good</text><text start="222.879" dur="3.681">consensus</text><text start="223.92" dur="4.48">across the space of citizens on it&apos;s</text><text start="226.56" dur="3.599">like almost nothing</text><text start="228.4" dur="4.08">right and not only is there not</text><text start="230.159" dur="3.201">consensus but there is nearly maximum</text><text start="232.48" dur="2.959">polarization</text><text start="233.36" dur="4.56">that is felt to be nearly maximally</text><text start="235.439" dur="4.0">consequential which is a basis for</text><text start="237.92" dur="3.92">not just social tension but a movement</text><text start="239.439" dur="2.401">towards warfare</text><text start="242.319" dur="3.041">if you think about the upcoming u.s</text><text start="243.68" dur="2.88">elections right now i would say that</text><text start="245.36" dur="2.959">we&apos;re in a situation that is</text><text start="246.56" dur="3.36">unprecedented in</text><text start="248.319" dur="2.961">the history of all of our lifetimes and</text><text start="249.92" dur="2.48">pretty much unprecedented in the history</text><text start="251.28" dur="3.44">of the nation</text><text start="252.4" dur="3.92">is everyone has always felt that</text><text start="254.72" dur="2.479">presidential elections are consequential</text><text start="256.32" dur="2.96">maybe they&apos;ve even felt that they&apos;re</text><text start="257.199" dur="4.641">more consequential than they really are</text><text start="259.28" dur="3.52">and they get passionate about it but</text><text start="261.84" dur="2.799">right now</text><text start="262.8" dur="3.52">the percentage of the population that</text><text start="264.639" dur="3.521">thinks that it&apos;s not just consequential</text><text start="266.32" dur="3.84">this election but is existential to the</text><text start="268.16" dur="4.0">republic itself</text><text start="270.16" dur="3.52">is very high like it&apos;s a very high</text><text start="272.16" dur="1.92">percentage of the population that think</text><text start="273.68" dur="4.239">the</text><text start="274.08" dur="5.76">way this election goes will be either</text><text start="277.919" dur="4.161">the end of the nation or the possibility</text><text start="279.84" dur="4.4">of it to continue on both sides</text><text start="282.08" dur="3.6">right so like to really get a sense the</text><text start="284.24" dur="3.6">trump supporters feel that trump is the</text><text start="285.68" dur="3.519">only thing standing between</text><text start="287.84" dur="2.96">the republic being protected and the</text><text start="289.199" dur="3.601">people being protected at all and a kind</text><text start="290.8" dur="5.44">of globalist deep state cabal taking</text><text start="292.8" dur="5.44">everything over in a finalizing way and</text><text start="296.24" dur="3.92">running the benign china hypothesis like</text><text start="298.24" dur="3.679">they did in dc since the 70s and</text><text start="300.16" dur="2.479">basically ceding control of the world to</text><text start="301.919" dur="2.801">china</text><text start="302.639" dur="4.161">that kind of thing the the never</text><text start="304.72" dur="4.479">trumpers think that if trump gets in</text><text start="306.8" dur="4.239">he will eviscerate the last elements of</text><text start="309.199" dur="3.601">a republican created a dynasty</text><text start="311.039" dur="3.681">kind of for his family and chosen people</text><text start="312.8" dur="3.28">to run it like they both think that it&apos;s</text><text start="314.72" dur="2.479">the end of the republic if the other guy</text><text start="316.08" dur="2.64">gets in</text><text start="317.199" dur="3.44">and they both think the other side is</text><text start="318.72" dur="3.12">going to steal it they&apos;re set up</text><text start="320.639" dur="2.321">to actually think that there isn&apos;t</text><text start="321.84" dur="2.72">election security it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="322.96" dur="2.799">stolen so what happens when the election</text><text start="324.56" dur="4.639">comes</text><text start="325.759" dur="5.121">and it&apos;s not held as valid and it&apos;s held</text><text start="329.199" dur="3.521">as existential and we have these</text><text start="330.88" dur="3.92">mounting tensions</text><text start="332.72" dur="3.68">already that were there with kovid</text><text start="334.8" dur="3.36">because of lockdown lockdown means more</text><text start="336.4" dur="4.96">news cycle to take all the stuff in</text><text start="338.16" dur="5.84">right and</text><text start="341.36" dur="3.839">then also it means radically increasing</text><text start="344.0" dur="3.68">unemployment</text><text start="345.199" dur="3.84">and we so when we saw the violence start</text><text start="347.68" dur="3.04">with george floyd</text><text start="349.039" dur="4.16">violence was actually bound to start</text><text start="350.72" dur="6.72">from some trigger</text><text start="353.199" dur="4.241">when you study kind of the societal</text><text start="357.919" dur="4.081">chaos indices the things that would</text><text start="360.0" dur="3.759">create a basis for societal chaos</text><text start="362.0" dur="3.6">the more people whose fundamental needs</text><text start="363.759" dur="3.361">aren&apos;t met by a system they become more</text><text start="365.6" dur="2.64">desperately willing to act against the</text><text start="367.12" dur="3.199">system</text><text start="368.24" dur="4.239">and so when you start having massive</text><text start="370.319" dur="4.481">unemployment that&apos;s a very unstable</text><text start="372.479" dur="3.921">situation for the overall system and</text><text start="374.8" dur="3.76">it&apos;s going to express itself somehow</text><text start="376.4" dur="3.6">and no one really has the ability to</text><text start="378.56" dur="4.88">process any of this</text><text start="380.0" dur="5.44">well nor are the nor is the reporting</text><text start="383.44" dur="3.44">oriented to try to process it in an</text><text start="385.44" dur="2.479">adequate way which is actually a really</text><text start="386.88" dur="3.12">hard thing to do</text><text start="387.919" dur="4.801">there&apos;s much higher incentive to control</text><text start="390.0" dur="4.319">a narrative for particular purposes</text><text start="392.72" dur="3.44">and so for the most part people have</text><text start="394.319" dur="3.121">kind of traded epistemology for</text><text start="396.16" dur="3.28">tribalism</text><text start="397.44" dur="4.4">meaning given up on trying to do a</text><text start="399.44" dur="4.72">rigorous job of making sense of things</text><text start="401.84" dur="3.359">themselves like take a narrative take a</text><text start="404.16" dur="3.039">q anon narrative</text><text start="405.199" dur="4.0">take a antifa narrative break it into</text><text start="407.199" dur="3.28">individual propositions</text><text start="409.199" dur="4.0">and then look at each of those</text><text start="410.479" dur="4.641">propositions what evidence do i have to</text><text start="413.199" dur="3.761">verify it or falsify it</text><text start="415.12" dur="4.079">maybe neither do i have any evidence</text><text start="416.96" dur="3.84">that would at least support or refute it</text><text start="419.199" dur="3.28">do other people interpret that evidence</text><text start="420.8" dur="2.799">differently go across the whole thing</text><text start="422.479" dur="3.28">then look at</text><text start="423.599" dur="4.081">alternate hypotheses nobody does that</text><text start="425.759" dur="4.72">right like very very few people</text><text start="427.68" dur="3.919">use formal epistemic process so what</text><text start="430.479" dur="3.521">they&apos;re really doing</text><text start="431.599" dur="4.16">is paying attention to what feels true</text><text start="434.0" dur="2.08">which largely has to do with what people</text><text start="435.759" dur="2.241">like</text><text start="436.08" dur="3.36">me kind of seem to think and which

have been here for a long time</text><text start="450.639" dur="3.68">but the thing that we call civilization</text><text start="452.4" dur="4.639">which was much larger than tribal</text><text

larger scale</text><text start="460.4" dur="5.04">coordination</text><text start="462.639" dur="4.321">a tiny percentage of the people that</text><text start="465.44" dur="3.759">ever lived lived in something like a</text><text start="466.96" dur="5.519">republic or democracy</text><text start="469.199" dur="4.961">they almost all lived in a feudalism or</text><text start="472.479" dur="4.801">monarchy or some kind</text><text start="474.16" dur="4.56">of much more top-down autocratic system</text><text start="477.28" dur="3.759">which is actually quite easy to</text><text

actually a wild</text><text start="484.8" dur="2.64">proposition</text><text start="485.759" dur="2.88">which is that a huge number of people</text><text start="487.44" dur="2.72">who don&apos;t know

start="895.44" dur="3.36">eating all the time the moment they stop</text><text start="896.959" dur="3.761">it starts breaking down because it&apos;s</text><text start="898.8" dur="3.92">it&apos;s actually very expensive well it&apos;s</text><text start="900.72" dur="3.2">actually very expensive to keep a whole</text><text start="902.72" dur="3.679">population</text><text start="903.92"

dur="3.04">emotionally compels me ends up winning</text><text start="1391.52" dur="2.96">rather than better product and service</text><text start="1392.88" dur="2.56">so the system starts to

dur="3.039">mechanisms and we can kind of define all</text><text start="1436.08" dur="2.719">those differently but market type</text><text start="1437.279" dur="5.121">mechanisms mean</text><text start="1438.799" dur="4.801">um some kind of distributed bottom-up</text><text start="1442.4" dur="3.44">type system where the</text><text start="1443.6" dur="3.76">agreement happens point-to-point not as</text><text start="1445.84" dur="3.76">a systemic agreement across the whole</text><text start="1447.36" dur="5.76">space and the topology is emergent</text><text start="1449.6" dur="5.84">and whether it is a formal religious</text><text start="1453.12" dur="4.48">organization or a state or some kind of</text><text start="1455.44" dur="4.4">commons agreement</text><text start="1457.6" dur="4.16">then you have the government type</text><text start="1459.84" dur="3.76">mechanisms that have some top-down</text><text start="1461.76" dur="2.96">collective agreement type structure</text><text start="1463.6" dur="2.079">those are kind of different</text><text start="1464.72" dur="3.439">architectures</text><text start="1465.679" dur="4.161">but then you have like culture and by</text><text start="1468.159" dur="2.961">culture here because that word means</text><text start="1469.84" dur="2.88">different things in different places i</text><text start="1471.12" dur="5.28">mean what are the</text><text start="1472.72" dur="5.6">collective values that people hold</text><text start="1476.4" dur="3.2">and the collective worldview and ways of</text><text start="1478.32" dur="5.28">making sense</text><text start="1479.6" dur="7.6">that would determine say in a government</text><text start="1483.6" dur="5.52">what laws should be made right because</text><text start="1487.2" dur="3.68">law is really a codification of an</text><text start="1489.12" dur="4.08">ethical system</text><text start="1490.88" dur="3.84">ethics is then not part of the market or</text><text start="1493.2" dur="3.52">part of the state formally but</text><text start="1494.72" dur="3.6">is supposed to be guiding and binding</text><text start="1496.72" dur="3.04">them and so</text><text start="1498.32" dur="4.4">we can think of that as kind of like a</text><text start="1499.76" dur="4.24">culture and so if you think about those</text><text start="1502.72" dur="2.8">three and how they&apos;re supposed to</text><text start="1504.0" dur="3.6">interact</text><text start="1505.52" dur="4.48">in the idea of like our current system a</text><text start="1507.6" dur="6.72">liberal democracy of some sort</text><text start="1510.0" dur="6.159">roughly is that most of the innovation</text><text start="1514.32" dur="3.28">will happen

for</text><text start="1537.279" dur="4.081">is that markets will have a market for</text><text start="1539.679" dur="4.48">human trafficking</text><text start="1541.36" dur="4.16">or for organ

people</text><text start="1555.76" dur="3.2">bad for others and so we say okay</text><text start="1557.52" dur="2.8">there are some things market does</text><text start="1558.96" dur="2.0">innovation and production well but it</text><text start="1560.32" dur="2.16">also does</text><text start="1560.96" dur="3.04">extraction and kind of pathological</text><text start="1562.48" dur="3.28">stuff so we want to bind</text><text start="1564.0" dur="4.0">the predatory aspects of market well how</text><text start="1565.76" dur="3.519">do we do that well we&apos;ll make a state</text><text

free speech and the right had more</text><text start="3029.68" dur="3.28">desire to control certain things that</text><text start="3031.119" dur="3.361">they thought were communist or

dur="4.48">emotionally charged short salacious</text><text start="3264.8" dur="4.4">vehement things trending</text><text start="3266.96" dur="4.0">and to understand any of these things</text><text start="3269.2" dur="3.28">well they&apos;re complex enough that they</text><text start="3270.96" dur="2.56">need to be long and complex and kind of</text><text start="3272.48" dur="5.52">boring

doesn&apos;t just</text><text start="3292.24" dur="5.359">allow them to broadcast but will amplify</text><text start="3295.839" dur="3.28">well so now we can say should the issue</text><text start="3297.599" dur="3.681">be freedom of speech or the regular</text><text start="3299.119" dur="3.281">regulation of those platforms now we</text><text start="3301.28" dur="2.72">start to get to the right level of</text><text start="3302.4" dur="3.12">granularity where we&apos;re realizing you</text><text start="3304.0" dur="3.76">can&apos;t think of freedom of speech</text><text start="3305.52" dur="5.599">independent of the media environment in</text><text start="3307.76" dur="5.2">which the things are being upregulated</text><text start="3311.119" dur="3.44">so then we say well should we actually</text><text start="3312.96" dur="3.599">regulate freedom of speech</text><text start="3314.559" dur="3.04">we&apos;ve always thought that it was okay to</text><text start="3316.559" dur="3.121">have something like an</text><text start="3317.599" dur="4.161">ftc or an sec that says you&apos;re not</text><text start="3319.68" dur="4.159">allowed to lie about your finances</text><text start="3321.76" dur="3.92">in this public filing or in this</text><text start="3323.839" dur="3.52">marketing so we were okay with</text><text start="3325.68" dur="3.76">regulation online</text><text start="3327.359" dur="4.081">but then as we trust the government less</text><text start="3329.44" dur="3.76">the question is who is adjudicating what</text><text start="3331.44" dur="4.32">is a lie</text><text start="3333.2" dur="4.56">and so in a situation right now where</text><text start="3335.76" dur="3.12">nobody really trusts at least half of</text><text start="3337.76" dur="3.359">the government</text><text start="3338.88" dur="3.679">or the other kinds of institutions</text><text start="3341.119" dur="3.121">nobody would trust</text><text start="3342.559" dur="3.201">who&apos;s going to say what fake news is</text><text start="3344.24" dur="2.879">because the left says the rights news is</text><text start="3345.76" dur="2.24">fake and the right says the left&apos;s news</text><text start="3347.119" dur="2.161">is fake and everyone</text><text start="3348.0" dur="3.119">says that the institutions that the</text><text start="3349.28" dur="2.72">other guy follows are are the corrupted</text><text start="3351.119" dur="2.72">ones</text><text start="3352.0" dur="4.88">so then the question of well who gets to</text><text start="3353.839" dur="4.321">adjudicate what is true</text><text start="3356.88" dur="2.959">well that becomes the most powerful</text><text start="3358.16" dur="3.52">force in the world and then all the most</text><text start="3359.839" dur="3.601">powerful forces have maximum incentive</text><text start="3361.68" dur="2.879">to become that and to capture it using</text><text start="3363.44" dur="4.159">all of the</text><text start="3364.559" dur="5.441">um covert influence and whatever tools</text><text start="3367.599" dur="6.401">that they could possibly have to do that</text><text start="3370.0" dur="6.0">so the the ins the easy sensor answers</text><text start="3374.0" dur="3.68">and the easy just keep total free speech</text><text start="3376.0" dur="2.559">within this context answers are both</text><text start="3377.68" dur="2.159">silly</text><text start="3378.559" dur="3.28">right the issue is actually pretty</text><text start="3379.839" dur="3.28">complex in order to be able to</text><text start="3381.839" dur="2.96">adjudicate we need</text><text start="3383.119" dur="3.2">to trust the adjudication process well</text><text start="3384.799" dur="4.0">that&apos;s again like a state regulating a</text><text start="3386.319" dur="4.48">market here it&apos;s a market of ideas</text><text start="3388.799" dur="3.76">and it&apos;s a state that would maybe like</text><text start="3390.799" dur="3.04">whether it&apos;s an sec or an ftc that would</text><text start="3392.559" dur="2.641">be able to regulate but you need a</text><text start="3393.839" dur="3.28">people who can regulate to make sure</text><text start="3395.2" dur="3.919">this is actually true and honest and</text><text start="3397.119" dur="3.521">doing an effective thing so again the</text><text start="3399.119" dur="2.081">basis of the answer is actually again</text><text start="3400.64" dur="2.56">they call</text><text start="3401.2" dur="3.919">a collective enlightenment that has</text><text start="3403.2" dur="3.68">people who can sense make well enough</text><text start="3405.119" dur="2.881">to be able to say

that i care</text><text start="3413.44" dur="5.2">about this issue so much and</text><text start="3415.52" dur="6.24">am sensitized to it is</text><text start="3418.64" dur="6.0">i have

start="3899.28" dur="3.759">like if you&apos;ll notice that the stuff</text><text start="3901.119" dur="3.361">that feels so obviously true to you</text><text start="3903.039" dur="2.721">feels

that&apos;s not</text><text start="3912.72" dur="3.119">communicating</text><text start="3914.0" dur="3.28">that&apos;s just doubling down on groupthink</text><text start="3915.839" dur="3.361">and tribalism</text><text start="3917.28" dur="4.24">and so but it&apos;s interesting to see why</text><text start="3919.2" dur="2.32">is it that</text><text start="3921.68" dur="4.159">and good to certain people and feels</text><text start="3923.92" dur="4.32">just like</text><text start="3925.839" dur="3.121">stupid and evil to other people why does</text><text start="3928.24" dur="2.319">it feel</text><text start="3928.96" dur="3.28">that different way well if i pay</text><text start="3930.559" dur="2.961">attention to the media environment that</text><text start="3932.24" dur="4.24">they&apos;re taking in</text><text start="3933.52" dur="5.039">feels true is largely resonant with what</text><text start="3936.48" dur="5.28">they&apos;ve taken in so far</text><text start="3938.559" dur="6.081">right like that&apos;s a big part of it so um</text><text start="3941.76" dur="3.2">one of the things that i do on an issue</text><text start="3944.64" dur="4.719">is</text><text start="3944.96" dur="7.28">let&apos;s say i want to make sense of</text><text start="3949.359" dur="4.24">police violence in the u.s or i want to</text><text start="3952.24" dur="3.28">make sense of</text><text start="3953.599" dur="4.161">the beirut blast or the india china</text><text start="3955.52" dur="4.16">border or whatever it is</text><text start="3957.76" dur="3.359">as far as narratives go there&apos;s not one</text><text start="3959.68" dur="3.6">narrative there&apos;s usually</text><text start="3961.119" dur="3.761">there&apos;s usually not even two narratives</text><text start="3963.28" dur="3.44">there might be five</text><text start="3964.88" dur="3.04">or seven or eleven different kind of</text><text start="3966.72" dur="2.079">narrative clusters there might be a</text><text start="3967.92" dur="2.639">hundred</text><text start="3968.799" dur="3.601">versions but they fall within general</text><text start="3970.559" dur="3.361">clusters</text><text start="3972.4" dur="3.12">and so what i&apos;ll usually try to do is do</text><text start="3973.92" dur="3.439">a landscape of what the narrative</text><text start="3975.52" dur="5.12">clusters are first</text><text start="3977.359" dur="4.161">and then i&apos;ll try to steal man each</text><text start="3980.64" dur="3.919">narrative</text><text start="3981.52" dur="4.319">like what is the strongest version of</text><text start="3984.559" dur="2.881">arguing that thing</text><text start="3985.839" dur="2.641">that i&apos;ve been able to see so look for</text><text start="3987.44" dur="3.599">the best thinkers that are</text><text start="3988.48" dur="4.879">representative of those narratives</text><text start="3991.039" dur="4.0">that&apos;s helpful for me to both see the</text><text start="3993.359" dur="2.96">signal that they got because that</text><text start="3995.039" dur="3.201">the collective intelligence of those</text><text start="3996.319" dur="3.681">people doesn&apos;t have no signal</text><text start="3998.24" dur="3.04">it also helps me understand why they</text><text start="4000.0" dur="3.039">think what they think which also helps</text><text start="4001.28" dur="4.88">me understand how to maybe communicate</text><text start="4003.039" dur="4.721">and relate but that doesn&apos;t mean that i</text><text start="4006.16" dur="4.08">agree with all of it it means that i&apos;m</text><text start="4007.76" dur="4.16">seeking to understand it right</text><text start="4010.24" dur="3.52">so then the next thing i want to do is</text><text start="4011.92" dur="3.439">after i&apos;ve done that which is a kind of</text><text start="4013.76" dur="3.68">interpersonal intelligence</text><text start="4015.359" dur="3.521">seeking to understand the narrative then</text><text start="4017.44" dur="3.04">i want to do a kind of empirical or</text><text start="4018.88" dur="3.28">objective intelligence</text><text start="4020.48" dur="3.2">and break the narrative into individual</text><text start="4022.16" dur="3.52">propositions</text><text start="4023.68" dur="3.28">and typically even framed in the</text><text start="4025.68" dur="2.48">question are assumptions and</text><text start="4026.96" dur="3.28">presuppositions that are actually</text><text start="4028.16" dur="3.04">propositions so use propositional logic</text><text start="4030.24" dur="2.4">and break it into individual</text><text start="4031.2" dur="3.2">propositions and i say</text><text start="4032.64" dur="3.439">what evidence have they put forward to</text><text start="4034.4" dur="4.0">support each of these propositions and</text><text start="4036.079" dur="5.441">typically it&apos;s like</text><text start="4038.4" dur="5.199">i&apos;ll break a complex narrative into like</text><text start="4041.52" dur="3.68">50 propositions and there&apos;s maybe</text><text start="4043.599" dur="3.44">evidence for like four of them</text><text start="4045.2" dur="3.44">and it&apos;s usually like maybe strong</text><text start="4047.039" dur="3.361">evidence for two and kind of weak for</text><text start="4048.64" dur="4.399">four and then a bunch of just</text><text start="4050.4" dur="3.439">emotional leaps logical leaps so then</text><text start="4053.039" dur="2.8">i&apos;ll say what</text><text start="4053.839" dur="3.441">additional evidence can i get that will</text><text start="4055.839" dur="5.76">either</text><text start="4057.28" dur="6.319">verify or falsify or at least support or</text><text start="4061.599" dur="3.2">decrease the likelihood for any of these</text><text start="4063.599" dur="2.881">and where are there ones that i can</text><text start="4064.799" dur="2.721">neither verify nor falsify and should</text><text start="4066.48" dur="3.92">just sit as</text><text start="4067.52" dur="5.2">this is just a filler someone put in but</text><text start="4070.4" dur="3.6">i have no basis for certainty whatsoever</text><text start="4072.72" dur="2.72">i have to be comfortable with</text><text start="4074.0" dur="2.799">uncertainty to be able to make sense of</text><text start="4075.44" dur="2.72">it or i will try to jump to false</text><text start="4076.799" dur="3.361">certainties</text><text start="4078.16" dur="4.24">then i have to not only seek to verify</text><text start="4080.16" dur="3.76">and falsify each of those parts</text><text start="4082.4" dur="3.12">because most likely there&apos;s a few true</text><text start="4083.92" dur="2.399">parts a few nonsense parts and a bunch</text><text start="4085.52" dur="2.799">of filler</text><text start="4086.319" dur="3.52">right and that&apos;s true across the whole</text><text start="4088.319" dur="2.72">narrative space so then i also have to</text><text start="4089.839" dur="2.321">seek to do this across the other</text><text start="4091.039" dur="4.401">narratives</text><text start="4092.16" dur="7.36">so this is important because</text><text start="4095.44" dur="6.879">most people are jumping to what is true</text><text start="4099.52" dur="4.48">very much not through a epistemic or</text><text start="4102.319" dur="3.84">logical process even if they think</text><text start="4104.0" dur="3.6">it is what they if they really break it</text><text start="4106.159" dur="2.401">down propositionally they&apos;ll find that</text><text start="4107.6" dur="2.719">they had a</text><text start="4108.56" dur="3.599">logical process of this seems true and</text><text start="4110.319" dur="2.641">this seems true therefore and therefore</text><text start="4112.159" dur="4.56">has like eight</text><text start="4112.96" dur="5.92">logical leaps in it um</text><text start="4116.719" dur="3.361">so basically these are a few steps that</text><text start="4118.88" dur="4.399">i would encourage</text><text start="4120.08" dur="3.52">for people on their own to be dubious of</text><text start="4123.279" dur="3.601">their</text><text start="4123.6" dur="5.52">own certainty and</text><text start="4126.88" dur="4.2">outrage to seek to understand the</text><text start="4129.12" dur="3.92">narrative landscape better to seek</text><text start="4131.08" dur="5.8">empiricism better to</text><text start="4133.04" dur="6.0">try to be able to not reject or</text><text start="4136.88" dur="3.919">take entire narratives but be able to</text><text start="4139.04" dur="3.6">look for partial truths</text><text start="4140.799" dur="3.201">to be able to try to aggregate signal</text><text start="4142.64" dur="2.88">across the space</text><text start="4144.0" dur="3.679">to be way more comfortable with</text><text start="4145.52" dur="2.88">uncertainty and that&apos;s uncomfortable in</text><text start="4147.679" dur="2.401">a way to say</text><text start="4148.4" dur="3.439">i don&apos;t understand the world i live in</text><text start="4150.08" dur="3.279">even in the most consequential areas i</text><text start="4151.839" dur="3.681">just don&apos;t understand it</text><text start="4153.359" dur="3.44">at least that i actually feel safer</text><text start="4155.52" dur="3.279">because i know that i don&apos;t have</text><text start="4156.799" dur="2.721">confirmation bias making me understand</text><text start="4158.799" dur="2.721">it wrongly</text><text start="4159.52" dur="3.12">i at least have a chance to increase my</text><text start="4161.52" dur="2.799">understanding</text><text start="4162.64" dur="3.679">when i say i don&apos;t know because the</text><text start="4164.319" dur="3.681">moment i think that i falsely know</text><text start="4166.319" dur="4.641">now i&apos;m not even going to be able to</text><text start="4168.0" dur="5.679">learn well right</text><text start="4170.96" dur="4.879">so these are some examples of things and</text><text start="4173.679" dur="2.16">then</text><text start="4176.08" dur="5.44">in addition to reading across the space</text><text start="4178.799" dur="5.601">actually seek the more</text><text start="4181.52" dur="5.44">um well-grounded and complex views as</text><text start="4184.4" dur="6.16">opposed to the more trending ones</text><text start="4186.96" dur="5.04">uh i want to find the thinkers that seem</text><text start="4190.56" dur="3.679">most

dur="3.2">want to see where people who have deep</text><text start="4197.52" dur="3.44">expertise and earnestness</text><text start="4199.12" dur="4.48">disagree and then i want to explore

thinking</text><text start="4260.64" dur="3.2">that we were doing something like</text><text start="4262.159" dur="3.121">the kind of intelligence and research</text><text start="4263.84" dur="4.16">work to be able to understand the</text><text start="4265.28" dur="4.32">escalation pathways to catastrophic risk</text><text start="4268.0" dur="3.28">so we were working on getting a

just at a</text><text start="4279.52" dur="2.8">theoretical level but having to get a</text><text start="4280.8" dur="2.64">lot of detailed info about what&apos;s really</text><text start="4282.32" dur="3.2">going on on the ground</text><text start="4283.44" dur="4.4">to know where the actual escalation</text><text start="4285.52" dur="5.28">pathways and those types of things are</text><text start="4287.84" dur="3.76">as we were and that was to inform</text><text start="4290.8" dur="2.32">strategic</text><text start="4291.6" dur="4.079">kinds of interventions that could really</text><text

dur="4.56">people in</text><text start="4305.52" dur="5.84">in high level public and private</text><text start="4309.44" dur="3.12">influence positions and prepare</text><text start="4311.36"

start="4346.4" dur="4.799">designed for</text><text start="4347.52" dur="5.36">and so you would have cdc looking at</text><text start="4351.199" dur="3.121">you know disease type risks and these</text><text start="4352.88" dur="2.96">kind of military groups looking at these</text><text start="4354.32" dur="3.12">kinds of</text><text start="4355.84" dur="3.52">terrorism risks and these

dur="3.28">and start to cascade across them</text><text start="4362.8" dur="4.48">and so looking at the interconnection of</text><text start="4364.4" dur="5.68">them is actually critical to

start="4405.12" dur="2.64">is a fundamentally anti-democratic idea</text><text start="4407.199" dur="2.721">right a</text><text start="4407.76" dur="4.16">democratic idea would be everyone can</text><text start="4409.92" dur="2.64">possibly be a significant decision maker</text><text start="4411.92" dur="4.239">hopefully</text><text start="4412.56" dur="7.76">is actually more involved

dur="3.52">choices</text><text start="4423.679" dur="5.04">is the information processing not the</text><text start="4426.48" dur="4.32">information access this is a key thing</text><text

start="4433.92" dur="4.16">access to more total information than</text><text start="4435.76" dur="4.479">the president had 20 years ago and so</text><text start="4438.08" dur="3.76">we&apos;ve democratized information access</text><text start="4440.239" dur="3.681">this is kind of a gibberish story</text><text start="4441.84" dur="3.839">because even though in one way it&apos;s true</text><text start="4443.92" dur="3.12">i can&apos;t read the billion search results</text><text start="4445.679" dur="3.281">on anything and i don&apos;t know where the</text><text

not access to information it&apos;s</text><text start="4453.28" dur="4.32">access to information processing</text><text start="4455.679" dur="3.281">to inform actionable intel that is</text><text start="4457.6" dur="3.76">really relevant and there&apos;s an</text><text start="4458.96" dur="3.279">unbelievable asymmetry of that if you</text><text start="4461.36" dur="3.92">look at the top</text><text start="4462.239" dur="4.401">kind of trading funds algorithmic</text><text start="4465.28" dur="1.919">trading funds and you look at the kind</text><text start="4466.64" dur="3.92">of</text><text start="4467.199" dur="5.04">financial market intel in information</text><text start="4470.56" dur="3.04">processing not just information access</text><text start="4472.239" dur="3.041">yes they have information access you</text><text start="4473.6" dur="3.36">don&apos;t have of lots of different kinds of</text><text start="4475.28" dur="2.48">things behind pay walls and

dur="3.12">talking about like 10 orders of</text><text start="4498.96" dur="2.56">magnitude information processing</text><text start="4500.48" dur="3.36">difference</text><text start="4501.52" dur="3.199">and the same is true when it comes to</text><text start="4503.84" dur="2.399">you know</text><text start="4504.719" dur="3.041">all different aspects of power and</text><text start="4506.239" dur="4.881">intelligence</text><text start="4507.76" dur="5.04">so to really be able to support a</text><text start="4511.12" dur="3.28">an emergence of something like a</text><text start="4512.8" dur="4.16">democratic process participatory</text><text start="4514.4" dur="4.64">governance the information</text><text start="4516.96" dur="3.6">access and information processing to

looks</text><text start="4523.28" dur="4.399">like is prerequisite</text><text start="4524.8" dur="3.68">and so we started thinking well can we</text><text start="4527.679" dur="4.0">can we make</text><text start="4528.48" dur="5.28">things like this as the news and</text><text start="4531.679" dur="3.841">at the same time one of the risks that</text><text start="4533.76" dur="3.439">we were seeing that was driving all of</text><text start="4535.52" dur="2.96">the other catastrophic risks the fastest</text><text start="4537.199" dur="3.841">was the news landscape</text><text start="4538.48" dur="3.6">and i don&apos;t just mean the few large news</text><text start="4541.04" dur="2.8">channels i mean</text><text start="4542.08" dur="3.28">the media landscape that is the facebook</text><text start="4543.84" dur="3.76">issues we were talking about</text><text start="4545.36" dur="3.2">and you know all the youtube</text><text start="4547.6" dur="2.639">recommendation</text><text start="4548.56" dur="4.639">algorithms plus the nature of the news</text><text start="4550.239" dur="4.96">and all like that and we&apos;re seeing that</text><text start="4553.199" dur="5.201">you know people being willing to go up</text><text start="4555.199" dur="3.201">in arms over</text><text start="4558.64" dur="4.0">uh mass squaring or shutdown or</text><text start="4560.76" dur="4.04">hydroxychloroquine or</text><text start="4562.64" dur="3.36">systemic race issues mostly are from</text><text start="4564.8" dur="2.399">things they

dur="3.039">the nature of what was happening in the</text><text start="4570.8" dur="3.76">media space</text><text start="4572.159" dur="4.641">was actually driving the breakdown of</text><text start="4574.56" dur="3.36">society faster than anything else was</text><text start="4576.8" dur="3.359">because in the movement from</text><text start="4577.92" dur="4.4">conventional unconventional

start="4587.84" dur="4.399">kinetic warfare guns and stuff</text><text start="4589.92" dur="3.84">but the front of it where the fastest</text><text start="4592.239" dur="3.281">rate of change is occurring</text><text start="4593.76" dur="4.16">is the narrative in info warfare that is</text><text start="4595.52" dur="4.8">being fought in people&apos;s minds for</text><text start="4597.92" dur="7.6">people&apos;s minds right for</text><text start="4600.32" dur="8.32">the the control of population</text><text start="4605.52" dur="5.6">and so if we could do something to</text><text

dur="4.881">possibility of engagement with it</text><text start="4635.44" dur="4.0">and then if you can start having even a</text><text start="4637.6" dur="2.8">small group of people who are

dur="2.32">uh</text><text start="4702.159" dur="4.08">and so if you for most people they would</text><text start="4705.52" dur="4.0">actually</text><text start="4706.239" dur="4.881">be best supported

did we read</text><text start="4869.52" dur="2.719">and look at</text><text start="4870.4" dur="4.0">what data sets did we include what data</text><text start="4872.239" dur="3.761">sets did we say we

dur="3.76">epistemic frames did we use</text><text start="4879.92" dur="3.52">and so if someone wants to see that they</text><text start="4881.52" dur="3.6">can so now this is them also

it of course we also</text><text start="4906.719" dur="4.48">uh want to show retrospectives of where</text><text start="4909.52" dur="3.199">we made forecasts or said</text><text start="4911.199" dur="3.201">what was going on where we later found</text><text start="4912.719" dur="3.121">out that we were wrong or right or we</text><text start="4914.4" dur="2.88">get to show here&apos;s where we

dur="4.64">our models so really good transparency</text><text start="4920.96" dur="4.16">and earnestness in that whole process</text><text start="4923.52" dur="3.28">also so you can do the kind of under the</text><text start="4925.12" dur="2.0">hood thing you can also do the meta news</text><text start="4926.8" dur="2.56">thing</text><text start="4927.12" dur="4.4">the meta news is okay so here&apos;s what we</text><text start="4929.36" dur="3.52">were able to find out about this topic</text><text start="4931.52" dur="2.8">but that sounds different than what you</text><text start="4932.88" dur="3.6">read in the new york times or the</text><text start="4934.32" dur="3.68">atlantic or breitbart or mother jones or</text><text start="4936.48" dur="2.64">rt or whatever other place you&apos;re</text><text start="4938.0" dur="3.199">looking at</text><text start="4939.12" dur="3.36">why what do they say why do they say</text><text start="4941.199" dur="2.561">that why did we come up with something</text><text start="4942.48" dur="2.64">different what is our assessment of what</text><text start="4943.76" dur="3.36">they came up with</text><text start="4945.12" dur="3.84">so this is actually and of course we&apos;re</text><text start="4947.12" dur="3.92">not going to be able to do that for all</text><text start="4948.96" dur="4.16">news sources right we we&apos;ve already</text><text start="4951.04" dur="3.36">looked at about 1500 new sources in our</text><text start="4953.12" dur="2.96">curation process we kind of have to</text><text start="4954.4" dur="3.6">collapse those to ones that cluster</text><text start="4956.08" dur="3.04">in a similar type of narrative and then</text><text start="4958.0" dur="2.639">pick you know some of the better</text><text start="4959.12" dur="3.76">exemplars of those</text><text start="4960.639" dur="3.52">and say okay so here&apos;s the narrative</text><text start="4962.88" dur="2.799">landscape</text><text start="4964.159" dur="3.601">we&apos;ll go ahead and steel man that</text><text start="4965.679" dur="3.601">narrative landscape and then we will</text><text start="4967.76" dur="3.36">break it down</text><text start="4969.28" dur="4.24">into individual propositions and say</text><text start="4971.12" dur="4.96">what can we verify what can we falsify</text><text start="4973.52" dur="4.56">so we are helping people to understand</text><text start="4976.08" dur="4.159">the world through more of the lenses</text><text start="4978.08" dur="3.84">understand why people other people think</text><text start="4980.239" dur="2.4">what they think even have a clear sense</text><text start="4981.92" dur="3.279">of it</text><text start="4982.639" dur="3.361">then also understand how to empirically</text><text start="4985.199" dur="3.281">validate</text><text start="4986.0" dur="4.56">these things then we also show the</text><text start="4988.48" dur="4.08">narrative and info weapons so we&apos;ll say</text><text start="4990.56" dur="4.079">okay so in this piece here</text><text start="4992.56" dur="3.44">here&apos;s the original piece of science</text><text start="4994.639" dur="1.921">that they were quoting or the original</text><text start="4996.0" dur="2.4">video</text><text start="4996.56" dur="3.36">or that they were referencing but then</text><text start="4998.4" dur="3.759">here&apos;s the way they framed it this is</text><text start="4999.92" dur="4.4">lakehoff framing this is a kind of spin</text><text start="5002.159" dur="4.161">now that same thing is has spin on it</text><text start="5004.32" dur="3.76">over here that&apos;s of a different type so</text><text start="5006.32" dur="3.2">let&apos;s explain the concept of lakehoff</text><text start="5008.08" dur="4.0">framing and spin</text><text start="5009.52" dur="5.119">and or russell conjugation or those</text><text start="5012.08" dur="4.96">kinds of narrative weapons and say</text><text start="5014.639" dur="3.761">look for these everywhere right and this</text><text start="5017.04" dur="2.639">isn&apos;t the left saying the right</text><text start="5018.4" dur="2.88">snooze is fake or the right saying the</text><text start="5019.679" dur="3.601">left news is fake this is saying</text><text start="5021.28" dur="4.959">everyone who&apos;s playing the narrative</text><text start="5023.28" dur="4.24">game is subject to some of the same</text><text start="5026.239" dur="2.801">pressures</text><text start="5027.52" dur="3.36">and these are some of the tools that get</text><text start="5029.04" dur="4.24">used so look for them</text><text start="5030.88" dur="3.2">and also there&apos;s some signal in all of</text><text start="5033.28" dur="3.04">these places</text><text start="5034.08" dur="3.36">so we&apos;re not coming out as the this is</text><text start="5036.32" dur="2.96">fake news but</text><text start="5037.44" dur="3.92">there is some signal let&apos;s try to verify</text><text start="5039.28" dur="4.0">it and there is some distortion</text><text start="5041.36" dur="3.6">so the goal in the meta news is that</text><text start="5043.28" dur="2.72">someone doesn&apos;t hear what we say and say</text><text start="5044.96" dur="2.48">okay well that&apos;s just one other</text><text start="5046.0" dur="2.719">narrative with lots of narratives they</text><text start="5047.44" dur="2.64">actually get to see all the narratives</text><text start="5048.719" dur="2.161">and they get to see how we&apos;re making</text><text start="5050.08" dur="2.32">sense of them</text><text start="5050.88" dur="3.44">and they get to also apply their own</text><text start="5052.4" dur="4.799">capacity to make sense of them</text><text start="5054.32" dur="4.96">and we make explicit the narrative and</text><text start="5057.199" dur="4.241">info weapons</text><text start="5059.28" dur="3.6">so that people can recognize them more</text><text start="5061.44" dur="5.279">on their own</text><text start="5062.88" dur="5.44">and by also by reifying the true parts</text><text start="5066.719" dur="3.361">and being able to say where something is</text><text start="5068.32" dur="3.919">either clearly falsifiable or we just</text><text start="5070.08" dur="5.44">can neither verify nor falsify it&apos;s just</text><text start="5072.239" dur="4.721">conjecture or spin we hopefully help</text><text start="5075.52" dur="4.56">people neither just</text><text start="5076.96" dur="5.759">accept nor reject any standard narrative</text><text start="5080.08" dur="4.85">but be able to take a more rigorous and</text><text start="5082.719" dur="5.761">nuanced view across all of them</text><text start="5084.93" dur="5.789">[Music]</text><text start="5088.48" dur="3.759">then of course there&apos;s places where to</text><text start="5090.719" dur="4.321">understand what&apos;s going on</text><text start="5092.239" dur="4.96">there&apos;s education that people need for</text><text start="5095.04"

dur="3.52">across</text><text start="5267.44" dur="5.199">multiple disciplines because if i want</text><text start="5270.4" dur="4.88">to understand almost any of these issues</text><text

there&apos;s</text><text start="5284.56" dur="4.32">quite a lot of environmental psychology</text><text start="5287.6" dur="3.36">or infrastructure there&apos;s</text><text start="5288.88" dur="3.6">a lot of different specialty domains</text><text start="5290.96" dur="3.199">that need to be</text><text start="5292.48" dur="3.52">factored so there&apos;s a lot of narratives</text><text start="5294.159" dur="3.921">and a lot of epistemologies</text><text start="5296.0" dur="3.76">so we&apos;re looking for people internally</text><text start="5298.08" dur="4.159">who can do</text><text start="5299.76" dur="4.08">uh interdisciplinary and trans-narrative</text><text start="5302.239" dur="3.601">thinking so then of course people who</text><text start="5303.84" dur="3.2">are specialists or do hold a particular</text><text start="5305.84" dur="2.799">ideology can give</text><text start="5307.04" dur="3.52">input but we can take the input across</text><text start="5308.639" dur="5.6">those spaces and try to do</text><text start="5310.56" dur="5.44">analysis and then synthesis on it</text><text start="5314.239" dur="3.041">the decentralized sense making is</text><text start="5316.0" dur="5.28">something that we want to</text><text start="5317.28" dur="8.0">experiment with we&apos;re actually um</text><text start="5321.28" dur="6.16">yeah looking at being able to uh</text><text start="5325.28" dur="3.68">crowdsource different projects and be</text><text start="5327.44" dur="2.96">able to help up regulate some of the</text><text start="5328.96" dur="2.96">right ones and</text><text start="5330.4" dur="3.52">you know even where you have articles</text><text start="5331.92" dur="4.08">that have forums</text><text start="5333.92" dur="3.6">can we experiment with architectures in</text><text start="5336.0" dur="3.04">the forum that incent</text><text start="5337.52" dur="2.96">both higher quality sentence making and</text><text start="5339.04" dur="3.44">higher quality conversation where those</text><text start="5340.48" dur="5.44">are the things that get up regulated</text><text start="5342.48" dur="4.88">um i think we can and we have a number</text><text start="5345.92" dur="3.04">of kind of ideas on how to make</text><text start="5347.36" dur="3.2">architectures that really incent that</text><text start="5348.96" dur="4.32">social architectures built in the</text><text start="5350.56" dur="6.24">digital space</text><text start="5353.28" dur="5.2">and so the hope here is that let&apos;s say</text><text

that</text><text start="5362.639" dur="5.52">really has the high epistemic drive and</text><text start="5365.12" dur="4.72">capacity to sense make very well</text><text start="5368.159" dur="3.761">well even if it&apos;s a small percentage of</text><text start="5369.84" dur="3.839">the total audience</text><text start="5371.92" dur="3.44">some of those people are in everybody&apos;s</text><text start="5373.679" dur="3.361">friend group almost everybody&apos;s friend</text><text start="5375.36" dur="2.72">group almost every major facebook group</text><text start="5377.04" dur="2.8">or social network</text><text start="5378.08" dur="3.92">if those people have really good data</text><text start="5379.84" dur="4.399">sources much better epistemology things</text><text start="5382.0" dur="4.239">that are addressing well</text><text start="5384.239" dur="4.0">all of the sides of various things and</text><text start="5386.239" dur="3.44">they&apos;re learning how to do dialectic and</text><text start="5388.239" dur="2.881">steel manning well they can start to</text><text start="5389.679" dur="3.281">influence the spaces they&apos;re in to be</text><text start="5391.12" dur="3.68">able to do better sense making</text><text start="5392.96" dur="3.279">often times the people who have best</text><text start="5394.8" dur="2.96">sense making are also employed by the</text><text start="5396.239" dur="3.281">people who are in top institutional</text><text start="5397.76" dur="2.72">positions of power as strategists
