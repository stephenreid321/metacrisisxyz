here</text><text start="7.44" dur="4.38">and you know I think most of us have</text><text start="9.599" dur="4.2">been following your work for a long time</text><text start="11.82" dur="4.559">and we're really looking forward to</text><text start="13.799" dur="4.56">sharing some time and discussing</text><text start="16.379" dur="5.06">what we've learned and what we could</text><text start="18.359" dur="6.061">take away from this now with you because</text><text start="21.439" dur="5.381">we've more or less to build on the</text><text start="24.42" dur="4.5">conversation that I hope everybody has</text><text start="26.82" dur="7.32">had a chance to look at you've had with</text><text start="28.92" dur="10.38">livebury around meditations on moloch we</text><text start="34.14" dur="8.22">have understood that there are</text><text start="39.3" dur="4.98">downward spiral negative Dynamics</text><text start="42.36" dur="5.46">merging from</text><text start="44.28" dur="6.24">Malik emerging from what's probably in</text><text start="47.82" dur="4.919">your words very close to the reason for</text><text start="50.52" dur="6.84">all of the issues we're having to deal</text><text start="52.739" dur="7.921">with which is our idea of money over</text><text start="57.36" dur="5.699">money return of trying to optimize</text><text start="60.66" dur="5.88">towards Financial profits</text><text start="63.059" dur="6.6">but with all understood that</text><text start="66.54" dur="4.74">and but now we're faced specifically</text><text start="69.659" dur="4.381">because we're coming to the end of this</text><text start="71.28" dur="4.92">series with the question of okay what</text><text start="74.04" dur="5.28">are we going to do with this how are we</text><text start="76.2" dur="5.58">going to carry this forward into our</text><text start="79.32" dur="5.1">everyday lives into our realities in</text><text start="81.78" dur="5.479">which we have to deal with the pressures</text><text start="84.42" dur="6.36">of</text><text start="87.259" dur="5.201">managing money or simply explaining to</text><text start="90.78" dur="3.78">others how we think about the world</text><text start="92.46" dur="4.979">right this is difficult this is really</text><text start="94.56" dur="5.879">difficult and so this is this one Avenue</text><text start="97.439" dur="5.161">that we'd like to explore how can we</text><text start="100.439" dur="5.281">maintain this for ourselves how can we</text><text start="102.6" dur="5.94">deepen this how can we not let this slip</text><text start="105.72" dur="4.32">after we've embarked on this journey</text><text start="108.54" dur="4.759">together here</text><text start="110.04" dur="6.539">and maybe we can also touch on</text><text start="113.299" dur="5.081">some ideas of how to</text><text start="116.579" dur="3.0">put this into action in the world</text><text start="118.38" dur="2.16">concrete ways of putting this</text><text start="119.579" dur="3.661">interaction</text><text start="120.54" dur="4.14">which is difficult which is because you</text><text start="123.24" dur="3.239">have to make some very clear and</text><text start="124.68" dur="4.98">probably uncomfortable decisions but I</text><text start="126.479" dur="4.2">don't want to give your talk Daniel so</text><text start="129.66" dur="3.6">I'm gonna</text><text start="130.679" dur="4.741">give you some space to unfold some of</text><text start="133.26" dur="4.38">your ideas around this like we exchanged</text><text start="135.42" dur="5.1">earlier</text><text start="137.64" dur="6.92">and and then we</text><text start="140.52" dur="4.04">open a conversation and have some fun</text><text start="144.959" dur="3.181">Daniel</text><text start="146.22" dur="3.96">do you feel something coming up that you</text><text start="148.14" dur="4.4">would like to pick up on and we take it</text><text start="150.18" dur="2.36">from there</text><text start="154.08" dur="5.1">you said that people here had watched</text><text start="156.72" dur="6.06">some part of that talk that I gave with</text><text start="159.18" dur="5.339">Liv Ori and obviously went through this</text><text start="162.78" dur="3.539">whole Gita series and heard a lot of</text><text start="164.519" dur="3.421">things and you mentioned that many of</text><text start="166.319" dur="3.121">the people here are familiar with things</text><text start="167.94" dur="4.62">that I say that I don't care to repeat</text><text start="169.44" dur="5.22">previously so I guess I'm if this is</text><text start="172.56" dur="3.36">especially the last of the series and</text><text start="174.66" dur="2.88">hopefully people take something</text><text start="175.92" dur="3.599">meaningful way I want to share what is</text><text start="177.54" dur="2.94">most useful so I guess I'm curious to</text><text start="179.519" dur="3.601">hear</text><text start="180.48" dur="5.16">what is top of mind for people and maybe</text><text start="183.12" dur="6.8">speak into that</text><text start="185.64" dur="4.28">okay let's begin let's open with that</text><text start="191.34" dur="5.7">if you all reflect and I see I think</text><text start="194.7" dur="3.0">Patrick you might have now Patrick still</text><text start="197.04" dur="3.3">music</text><text start="197.7" dur="5.039">if you all reflect on what happened</text><text start="200.34" dur="4.259">during this series and as some of our</text><text start="202.739" dur="4.741">since making conversations in between</text><text start="204.599" dur="6.78">the sessions with our guests</text><text start="207.48" dur="5.82">and you map that onto the</text><text start="211.379" dur="3.901">rest of your life as you were going</text><text start="213.3" dur="3.6">through the series</text><text start="215.28" dur="3.42">what's</text><text start="216.9" dur="3.96">comes up for you</text><text start="218.7" dur="3.899">is it something you'd like to share</text><text start="220.86" dur="3.98">as a foundation for this conversation</text><text start="222.599" dur="2.241">today</text><text start="226.5" dur="7.26">Lucille good so maybe one thing that is</text><text start="231.54" dur="5.279">I think Thomas mentioned it already but</text><text start="233.76" dur="6.8">to me as a person who sits on the</text><text start="236.819" dur="7.741">crossroad between capital and Technology</text><text start="240.56" dur="6.22">knowing what we know now and also based</text><text start="244.56" dur="5.16">on this series</text><text start="246.78" dur="5.28">it would be very beneficial to</text><text start="249.72" dur="4.14">understand not only what is our next</text><text start="252.06" dur="3.3">step as individuals because I think</text><text start="253.86" dur="3.9">we'll each take it to</text><text start="255.36" dur="4.499">our own lives and implement it in</text><text start="257.76" dur="4.52">different ways</text><text start="259.859" dur="5.4">but what is it that we can do</text><text start="262.28" dur="6.22">individually or collectively</text><text start="265.259" dur="8.22">to take a step in the direction that</text><text start="268.5" dur="6.84">will better us and all everyone</text><text start="273.479" dur="4.44">maybe that's</text><text start="275.34" dur="5.4">yeah 30 000 feet but this is really</text><text start="277.919" dur="6.021">where I'm struggling to really put some</text><text start="280.74" dur="3.2">concretization into it</text><text start="286.5" dur="5.04">you feel like and yeah</text><text start="288.54" dur="4.68">conversation so far with everyone who</text><text start="291.54" dur="4.86">spoke on Gita series</text><text start="293.22" dur="5.1">you have a different view about what the</text><text start="296.4" dur="3.78">intersection of capital and technology</text><text start="298.32" dur="4.159">portends for the future on the current</text><text start="300.18" dur="2.299">track</text><text start="303.84" dur="4.98">I feel like we have to build two</text><text start="305.94" dur="4.62">parallel worlds where the current track</text><text start="308.82" dur="3.599">somehow needs to be tweaked and</text><text start="310.56" dur="3.9">continued but the new track needs to</text><text start="312.419" dur="4.201">come about and and work in parallel I</text><text start="314.46" dur="5.88">don't think we can switch</text><text start="316.62" dur="5.82">and it's about how we treat capital or</text><text start="320.34" dur="5.28">what we think about it in terms of being</text><text start="322.44" dur="4.979">a resource or whatever like anything</text><text start="325.62" dur="5.579">else</text><text start="327.419" dur="5.941">and and what we can</text><text start="331.199" dur="4.681">direct people who are technology people</text><text start="333.36" dur="6.0">or people who think around the</text><text start="335.88" dur="6.12">philosophy of Technology maybe of what</text><text start="339.36" dur="4.2">should be done in order to address these</text><text start="342.0" dur="3.9">challenges that were raised here about</text><text start="343.56" dur="5.82">the energy and the minerals and</text><text start="345.9" dur="5.0">resources and yeah I think that's a bit</text><text start="349.38" dur="5.759">what I feel like it's a parallel</text><text start="350.9" dur="7.18">situation which can take a long time or</text><text start="355.139" dur="4.261">a short time but somehow needs to start</text><text start="358.08" dur="3.98">happening or maybe it is happening</text><text start="359.4" dur="5.16">already and I'm just late in the game</text><text start="362.06" dur="4.12">so the big question that you're asking I</text><text start="364.56" dur="3.54">think is the question of this call which</text><text start="366.18" dur="3.6">is what can we tangibly do individually</text><text start="368.1" dur="3.78">and collectively towards all that needs</text><text start="369.78" dur="5.4">done as people who are sitting in the</text><text start="371.88" dur="5.52">place of investment technology</text><text start="375.18" dur="4.56">what can be done that moves the current</text><text start="377.4" dur="5.1">system in a better Direction at minimum</text><text start="379.74" dur="4.38">not in a worse Direction and is there</text><text start="382.5" dur="3.3">stuff that can be done with capital that</text><text start="384.12" dur="3.96">helps develop new systems that are more</text><text start="385.8" dur="4.2">fundamentally adequate hopefully we'll</text><text start="388.08" dur="3.78">unpack that over the course but you said</text><text start="390.0" dur="5.16">a couple things that were just little</text><text start="391.86" dur="4.92">tangents I wanted to speak to First</text><text start="395.16" dur="3.479">you mentioned what can we do with</text><text start="396.78" dur="2.639">capital that is a resource like any</text><text start="398.639" dur="1.861">other</text><text start="399.419" dur="4.201">I</text><text start="400.5" dur="5.1">this may be obvious to everybody but if</text><text start="403.62" dur="3.6">not it's really worth saying I would not</text><text start="405.6" dur="3.36">say that capital</text><text start="407.22" dur="4.14">meaning fiscal Capital the way we think</text><text start="408.96" dur="5.179">of it is a resource like any other</text><text start="411.36" dur="5.7">I think it is a</text><text start="414.139" dur="4.9">optionality token for all forms of</text><text start="417.06" dur="6.419">extractable and exchangeable resource</text><text start="419.039" dur="6.901">without actually being a resource itself</text><text start="423.479" dur="4.261">I think it is a technology it's a social</text><text start="425.94" dur="3.599">technology that is arguably the most</text><text start="427.74" dur="3.12">powerful technology Humanities ever</text><text start="429.539" dur="3.78">created</text><text start="430.86" dur="5.3">and that it is fundamentally both</text><text start="433.319" dur="5.16">constructive and destructive but more</text><text start="436.16" dur="4.36">importantly destructive</text><text start="438.479" dur="4.201">for this phase</text><text start="440.52" dur="3.899">and that's not based on how we use it</text><text start="442.68" dur="3.419">it's intrinsic to the nature of the</text><text start="444.419" dur="2.641">technology itself no matter how we use</text><text start="446.099" dur="4.921">it</text><text start="447.06" dur="6.06">and it's just if this is not understood</text><text start="451.02" dur="6.239">there's like nothing that can be done</text><text start="453.12" dur="8.6">so just indulge me a moment on it</text><text start="457.259" dur="4.461">first the concept of resource</text><text start="463.74" dur="6.0">I had a</text><text start="465.96" dur="7.44">feature of anthropology that would have</text><text start="469.74" dur="6.54">been like 110 now when I was young he</text><text start="473.4" dur="4.199">was very old and he had the fortune of</text><text start="476.28" dur="4.56">getting to be</text><text start="477.599" dur="4.861">the first Western person to contact many</text><text start="480.84" dur="3.299">indigenous tribes or one of the first</text><text start="482.46" dur="3.66">that were still separate from Western</text><text start="484.139" dur="3.361">civilization and modern civilization</text><text start="486.12" dur="5.28">writ large</text><text start="487.5" dur="6.72">and he was doing cultural analysis on</text><text start="491.4" dur="4.739">seeing how much the current modern</text><text start="494.22" dur="3.419">society model had become ubiquitous</text><text start="496.139" dur="3.18">conditioning in all of our studies of</text><text start="497.639" dur="3.0">human nature were inside of ubiquitous</text><text start="499.319" dur="2.761">conditioning so you can't really call it</text><text start="500.639" dur="2.701">nature and so he wanted to see the</text><text start="502.08" dur="2.399">things that hadn't been conditioned in</text><text start="503.34" dur="2.88">that way and if human nature actually</text><text start="504.479" dur="3.66">expressed differently</text><text start="506.22" dur="4.02">so he was looking at the most violent</text><text start="508.139" dur="3.96">and least violent cultures and looking</text><text start="510.24" dur="3.659">at what they are that's a function of</text><text start="512.099" dur="2.82">and one of the key things was looking at</text><text start="513.899" dur="2.88">how it was a function of language</text><text start="514.919" dur="4.321">actually had a couple teachers that had</text><text start="516.779" dur="4.5">looked at this deeply one of the most</text><text start="519.24" dur="4.919">profound insights was</text><text start="521.279" dur="4.921">they said that in some of the island</text><text start="524.159" dur="4.68">Polynesian cultures and some of the</text><text start="526.2" dur="5.16">Amazonian cultures that were still that</text><text start="528.839" dur="4.081">were extremely non-violent both in inter</text><text start="531.36" dur="3.659">and intra-tribe</text><text start="532.92" dur="4.14">they didn't have the word mine in their</text><text start="535.019" dur="3.781">language first person possessive just</text><text start="537.06" dur="4.26">wasn't even a word</text><text start="538.8" dur="4.68">and in other ones they had the word but</text><text start="541.32" dur="4.199">it was extremely de-emphasized it was</text><text start="543.48" dur="3.359">like a strange word to refer to a bad</text><text start="545.519" dur="2.641">idea</text><text start="546.839" dur="5.041">and</text><text start="548.16" dur="6.06">they had ours but even ours possession</text><text start="551.88" dur="4.26">didn't mean the same thing it had the</text><text start="554.22" dur="3.42">concept of stewardship built into the</text><text start="556.14" dur="3.3">semantic itself</text><text start="557.64" dur="4.199">and mine is actually one of the first</text><text start="559.44" dur="4.019">words that most kids in our culture</text><text start="561.839" dur="3.12">learn</text><text start="563.459" dur="3.301">and</text><text start="564.959" dur="3.841">one of the things that they found was</text><text start="566.76" dur="5.28">that the cultures that didn't have the</text><text start="568.8" dur="5.36">word mine also didn't have the word or</text><text start="572.04" dur="5.16">the prevalence of the words greed</text><text start="574.16" dur="5.26">selfish or jealousy</text><text start="577.2" dur="4.139">because those were not just innate human</text><text start="579.42" dur="4.8">emotions that are always there they were</text><text start="581.339" dur="4.861">actually memetic constructs if you have</text><text start="584.22" dur="3.179">a shared ownership situation in a tribe</text><text start="586.2" dur="3.3">but it's not ownership because you don't</text><text start="587.399" dur="3.961">have massive Surplus so you don't have</text><text start="589.5" dur="4.56">radical wealth inequality everybody</text><text start="591.36" dur="5.099">shares stuff whoever goes fishing that's</text><text start="594.06" dur="3.36">for everybody whoever is picking berries</text><text start="596.459" dur="2.82">is</text><text start="597.42" dur="5.28">you just don't build those same</text><text start="599.279" dur="5.401">constructs in in terms of I want what</text><text start="602.7" dur="4.44">they have it just doesn't occur in the</text><text start="604.68" dur="4.98">same way so there are so many constructs</text><text start="607.14" dur="3.96">that we have that we take for granted as</text><text start="609.66" dur="3.119">just human nature that we have to work</text><text start="611.1" dur="4.14">with that are actually at the foundation</text><text start="612.779" dur="4.62">of our problems so I mentioned that</text><text start="615.24" dur="4.02">because the word resource is an</text><text start="617.399" dur="3.301">inherently violent word</text><text start="619.26" dur="3.0">the way we think of it the way we've</text><text start="620.7" dur="4.02">defined it</text><text start="622.26" dur="4.38">Human Resources is how do we see</text><text start="624.72" dur="3.78">sentient human beings</text><text start="626.64" dur="3.48">who are Somebody's Baby who are going to</text><text start="628.5" dur="3.0">be on their deathbed reflecting upon</text><text start="630.12" dur="3.24">their purpose in life and if they use</text><text start="631.5" dur="3.42">their time how do we see them as a</text><text start="633.36" dur="3.419">resource for a company that has a</text><text start="634.92" dur="3.539">fiduciary responsibility to profit</text><text start="636.779" dur="3.361">maximize</text><text start="638.459" dur="3.241">they're not human resources</text><text start="640.14" dur="4.319">they're human beings</text><text start="641.7" dur="4.98">and talk about natural resources is a</text><text start="644.459" dur="3.901">whale a natural resource</text><text start="646.68" dur="2.76">because it is if you're running a</text><text start="648.36" dur="4.14">whaling boat a whale's a natural</text><text start="649.44" dur="5.1">resource is it any sentient animal is an</text><text start="652.5" dur="4.14">ecosystem that you that we devastate a</text><text start="654.54" dur="3.96">natural resource black people used to be</text><text start="656.64" dur="4.199">natural resources</text><text start="658.5" dur="5.22">meaning part of the chattel the same way</text><text start="660.839" dur="5.041">we treat cows so the word and concept</text><text start="663.72" dur="4.619">resource has to go like it just</text><text start="665.88" dur="4.62">fundamentally the idea man's dominion</text><text start="668.339" dur="4.56">over everything is here for us if we can</text><text start="670.5" dur="4.2">control it and extract it it's about its</text><text start="672.899" dur="4.261">utility value rather than intrinsic</text><text start="674.7" dur="4.74">value for us at the heart of the ideas</text><text start="677.16" dur="4.02">that has to go is that</text><text start="679.44" dur="3.6">so I want to

dur="5.22">what's that</text><text start="2137.8" dur="5.7">oh maybe somebody should mute so I want</text><text start="2140.68" dur="4.86">to change the market parity where the</text><text

dur="6.299">the non-profit I do some lobbying to</text><text start="2178.72" dur="5.76">change the subsidies I also do some</text><text start="2182.859" dur="3.301">activist stuff that makes it to

dur="3.599">now money wants to divest from it</text><text start="2199.54" dur="3.66">naturally if I simultaneously took</text><text start="2201.339" dur="3.421">something below Market parity the
