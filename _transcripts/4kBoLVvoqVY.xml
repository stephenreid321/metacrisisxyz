dur="6.02">stage the Delta is a little bit wide I</text><text start="44.7" dur="2.6">must confess</text><text start="47.52" dur="5.16">amazing to have everyone here listening</text><text start="50.1" dur="6.06">into these very deep complex difficult</text><text start="52.68" dur="6.32">discussions my name is Nicholas</text><text start="56.16" dur="5.82">and I was very lucky with my company</text><text start="59.0" dur="7.0">kilona with the timing it's a buy now</text><text start="61.98" dur="6.54">pay later for e-commerce and thanks to</text><text start="66.0" dur="4.439">this

dur="4.979">life which was to be financially</text><text start="82.32" dur="6.36">independent I could change my fake Rolex</text><text start="85.439" dur="6.781">into a real one I mean how great isn't</text><text start="88.68" dur="5.52">that but as everyone understand I mean a</text><text start="92.22" dur="4.02">fake Rolex showed the same time as a</text><text start="94.2" dur="3.959">real one and looks exactly the same and</text><text start="96.24" dur="4.08">I could only eat five times per day and</text><text start="98.159" dur="3.42">so once nothing's changed I thought I</text><text start="100.32" dur="4.68">would reaching everyone now but I just</text><text start="101.579" dur="3.72">felt complete emptiness</text><text start="105.0" dur="1.14">[Music]</text><text start="105.299" dur="3.601">um</text><text start="106.14" dur="5.64">this made me reflect it made me reflect</text><text start="108.9" dur="4.98">on what we celebrate in society and in</text><text start="111.78" dur="4.92">my vertical of startups we celebrate</text><text start="113.88" dur="4.379">unicorns the companies that reach a</text><text start="116.7" dur="5.279">certain valuation a billion

or idea behind</text><text start="139.92" dur="5.34">North Korean Foundation instead</text><text start="142.92" dur="4.679">put the spotlight and capital and</text><text start="145.26"

and I was</text><text start="293.82" dur="3.42">listening to Nate and Olivia and Kate</text><text start="295.56" dur="3.3">today and</text><text start="297.24" dur="3.959">um</text><text start="298.86" dur="5.76">you know these are people whose work I</text><text start="301.199" dur="5.461">respect deeply and who are saying some</text><text start="304.62" dur="6.06">of the most important things that can be</text><text start="306.66" dur="7.2">said and are brilliant educators</text><text start="310.68" dur="5.959">and I was feeling</text><text start="313.86" dur="2.779">uh</text><text start="317.639" dur="3.84">I was feeling the sense of the</text><text start="320.04" dur="4.02">recognition that it probably doesn't</text><text start="321.479" dur="6.0">matter at all</text><text start="324.06" dur="5.16">that most everybody will leave and</text><text start="327.479" dur="3.66">probably continue working the jobs that</text><text start="329.22" dur="3.419">they work doing mostly the same types of</text><text start="331.139" dur="4.021">things</text><text start="332.639" dur="5.101">and they will remember what happened</text><text start="335.16" dur="3.96">like okay we're destroying the</text><text start="337.74" dur="2.82">atmosphere we're boiling the oceans</text><text start="339.12" dur="2.88">we're killing all the other species</text><text start="340.56" dur="5.4">we're doing it</text><text start="342.0" dur="6.12">at the cost of colonialism we're on the</text><text start="345.96" dur="4.56">way towards Extinction</text><text start="348.12" dur="4.62">and that will last in people's minds</text><text start="350.52" dur="4.56">till they scroll for a minute</text><text start="352.74" dur="5.16">until a bunch of messages come in and</text><text start="355.08" dur="7.16">until the bills need paid at most</text><text start="357.9" dur="4.34">and I'm thinking about</text><text start="362.639" dur="4.861">the talks that boehm and krishnamarti</text><text start="365.28" dur="4.32">gave in the 80s saying very similar</text><text start="367.5" dur="4.8">things about civilization being on a</text><text start="369.6" dur="4.319">self-destruct path or that Bucky gave it</text><text start="372.3" dur="3.6">after World War II</text><text start="373.919" dur="3.72">and the people who listened earnestly</text><text start="375.9" dur="5.46">and everything they were saying has come</text><text start="377.639" dur="5.34">to pass and those curves keep doing the</text><text start="381.36" dur="5.399">same thing</text><text start="382.979" dur="5.581">and I'm I was thinking about the</text><text start="386.759" dur="4.201">Nuremberg trials</text><text start="388.56" dur="5.28">where after World War II when the Nazis</text><text start="390.96" dur="5.459">were being tried for war crimes</text><text start="393.84" dur="4.079">uh one of the things they were asked was</text><text start="396.419" dur="2.701">if they believed in everything they were</text><text start="397.919" dur="4.021">doing</text><text start="399.12" dur="5.34">and something like 90 percent of them</text><text start="401.94" dur="5.94">said No at first they believed the kind</text><text start="404.46" dur="5.519">of propaganda of uh the Jewish attack on</text><text start="407.88" dur="5.4">their population and whatever but as it</text><text start="409.979" dur="5.94">got into gassing children</text><text start="413.28" dur="4.38">uh something like 90 of the people who</text><text start="415.919" dur="2.821">were doing that said no I totally didn't</text><text start="417.66" dur="2.819">believe in it and I thought it was</text><text start="418.74" dur="4.14">terrible and then when they were asked</text><text start="420.479" dur="4.56">did you try to stop they all said no and</text><text start="422.88" dur="4.74">they quoted German phrases that</text><text start="425.039" dur="4.861">translated to something like officers</text><text start="427.62" dur="5.519">orders I didn't have a choice</text><text start="429.9" dur="4.919">and I think about</text><text start="433.139" dur="4.261">I think about all the things that we</text><text start="434.819" dur="5.761">would consider impact like it was just</text><text start="437.4" dur="6.18">normal life in Tibet before Mao invaded</text><text start="440.58" dur="6.0">when we talk about having a civilization</text><text start="443.58" dur="5.76">that has deeper consideration for other</text><text start="446.58" dur="5.58">sentient beings and deeper interiority</text><text start="449.34" dur="4.44">and Tibet was pretty great at that and</text><text start="452.16" dur="3.84">it didn't lead</text><text start="453.78" dur="4.44">it didn't lead to their civilization</text><text start="456.0" dur="5.819">continuing when a more power-oriented</text><text start="458.22" dur="6.0">civilization wanted to end it uh I think</text><text start="461.819" dur="4.921">about when we're talking about the</text><text start="464.22" dur="4.379">the impending catastrophes I think about</text><text start="466.74" dur="4.679">the 100 million Native Americans that</text><text start="468.599" dur="5.04">were genocided for my country to exist</text><text start="471.419" dur="4.741">just a minute ago</text><text start="473.639" dur="4.68">and we like to have we talk about like</text><text start="476.16" dur="4.56">the values of Western Civilization but</text><text start="478.319" dur="4.741">you know modern democracy in the United</text><text start="480.72" dur="4.8">States occurred on 100 million person</text><text start="483.06" dur="4.079">genocide and massive slavery</text><text start="485.52" dur="5.16">as well as the destruction of the</text><text start="487.139" dur="5.581">species and and that genocide was in</text><text start="490.68" dur="3.66">this part of the exponential curve that</text><text start="492.72" dur="3.599">is now verticalizing and people don't</text><text start="494.34" dur="3.84">have an intuition for how fast it goes</text><text start="496.319" dur="3.421">from here</text><text start="498.18" dur="2.94">and I'm thinking about all of the</text><text start="499.74" dur="4.859">Chinese soldiers who are going into</text><text start="501.12" dur="4.979">Tibet murdering nuns and Priests and</text><text start="504.599" dur="3.301">destroying that culture and that</text><text start="506.099" dur="3.361">similarly they were mostly people who</text><text start="507.9" dur="4.499">loved their kids and were moral people</text><text start="509.46" dur="6.42">before being called into that situation</text><text start="512.399" dur="6.361">and so I'm thinking about</text><text start="515.88" dur="5.399">when I when I was reflecting like</text><text start="518.76" dur="5.1">what does it take for any of this</text><text start="521.279" dur="4.741">knowledge to matter</text><text start="523.86" dur="4.14">I don't know about the other speakers I</text><text start="526.02" dur="4.499">hate public speaking you were mentioning</text><text start="528.0" dur="4.62">the fear of it like this is a miserable</text><text start="530.519" dur="4.741">um experience for me</text><text start="532.62" dur="6.06">I feel an obligation</text><text start="535.26" dur="5.759">to have more people</text><text start="538.68" dur="4.32">understand more of the situation they</text><text start="541.019" dur="4.641">find themselves in and hopefully care</text><text start="543.0" dur="2.66">more deeply</text><text start="547.68" dur="4.62">one last thing and then we'll go back to</text><text start="549.72" dur="5.52">your questions I was I was on a call</text><text start="552.3" dur="5.7">with a friend the other day</text><text start="555.24" dur="5.64">who has done very successful work in</text><text start="558.0" dur="5.94">public health globally and it's a good</text><text start="560.88" dur="5.519">guy is a good guy who is used to working</text><text start="563.94" dur="4.32">on how to make the world better through</text><text start="566.399" dur="4.5">institutional means the United Nations</text><text start="568.26" dur="4.139">and things like that and he engaged on</text><text start="570.899" dur="3.601">some projects that we were working on</text><text start="572.399" dur="4.141">regarding artificial intelligence risks</text><text start="574.5" dur="3.839">and synthetic biology risks which are</text><text start="576.54" dur="3.299">not obvious on the map shared earlier</text><text start="578.339" dur="3.841">the map shared earlier we're talking</text><text start="579.839" dur="3.961">about largely the effective industrial</text><text start="582.18" dur="4.98">era Tech</text><text start="583.8" dur="5.42">on planetary

radically faster right when</text><text start="594.66" dur="4.859">you look at the</text><text start="596.16" dur="6.359">speed at which GPT got used by a hundred</text><text start="599.519" dur="5.221">million users or threads than in five</text><text start="602.519" dur="4.44">days getting used by 100 million users</text><text start="604.74" dur="4.56">compared to how quick it took the steam</text><text start="606.959" dur="6.601">engine to be used by that many people</text><text start="609.3" dur="6.18">but also the impact of it and</text><text start="613.56" dur="3.48">just briefly in case people don't know</text><text start="615.48" dur="4.5">because this will add something to the</text><text start="617.04" dur="4.62">metichrys to the thesis of what's been</text><text

which</text><text start="626.04" dur="3.78">um is really good I'm very happy about</text><text start="627.72" dur="3.48">the poly crisis becoming more aware so</text><text start="629.82"

dur="3.18">social justice or whatever one issue</text><text start="637.32" dur="3.66">they were coming from but recognizing</text><text start="638.82" dur="4.079">there are many different critical

from one to the other and they</text><text start="645.899" dur="4.321">need considered together which is</text><text start="647.339" dur="5.461">unbelievably important the we more talk</text><text start="650.22" dur="4.799">about the meta crisis which is just</text><text start="652.8" dur="4.5">a slight distinction in terms of the</text><text start="655.019" dur="5.221">it's not just there's a lot of different</text><text start="657.3" dur="4.8">crises and that they're moving towards</text><text start="660.24" dur="3.839">Global catastrophic risks but that they</text><text start="662.1" dur="3.96">have underlying dynamics that give rise</text><text start="664.079" dur="4.38">to them that have to be addressed</text><text start="666.06" dur="4.38">um but one of the other distinctions

um</text><text start="684.899" dur="4.56">uh Max tegmark our Swede so everybody</text><text start="687.42" dur="5.46">here is probably actually fairly aware</text><text start="689.459" dur="4.62">of

dur="5.759">and that kind of thing but you know when</text><text start="1272.72" dur="4.86">we look at the history of warfare</text><text start="1275.419" dur="5.041">we didn't have the ability and War to</text><text start="1277.58" dur="6.24">destroy everything until World War II</text><text start="1280.46" dur="6.32">and World War II was a minute ago in</text><text start="1283.82" dur="2.96">historical terms</text><text start="1287.96" dur="3.54">and at the end of World War II there</text><text start="1289.94" dur="3.739">were about two billion people on the</text><text

dur="3.72">didn't have the type of tech that could</text><text start="1305.12" dur="4.08">destroy the biosphere because you can't</text><text start="1307.1" dur="4.86">overfish the oceans with fishing

dur="5.339">fishing equipment and on and on</text><text start="1317.0" dur="4.26">um so all of human history only brought</text><text start="1318.919" dur="3.601">us to half a billion people until the</text><text start="1321.26" dur="2.88">Industrial Revolution and then we're</text><text start="1322.52" dur="4.68">like oh look how awesome the hobber</text><text start="1324.14" dur="5.82">Bosch

8</text><text start="1335.72" dur="4.26">billion overnight but we went at World</text><text start="1337.64" dur="3.899">War II we were up to 2 billion but only</text><text start="1339.98" dur="4.02">2 billion that means we went from 2</text><text start="1341.539" dur="5.341">billion to 8 billion since then</text><text start="1344.0" dur="5.58">and that's because part of the solution</text><text start="1346.88" dur="6.179">to don't use these nukes</text><text start="1349.58" dur="5.82">was radically grow the economy via</text><text start="1353.059" dur="4.381">globalization the globalization

dur="4.079">superpowers not war because throughout</text><text start="1362.0" dur="3.539">all of history there have no not been</text><text start="1364.159" dur="3.361">long periods of Peace where

dur="4.98">so the answer was let's connect the</text><text start="1395.36" dur="4.559">whole global system</text><text start="1397.88" dur="4.679">and there were some Brilliance to this</text><text

yeah</text><text start="1609.919" dur="3.081">let's come please continue</text><text start="1614.419" dur="3.0">think about the scale of the market for</text><text start="1616.46" dur="2.64">a minute</text><text start="1617.419" dur="3.481">you have something like a hundred</text><text start="1619.1" dur="4.14">trillion dollars exchange hands every</text><text start="1620.9" dur="4.519">day

seriously</text><text start="1695.059" dur="3.72">but so that's the size of the economy</text><text start="1697.159" dur="3.181">today and it's obviously growing</text><text start="1698.779" dur="3.0">exponentially just to keep up with</text><text start="1700.34" dur="2.819">interest and if we didn't grow</text><text start="1701.779" dur="3.0">exponential you wouldn't keep up

the</text><text start="1716.36" dur="4.5">biosphere</text><text start="1718.52" dur="5.1">what the we did just it was so</text><text start="1720.86" dur="5.04">ridiculous but so</text><text start="1723.62" dur="4.799">um what is the market</text><text start="1725.9" dur="6.12">think of it as</text><text start="1728.419" dur="5.821">money is a kind of token for Value it's</text><text start="1732.02" dur="5.159">a kind of token for game theoretic</text><text start="1734.24" dur="5.1">optionality where it has no intrinsic</text><text start="1737.179" dur="4.801">value but it has a maximum optionality</text><text start="1739.34" dur="5.579">to get me any type of value I want I can</text><text start="1741.98" dur="5.1">get militaries with it I can get media</text><text start="1744.919" dur="4.5">influence I can change people's minds I</text><text start="1747.08" dur="3.78">can get materials and because I don't</text><text start="1749.419" dur="3.781">know how the environment is going to</text><text start="1750.86" dur="4.14">change the speed of adaptive response is</text><text start="1753.2" dur="3.06">the most important thing the ooda loop</text><text start="1755.0" dur="3.299">the speed at which I can respond to the</text><text start="1756.26" dur="3.96">environment so I don't want a lot of</text><text start="1758.299" dur="4.561">materials that might become less useful</text><text start="1760.22" dur="6.12">I want a lot of optionality to have</text><text start="1762.86" dur="5.46">whatever I want right and so if you</text><text start="1766.34" dur="6.6">think of</text><text start="1768.32" dur="7.26">money as a proxy for Value but only</text><text start="1772.94" dur="4.08">value that is measurable extractable and</text><text start="1775.58" dur="3.599">exchangeable</text><text start="1777.02" dur="4.139">and all the types of value that on your</text><text start="1779.179" dur="3.961">deathbed you'll really care about are</text><text start="1781.159" dur="3.841">not measurable extractable and</text><text start="1783.14" dur="3.539">exchangeable we'll destroy all those</text><text start="1785.0" dur="4.86">types of value in the pursuit of these</text><text start="1786.679" dur="4.921">types and we have to because they are</text><text start="1789.86" dur="3.36">right</text><text start="1791.6" dur="3.72">and</text><text start="1793.22" dur="5.22">so now think about that as a</text><text start="1795.32" dur="5.579">decentralized incentive system</text><text start="1798.44" dur="4.44">that is incenting all the eight billion</text><text start="1800.899" dur="3.361">humans to figure out how to get it</text><text start="1802.88" dur="3.12">because everything else they want</text><text start="1804.26" dur="3.539">requires it and everything they need to</text><text start="1806.0" dur="3.72">exist requires it the country is</text><text start="1807.799" dur="3.061">relative to each other the companies</text><text start="1809.72" dur="2.819">relative to each other the people</text><text start="1810.86" dur="6.059">relative to each other</text><text start="1812.539" dur="6.841">and so it incends them to innovate and</text><text start="1816.919" dur="5.221">it and sends them to act on existing</text><text start="1819.38" dur="7.26">Innovation so search algorithms and</text><text start="1822.14" dur="9.0">optimization algorithms right and</text><text start="1826.64" dur="6.779">so you can think of the global market as</text><text start="1831.14" dur="5.519">something like an AI</text><text start="1833.419" dur="6.181">in an intelligent system that is running</text><text start="1836.659" dur="5.88">parallel process on human compute on</text><text start="1839.6" dur="4.199">human beings and you know how radically</text><text start="1842.539" dur="3.901">powerful</text><text start="1843.799" dur="4.5">parallel process in the cloud is being</text><text start="1846.44" dur="3.06">able to run a lot of parallel process on</text><text start="1848.299" dur="3.48">computers did a lot more than</text><text start="1849.5" dur="4.2">centralized supercomputers could do so</text><text start="1851.779" dur="3.78">this is running parallel process on 8</text><text start="1853.7" dur="4.8">billion human beings and the clusters of</text><text start="1855.559" dur="5.881">Corporations and countries and whatever</text><text start="1858.5" dur="4.74">to incentivize them all to search new</text><text start="1861.44" dur="4.739">ways to make money and to optimize on</text><text start="1863.24" dur="4.98">existing ways and whoever gets good at</text><text start="1866.179" dur="5.041">that system gets more power in it and in</text><text start="1868.22" dur="4.8">turn lobbies and changes laws and</text><text start="1871.22" dur="3.3">changes cultural values of the media</text><text start="1873.02" dur="3.18">they create and whatever that makes a</text><text start="1874.52" dur="3.96">system better for them</text><text start="1876.2" dur="3.839">and anyone that opposes that system is</text><text start="1878.48" dur="4.199">also opposing those who are doing well</text><text start="1880.039" dur="3.901">at it so that there is agency to</text><text start="1882.679" dur="4.081">suppress that</text><text start="1883.94" dur="4.08">so the you can think of the global</text><text start="1886.76" dur="5.639">market</text><text start="1888.02" dur="5.879">as a misaligned super intelligence</text><text start="1892.399" dur="3.361">that is already misaligned with</text><text start="1893.899" dur="3.9">planetary well-being in humans that is</text><text start="1895.76" dur="3.84">running on all the

dur="4.021">the other technology and that is</text><text start="1903.799" dur="4.581">building all of the narrow AIS in its</text><text start="1906.08" dur="2.3">own service</text><text start="1910.0" dur="5.86">we said that</text><text start="1912.44" dur="5.7">most of the Nazis weren't Hitler</text><text start="1915.86" dur="5.28">so the the Hitler were all in</text><text start="1918.14" dur="6.06">relationship to today is this thing</text><text start="1921.14" dur="4.68">right we can call it moloch</text><text start="1924.2" dur="3.54">but this kind you can call it the</text><text
