thank you so much for being</text><text start="24.06" dur="4.68">here thank you for being here to</text><text start="26.039" dur="5.101">celebrate endings and Beginnings which</text><text start="28.74" dur="4.86">I&apos;ll talk about in a little moment thank</text><text start="31.14" dur="4.62">you everyone online who&apos;s tuning in from</text><text start="33.6" dur="6.24">all around the world</text><text start="35.76" dur="7.02">um and yeah I just want to uh explain</text><text start="39.84" dur="6.0">firstly why is only half of Rebel wisdom</text><text start="42.78" dur="5.04">here so David has been um really</text><text start="45.84" dur="4.739">struggling with his health recently</text><text start="47.82" dur="5.16">um and is very burned out and so we were</text><text start="50.579" dur="4.98">trying to find a way that he could</text><text start="52.98" dur="5.04">attend today and and make it not not too</text><text start="55.559" dur="5.581">overwhelming but it was just a bit too</text><text start="58.02" dur="4.559">much so today David is very much here in</text><text start="61.14" dur="3.3">spirit and I really want to bring him</text><text start="62.579" dur="3.9">into the room but he&apos;s not going to be</text><text start="64.44" dur="4.56">physically here he&apos;s he&apos;s just um not</text><text start="66.479" dur="3.96">really well enough to do so so of course</text><text start="69.0" dur="2.76">it&apos;s very emotional for me I would</text><text start="70.439" dur="3.121">really love him to be here but I</text><text start="71.76" dur="3.06">completely of course understand</text><text start="73.56" dur="4.08">um if you&apos;re not doing well and it&apos;s</text><text start="74.82" dur="3.96">just too much it&apos;s just the way it is so</text><text start="77.64" dur="4.019">um yeah I thought maybe we could we</text><text start="78.78" dur="4.019">could send him a lot of love just to</text><text start="81.659" dur="2.761">start with</text><text start="82.799" dur="1.911">um uh yeah</text><text start="84.42" dur="3.37">[Applause]</text><text start="84.71" dur="3.08">[Music]</text><text start="100.5" dur="3.0">so</text><text start="105.14" dur="5.259">what we will be doing is um Jonathan</text><text start="108.42" dur="4.08">rousen From perspective will come up in</text><text start="110.399" dur="3.54">a moment talk a little bit about what</text><text start="112.5" dur="3.299">we&apos;ll talk a little bit about what we&apos;re</text><text start="113.939" dur="2.941">both doing next and and Jonathan will</text><text start="115.799" dur="3.421">talk a little bit about what David&apos;s</text><text start="116.88" dur="4.62">doing next um because we both have</text><text start="119.22" dur="4.38">um in a way like I said this is a day of</text><text start="121.5" dur="3.479">of endings but it&apos;s also a day of</text><text start="123.6" dur="3.54">beginnings and I think both what what</text><text start="124.979" dur="4.2">David and I are doing next is very much</text><text start="127.14" dur="4.02">in the spirit of Rebel wisdom and it&apos;s</text><text start="129.179" dur="3.961">going to be happening within a kind of</text><text start="131.16" dur="4.5">wider Network that I don&apos;t maybe we can</text><text start="133.14" dur="5.22">figure out today what we call the the</text><text start="135.66" dur="5.1">corner of the internet and the kind of</text><text start="138.36" dur="3.9">line of inquiry that that so many of us</text><text start="140.76" dur="4.8">are interested in some people call it</text><text start="142.26" dur="6.479">the the sense making web uh The Meta web</text><text start="145.56" dur="5.64">I don&apos;t know I sped that up but there&apos;s</text><text start="148.739" dur="4.201">um you know there&apos;s very much um yeah</text><text start="151.2" dur="4.86">Our intention is very much that we&apos;re</text><text start="152.94" dur="6.0">we&apos;re Rebel wisdom ends because you know</text><text start="156.06" dur="3.74">what we were set up when we set up in in</text><text start="158.94" dur="2.879">2018</text><text start="159.8" dur="3.939">it was</text><text start="161.819" dur="4.621">um it wasn&apos;t that long ago in registered</text><text start="163.739" dur="5.941">but a lot has happened and as we know it</text><text start="166.44" dur="6.18">was brexit and Trump and it was this</text><text start="169.68" dur="5.88">sort of post-truth thank you yes the</text><text start="172.62" dur="4.979">realities of a post-truth world and what</text><text start="175.56" dur="5.58">David and I really connected around was</text><text start="177.599" dur="5.101">this feeling of what isn&apos;t being</text><text start="181.14" dur="3.78">expressed in the culture and the fact</text><text start="182.7" dur="3.96">that what isn&apos;t being expressed is is</text><text start="184.92" dur="4.14">driving so much of the polarization and</text><text start="186.66" dur="4.62">driving so much of our inability to have</text><text start="189.06" dur="4.8">conversations</text><text start="191.28" dur="5.52">um and so that that at the time really</text><text start="193.86" dur="5.58">felt uh super alive and I think I still</text><text start="196.8" dur="4.56">I still think it&apos;s incredibly relevant</text><text start="199.44" dur="4.74">um and then as time went on obviously</text><text start="201.36" dur="6.36">the world changed and the sort of um</text><text start="204.18" dur="5.22">being the rebels in a way feels less</text><text start="207.72" dur="3.36">important than finding a new synthesis</text><text start="209.4" dur="3.54">moving forward</text><text start="211.08" dur="3.42">um and for both me and David we both</text><text start="212.94" dur="3.439">have visions of what that synthesis</text><text start="214.5" dur="4.5">looks like which are which are somewhat</text><text start="216.379" dur="5.561">Divergent but also similar in some ways</text><text start="219.0" dur="4.5">as well so um we&apos;ll talk about that in a</text><text start="221.94" dur="3.48">moment and and Jonathan will give a</text><text start="223.5" dur="4.08">little bit more context just about today</text><text start="225.42" dur="5.64">so</text><text start="227.58" dur="5.219">um today is a very participatory day uh</text><text start="231.06" dur="4.259">and it&apos;s really about</text><text start="232.799" dur="5.52">you guys it&apos;s about Rebel wisdom it&apos;s a</text><text start="235.319" dur="5.64">really oh there we go you you know we</text><text start="238.319" dur="5.64">created a platform and a container and</text><text start="240.959" dur="6.84">and perhaps a particular</text><text start="243.959" dur="5.7">um ethos I suppose we could call it a</text><text start="247.799" dur="3.72">way of coming together a way of bringing</text><text start="249.659" dur="5.341">together sort of personal growth</text><text start="251.519" dur="6.421">practices with cultural conversations</text><text start="255.0" dur="4.38">um but it was really everyone who</text><text start="257.94" dur="3.9">watched everyone who engaged everyone</text><text start="259.38" dur="4.8">who did our courses everyone who filled</text><text start="261.84" dur="3.72">the container that was magical and</text><text start="264.18" dur="2.94">that&apos;s why it&apos;s actually very touching</text><text start="265.56" dur="3.419">it&apos;s just touching to be sort of</text><text start="267.12" dur="4.799">sandwiched between</text><text start="268.979" dur="4.981">um people in the room and people uh</text><text start="271.919" dur="4.141">online because also like during covid</text><text start="273.96" dur="3.6">especially we had an incredible</text><text start="276.06" dur="3.54">Community</text><text start="277.56" dur="3.0">um of online</text><text start="279.6" dur="3.599">um you know we&apos;re doing like three</text><text start="280.56" dur="4.44">things a week at times and then there&apos;s</text><text start="283.199" dur="4.261">a new community that sprang out of that</text><text start="285.0" dur="4.259">called emerging Commons which Adriana</text><text start="287.46" dur="3.239">and Nick will be talking about later on</text><text start="289.259" dur="3.421">as we as we knew the end of the day</text><text start="290.699" dur="4.381">looking to the kind of what&apos;s pollen</text><text start="292.68" dur="3.78">dating right what&apos;s emerging from from</text><text start="295.08" dur="2.82">One Thing ending and something in the</text><text start="296.46" dur="3.6">beginning</text><text start="297.9" dur="4.859">um and then practically you have a</text><text start="300.06" dur="6.419">schedule right after this introduction</text><text start="302.759" dur="4.981">um and Jonathan comes up uh John verakee</text><text start="306.479" dur="3.121">will very kindly leave us through a</text><text start="307.74" dur="4.44">contemplation practice</text><text start="309.6" dur="3.96">um just kind of get us contemplative</text><text start="312.18" dur="3.54">um and get us dropped in a little bit</text><text start="313.56" dur="4.919">then we&apos;re going to move into breakouts</text><text start="315.72" dur="4.919">which I&apos;ll explain the logistics of that</text><text start="318.479" dur="4.261">um in a little bit but we have the whole</text><text start="320.639" dur="3.361">venue so we use the whole Space except</text><text start="322.74" dur="4.08">for the study which is our sort of</text><text start="324.0" dur="6.36">storage room and kind of um Green Room</text><text start="326.82" dur="5.76">so uh but that&apos;ll all be made clear</text><text start="330.36" dur="5.76">um I just we have a really great team of</text><text start="332.58" dur="8.059">volunteers who might stand up if you can</text><text start="336.12" dur="4.519">yeah so we got Eileen in the back hey</text><text start="343.56" dur="4.68">I think Eileen&apos;s the only volunteer in</text><text start="345.96" dur="4.739">the room right now so hey Eileen</text><text start="348.24" dur="3.5">um so then we have Marta who who you is</text><text start="350.699" dur="2.531">Marta</text><text start="351.74" dur="4.38">Marta hey</text><text start="353.23" dur="5.33">[Applause]</text><text start="356.12" dur="4.06">samarta has been an amazing part of the</text><text start="358.56" dur="4.02">team for probably six six months eight</text><text start="360.18" dur="5.1">months maybe longer yeah so Bart is sort</text><text start="362.58" dur="4.679">of coordinating the volunteers uh and we</text><text start="365.28" dur="3.9">have a few more people coming so if if</text><text start="367.259" dur="3.421">someone has a name badge on they&apos;re</text><text start="369.18" dur="2.579">basically just going to be mainly what</text><text start="370.68" dur="2.82">the volunteers are doing and just</text><text start="371.759" dur="3.961">helping us move through the space and</text><text start="373.5" dur="4.44">fill the breakout rooms Etc so I kind of</text><text start="375.72" dur="4.8">look out for the name badges</text><text start="377.94" dur="4.86">um yes and then before I invite Jonathan</text><text start="380.52" dur="3.899">up I also just wanted to share my</text><text start="382.8" dur="3.5">intention for today and what I&apos;ve really</text><text start="384.419" dur="4.921">been feeling over the last</text><text start="386.3" dur="5.32">six months or so</text><text start="389.34" dur="4.38">um which is around endings and around</text><text start="391.62" dur="6.18">the end of Rebel wisdom which is</text><text start="393.72" dur="6.24">a real desire to simultaneously hold two</text><text start="397.8" dur="3.899">things at once without</text><text start="399.96" dur="4.019">completely collapsing into one of them</text><text start="401.699" dur="3.361">or the other which really speaks to so</text><text start="403.979" dur="3.66">much of what we&apos;ve been trying to do</text><text start="405.06" dur="5.639">with Rebel wisdom so holding it at one</text><text start="407.639" dur="5.641">time ending and and the finality of</text><text start="410.699" dur="4.56">ending and really being with that and</text><text start="413.28" dur="4.56">with just as much</text><text start="415.259" dur="4.44">heart and passion holding New Beginnings</text><text start="417.84" dur="3.6">so that we&apos;re not holding one or the</text><text start="419.699" dur="4.261">other but that we&apos;re actually holding</text><text start="421.44" dur="4.8">both of them really fully with all of</text><text start="423.96" dur="4.859">ourselves throughout today and that&apos;s</text><text start="426.24" dur="4.98">really what I&apos;ve been trying to do</text><text start="428.819" dur="4.621">um yeah over the last uh over the last</text><text start="431.22" dur="5.46">six or eight months or so</text><text start="433.44" dur="4.62">um so yeah I&apos;m gonna invite uh Jonathan</text><text start="436.68" dur="3.48">up just to talk about what&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="438.06" dur="4.94">happening more broadly as Rebel wisdom</text><text start="440.16" dur="2.84">ends thank you sir</text><text start="443.3"

dur="4.2">think it through as I speak there&apos;s a</text><text start="465.18" dur="3.239">bit closer yeah</text><text start="467.28" dur="4.74">um</text><text start="468.419" dur="5.881">I speak

those hats are personal they&apos;re</text><text start="478.74" dur="4.56">just me as someone who&apos;s enjoyed Rebel</text><text start="480.72" dur="5.34">wisdom they&apos;re my professionals director</text><text start="483.3" dur="4.32">of perspectiva and there&apos;s also my kind</text><text start="486.06" dur="3.359">of community head of representing what</text><text start="487.62" dur="5.4">Ali was alluding to earlier this uh</text><text start="489.419" dur="5.881">elusive Community that&apos;s sprung up</text><text start="493.02" dur="4.14">so let me take them in turn on a</text><text start="495.3" dur="2.58">personal level I speak as one of all of</text><text start="497.16" dur="3.42">you</text><text start="497.88" dur="6.12">as someone who has loved Rebel wisdom</text><text start="500.58" dur="5.16">who has been on their show a few times I</text><text start="504.0" dur="4.74">was um</text><text start="505.74" dur="4.139">invited on by David to speak to</text><text start="508.74" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="509.879" dur="4.08">Peter Peter Jordan Peterson itis</text><text start="511.8" dur="3.659">Peterson itis Peterson of course was a</text><text start="513.959" dur="4.32">big part of the early story of Rebel</text><text start="515.459" dur="4.801">wisdom and laterally you know more a</text><text start="518.279" dur="3.841">more interesting uh Channel you know</text><text start="520.26" dur="3.48">contested part perhaps</text><text start="522.12" dur="3.54">and that was in the woods in a very</text><text start="523.74" dur="3.18">memorable conversation with David I&apos;ve</text><text start="525.66" dur="2.64">also had a lovely conversation with John</text><text start="526.92" dur="4.2">graviki whom you&apos;ll see later today</text><text start="528.3" dur="5.28">which was memorable in its own way too</text><text start="531.12" dur="4.32">and I was asked to speak to</text><text start="533.58" dur="3.3">um my love of Robert persig in the in</text><text start="535.44" dur="4.079">the book club and all of those things</text><text start="536.88" dur="4.26">were very precious to me personally</text><text start="539.519" dur="3.901">um but beyond that I&apos;m like all of you</text><text start="541.14" dur="4.259">I&apos;m the guy listening to</text><text start="543.42" dur="3.12">any one of the great figures they&apos;ve had</text><text start="545.399" dur="3.421">on the show</text><text start="546.54" dur="5.46">while I&apos;m doing the dishes while I&apos;m</text><text start="548.82" dur="5.4">doing the shopping while I&apos;m taking the</text><text start="552.0" dur="4.44">kids to school sometimes with one one</text><text start="554.22" dur="3.78">headphone on and one off so I can hear</text><text start="556.44" dur="3.66">the kid but I&apos;m still like what&apos;s Daniel</text><text start="558.0" dur="5.04">smackdriver just said or whatever</text><text start="560.1" dur="4.32">so I&apos;m one of I&apos;m I I&apos;m with Rebels on</text><text start="563.04" dur="3.72">that sense and on that sense I want to</text><text start="564.42" dur="4.8">just Begin by saying something keeping</text><text start="566.76" dur="4.079">very much David&apos;s presence in mind great</text><text start="569.22" dur="3.84">tragedy that can&apos;t be here today but I</text><text start="570.839" dur="4.56">also saw him yesterday and I have his</text><text start="573.06" dur="4.74">permission analysis to speak to this</text><text start="575.399" dur="4.921">but not just their permission I want all</text><text start="577.8" dur="3.78">of us to just say fabulously well done</text><text start="580.32" dur="3.08">you guys have done something</text><text start="581.58" dur="13.329">extraordinary</text><text start="583.4" dur="11.509">[Applause]</text><text start="598.08" dur="4.86">and 20 2018 when it began</text><text start="601.32" dur="3.66">um I actually met David first of all in</text><text start="602.94" dur="4.32">2015 for those who remember there was an</text><text start="604.98" dur="4.5">alter ego gathering in 2015 where I</text><text start="607.26" dur="3.66">first met David and already there he was</text><text start="609.48" dur="3.539">kind of thinking things through and then</text><text start="610.92" dur="4.26">there was a gestation with Ali that gave</text><text start="613.019" dur="4.621">birth to Rebel wisdom</text><text start="615.18" dur="4.02">um 2018 is very different from 2022 it&apos;s</text><text start="617.64" dur="2.58">a very different world we&apos;ve gone</text><text start="619.2" dur="2.579">through something</text><text start="620.22" dur="4.08">but Rebel wisdom has taken us through</text><text start="621.779" dur="5.461">that time there&apos;s a sense in which the</text><text start="624.3" dur="5.4">sense making process</text><text start="627.24" dur="5.58">was carried carried a community and also</text><text start="629.7" dur="4.68">built one at the same time it met a need</text><text start="632.82" dur="3.42">of the moment</text><text start="634.38" dur="4.86">the need of today is somewhat different</text><text start="636.24" dur="4.86">but it remains true that the interiority</text><text start="639.24" dur="3.599">of human beings the ultimate nature</text><text start="641.1" dur="4.08">meaning and purpose of life</text><text start="642.839" dur="4.921">the attempt to get Beyond facile problem</text><text start="645.18" dur="4.56">solving to make sense in a broader</text><text start="647.76" dur="5.9">further deeper way</text><text start="649.74" dur="6.599">to bring your full self to your life</text><text start="653.66" dur="4.359">remains an imperative

it&apos;s beyond convention it&apos;s beyond</text><text start="809.339" dur="4.321">what has come before it&apos;s an attempt to</text><text start="811.079" dur="4.681">build a new world</text><text start="813.66" dur="4.14">and that&apos;s where we are and many people</text><text start="815.76" dur="3.3">now are beginning new initiatives as a</text><text start="817.8" dur="3.42">result of the

dur="4.741">which is director of perspectiva</text><text start="831.779" dur="3.601">prospectiva is a charity we&apos;re a</text><text start="833.7" dur="3.36">not-for-profit organization that&apos;s quite</text><text start="835.38" dur="4.019">important to stress because Rebel wisdom</text><text start="837.06" dur="6.06">was a company a for-profit and</text><text start="839.399" dur="6.12">successful commercial entity that could</text><text start="843.12" dur="4.26">have carried on had they wanted to</text><text start="845.519" dur="3.361">doing courses and you know building</text><text start="847.38" dur="3.78">memberships and carrying on in that</text><text start="848.88" dur="3.72">regard what was always clear however was</text><text start="851.16" dur="3.96">in addition to that it was a Community</text><text start="852.6" dur="4.62">Asset it&apos;s also an educational asset and</text><text start="855.12" dur="4.68">a philosophical

dur="4.201">cultural resources that remain available</text><text start="865.5" dur="4.26">from Rebel wisdom</text><text start="867.72" dur="4.26">Ali mentioned it&apos;s very important to</text><text

of rebranding there&apos;s no</text><text start="875.76" dur="4.139">question of just a fresh look of paint</text><text start="877.5" dur="5.16">as they say or a new name it&apos;s not as</text><text start="879.899" dur="5.641">simple as that something has to end</text><text start="882.66" dur="4.08">there really is a time to close</text><text start="885.54" dur="4.62">something</text><text start="886.74" dur="6.06">to be with that ending to process it</text><text start="890.16" dur="5.16">before anything else can arise and I say</text><text start="892.8" dur="5.76">that also mindful of avid and where he</text><text start="895.32" dur="5.28">is at the moment and how he is that time</text><text start="898.56" dur="4.2">is needed to</text><text start="900.6" dur="4.979">allow something to end to process that</text><text start="902.76" dur="4.86">to recover renew and then listen for the</text><text start="905.579" dur="3.0">Wellsprings of renewal but while you&apos;re</text><text start="907.62" dur="2.76">doing that</text><text start="908.579" dur="4.021">something has been created that still is</text><text start="910.38" dur="5.22">still extant it&apos;s still there</text><text start="912.6" dur="4.56">there is a about a quarter of a million</text><text start="915.6" dur="4.5">YouTube subscribers for one thing</text><text start="917.16" dur="5.039">there&apos;s a large newsletter</text><text start="920.1" dur="4.02">um community that is still waiting for</text><text start="922.199" dur="4.08">information and content</text><text start="924.12" dur="5.76">so the story now happens as a kind of</text><text start="926.279" dur="6.0">birth really because Ali has a very</text><text start="929.88" dur="4.319">exciting near future ahead with a new</text><text start="932.279" dur="4.321">book coming out and new ventures of</text><text start="934.199" dur="4.861">various kinds</text><text start="936.6" dur="4.26">and you know he will take that path and</text><text start="939.06" dur="3.6">I believe the bigger picture is one of</text><text start="940.86" dur="3.24">the main names for it</text><text start="942.66" dur="3.419">and</text><text start="944.1" dur="3.239">um meanwhile it&apos;s not quite clear what</text><text start="946.079" dur="3.241">will happen on the other side in terms</text><text start="947.339" dur="3.3">of the substance and name because we</text><text start="949.32" dur="3.12">don&apos;t want to rush that</text><text start="950.639" dur="4.26">but what I can tell you in its form and</text><text start="952.44" dur="4.92">it&apos;s sort of morphology is that what&apos;s</text><text start="954.899" dur="5.101">going to happen next is</text><text start="957.36"

dur="4.2">have a new name and a new emphasis</text><text start="996.3" dur="5.64">that&apos;s more suitable for 2022. and</text><text start="999.12" dur="4.56">Beyond Ali mentioned synthesis</text><text start="1001.94" dur="4.199">there will be aspects of that there will</text><text start="1003.68" dur="4.56">also be aspects of what is the nature of</text><text start="1006.139"

dur="4.02">going to happen to your career I I was a</text><text start="1057.679" dur="2.941">few you know six years ago I was</text><text start="1059.12" dur="3.48">traveling around the world playing

or emerges sister networks</text><text start="1361.34" dur="5.28">without explaining why sometimes we just</text><text start="1364.1" dur="4.5">did that that&apos;s why because</text><text

because we&apos;ve started the day</text><text start="1428.96" dur="3.54">and we&apos;re about to go into the content I</text><text start="1430.52" dur="4.56">just wanted to also</text><text start="1432.5" dur="4.26">um leave maybe have maybe a minute to</text><text start="1435.08" dur="3.78">just be with</text><text start="1436.76" dur="3.899">um well be with David in some sense and</text><text start="1438.86" dur="4.559">just kind of bring him into the room and</text><text start="1440.659" dur="4.681">just allow the feelings of of him not</text><text start="1443.419" dur="3.24">being here to just be kind of there and</text><text start="1445.34" dur="4.38">process a little bit I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1446.659" dur="5.161">overrun it as well I also know that he</text><text start="1449.72" dur="3.959">is very keen that it doesn&apos;t sort of um</text><text start="1451.82" dur="3.96">dominate the day and that we still have</text><text start="1453.679" dur="4.021">that aliveness and we still have that um</text><text start="1455.78" dur="4.32">space but I think I think in order to do</text><text start="1457.7" dur="3.959">that just just maybe just a few moments</text><text start="1460.1" dur="6.319">that we just sit with that so that we</text><text start="1461.659" dur="4.76">can be with it and then and keep</text><text start="1475.6" dur="6.16">I am going to stand up firstly I&apos;m</text><text start="1479.059" dur="6.0">excited about what we have coming up all</text><text start="1481.76" dur="6.779">day but especially uh about what we have</text><text start="1485.059" dur="6.901">coming up right now and so</text><text start="1488.539" dur="4.801">John viveki I have to say John has</text><text start="1491.96" dur="5.099">probably been the most influential</text><text start="1493.34" dur="5.94">person on my thinking that we&apos;ve</text><text start="1497.059" dur="4.801">um had on Rebel wisdom in so many ways</text><text start="1499.28" dur="5.82">I&apos;ve had the great pleasure and feel</text><text start="1501.86" dur="6.0">incredibly lucky actually to have spent</text><text start="1505.1" dur="6.66">I think 64 sessions overall doing sense</text><text start="1507.86" dur="5.76">making 101 eight of them with John</text><text start="1511.76" dur="5.58">um and really and of course reading his</text><text start="1513.62" dur="6.36">work and watching his work on YouTube</text><text start="1517.34" dur="4.74">um yeah has really been instrumental for</text><text start="1519.98" dur="4.319">for both me and David and and the</text><text start="1522.08" dur="3.66">product as a whole and we wanted to</text><text start="1524.299" dur="3.661">start with John</text><text start="1525.74" dur="4.62">because the concept of the meaning</text><text start="1527.96" dur="5.28">crisis and John&apos;s thought is very</text><text start="1530.36" dur="4.74">wide-ranging and also uh transcends it</text><text start="1533.24" dur="3.12">includes the meaning crisis I think but</text><text start="1535.1" dur="3.66">I wanted to start with the meaning</text><text start="1536.36" dur="4.199">crisis because this has been something</text><text start="1538.76" dur="3.48">that we looked at in depth at Rebel</text><text start="1540.559" dur="3.901">wisdom and really felt very strongly</text><text start="1542.24" dur="3.78">throughout was that what some people</text><text start="1544.46" dur="3.599">have called the god-shaped hole in</text><text start="1546.02" dur="4.44">society which I think</text><text start="1548.059" dur="4.201">the meaning crisis is more than that but</text><text start="1550.46" dur="4.92">this sense of a lack of purpose</text><text start="1552.26" dur="5.039">Direction and meaning and culture feels</text><text start="1555.38" dur="4.38">absolutely crucial and it feels really</text><text start="1557.299" dur="4.141">difficult to talk about what&apos;s going on</text><text start="1559.76" dur="3.779">in the world and to talk about the</text><text start="1561.44" dur="4.14">symptoms we&apos;re seeing without getting an</text><text start="1563.539" dur="4.441">understanding of that underlying concept</text><text start="1565.58" dur="5.16">so we wanted to start the day with John</text><text start="1567.98" dur="6.26">and I&apos;d like to invite you up John and</text><text start="1570.74" dur="3.5">please give him a huge round of applause</text><text start="1575.6" dur="5.4">so what side do you want me on I should</text><text start="1578.419" dur="3.901">I&apos;ll be here</text><text start="1581.0" dur="3.799">that&apos;s why it doesn&apos;t be in the</text><text start="1582.32" dur="2.479">projectors</text><text start="1586.039" dur="4.281">you&apos;re blocking out the um yeah</text><text start="1590.919" dur="5.701">is that okay okay for you guys you can</text><text start="1593.72" dur="2.9">see us yeah right</text><text start="1599.0" dur="2.88">so and by the way we&apos;re a little bit</text><text start="1600.62" dur="3.539">behind schedule so what we&apos;re going to</text><text start="1601.88" dur="2.7">do is shorten the break</text><text start="1604.159" dur="2.341">sorry</text><text start="1604.58" dur="3.0">[Laughter]</text><text start="1606.5" dur="3.0">um we&apos;ll have a we&apos;ll have a comfort</text><text start="1607.58" dur="2.94">break but then I.E chat will come on so</text><text start="1609.5" dur="2.58">we&apos;ll have maybe kind of a five minute</text><text start="1610.52" dur="3.0">period where we need to use the bathroom</text><text start="1612.08" dur="3.479">we do but we&apos;re just going to go through</text><text start="1613.52" dur="4.98">so</text><text start="1615.559" dur="4.5">John firstly thank you for being here</text><text start="1618.5" dur="2.94">I&apos;m really glad to be here I really</text><text start="1620.059" dur="3.0">wanted to be here</text><text start="1621.44" dur="3.56">and Okay so</text><text start="1623.059" dur="4.681">I&apos;m sorry about this question</text><text start="1625.0" dur="4.36">but I had the real sense of wanting to</text><text start="1627.74" dur="3.48">ask you</text><text start="1629.36" dur="3.72">um You released Awakening from the</text><text start="1631.22" dur="3.959">meaning crisis a couple of years ago all</text><text start="1633.08" dur="4.199">right 2009 2019</text><text start="1635.179" dur="4.821">do you feel we are Awakening from the</text><text start="1637.279" dur="2.721">meaning crisis</text><text start="1640.94" dur="5.64">so</text><text start="1642.799" dur="6.721">I was at a conference called the</text><text start="1646.58" dur="6.42">Consciousness and conscience conference</text><text start="1649.52" dur="5.759">and of all places Thunder Bay Ontario we</text><text start="1653.0" dur="4.5">had a lot of people there</text><text start="1655.279" dur="3.721">and this will actually address your</text><text start="1657.5" dur="5.039">question</text><text start="1659.0" dur="6.36">um and everybody was talking about</text><text start="1662.539" dur="4.5">a sense of momentum that these things</text><text start="1665.36" dur="3.799">are happening there&apos;s a sense of</text><text start="1667.039" dur="5.101">convergence</text><text start="1669.159" dur="7.421">post-conventional convergence</text><text start="1672.14" dur="6.12">um and something&apos;s emerging and so</text><text start="1676.58" dur="3.54">I&apos;d probably</text><text start="1678.26" dur="2.64">speaking out of some selection bias</text><text start="1680.12" dur="3.0">because</text><text start="1680.9" dur="5.3">let people more and more want to talk to</text><text start="1683.12" dur="3.08">me about this issue but</text><text start="1687.08" dur="4.14">all the people I were talking to</text><text start="1688.94" dur="4.32">about how this is stirring up in their</text><text start="1691.22" dur="5.28">lives in their communities and people</text><text start="1693.26" dur="6.12">are addressing it so I think there is</text><text start="1696.5" dur="4.86">definitely something that&apos;s taking</text><text start="1699.38" dur="5.22">shape even taking on a life of its own</text><text start="1701.36" dur="4.62">and gaining momentum I don&apos;t know about</text><text start="1704.6" dur="4.38">how</text><text start="1705.98" dur="5.28">well it is doing with respect to all of</text><text start="1708.98" dur="4.439">the deleterious forces that are also</text><text start="1711.26" dur="3.24">accelerating</text><text start="1713.419" dur="3.481">um so</text><text start="1714.5" dur="4.799">the answer is you&apos;re gonna hate this</text><text start="1716.9" dur="5.879">maybe</text><text start="1719.299" dur="6.661">because there&apos;s it&apos;s not just an idea</text><text start="1722.779" dur="5.461">like there&apos;s emerging communities of</text><text start="1725.96" dur="4.5">practice emerging and where we had a</text><text start="1728.24" dur="3.6">meeting in Vermont of many of the</text><text start="1730.46" dur="3.839">leaders of these emerging communities</text><text start="1731.84" dur="4.62">and we&apos;re federating together we&apos;re</text><text start="1734.299" dur="3.061">producing a meta curriculum on how to</text><text start="1736.46" dur="3.54">design</text><text start="1737.36" dur="4.199">in the College of practices a vetting</text><text start="1740.0" dur="3.299">process so that we prevent each other</text><text start="1741.559" dur="3.181">from becoming gurus or anything strange</text><text start="1743.299" dur="3.601">like that</text><text start="1744.74" dur="6.179">um all of that&apos;s happening</text><text start="1746.9" dur="6.6">um but again also the way things are</text><text start="1750.919" dur="4.021">the medical crisis and the deleterious</text><text start="1753.5" dur="3.96">impact on people&apos;s lives that&apos;s all</text><text start="1754.94" dur="4.979">those forces are also accelerating so</text><text start="1757.46" dur="3.9">that&apos;s how it seems to me right now and</text><text start="1759.919" dur="2.88">probably</text><text start="1761.36" dur="3.48">um most of us will have some kind of</text><text start="1762.799" dur="3.6">sense of the what the meaning crisis is</text><text start="1764.84" dur="4.079">but it might actually be good to Define</text><text start="1766.399" dur="4.02">it especially if anyone is</text><text start="1768.919" dur="3.901">um kind of a little bit new to it but</text><text start="1770.419" dur="5.221">yeah I mean and has your conception of</text><text start="1772.82" dur="5.099">it changed since since you began this</text><text start="1775.64" dur="3.96">kind of Journey around it okay so I&apos;m</text><text start="1777.919" dur="4.521">going to give an answer and it&apos;ll take</text><text start="1779.6" dur="2.84">about 50 hours</text><text start="1783.559" dur="3.181">um</text><text start="1784.82" dur="4.2">so</text><text start="1786.74" dur="5.159">the way I usually try to talk about it</text><text start="1789.02" dur="4.139">is and I&apos;ve done this many of you might</text><text start="1791.899" dur="4.561">have heard this before and I apologize</text><text start="1793.159" dur="5.701">because it&apos;s come up in the courses but</text><text start="1796.46" dur="6.8">there&apos;s some core themes</text><text start="1798.86" dur="7.14">um one is the the very Dynamic and</text><text start="1803.26" dur="4.899">self-organizing processes that make us</text><text start="1806.0" dur="3.62">adaptively intelligent make us</text><text start="1808.159" dur="3.661">perennially susceptible to</text><text start="1809.62" dur="4.9">self-deceptive self-destructive Behavior</text><text start="1811.82" dur="5.52">both individually and collectively</text><text start="1814.52" dur="5.84">what I can say about change on that</text><text start="1817.34" dur="3.02">Dimension is</text><text start="1821.299" dur="3.181">not just my own but in collaboration</text><text start="1823.22" dur="3.36">with other people the scientific</text><text start="1824.48" dur="4.98">thinking about that has become more</text><text start="1826.58" dur="5.28">precise just recently published a paper</text><text start="1829.46" dur="4.14">um like just a month ago</text><text start="1831.86" dur="3.24">um in the Journal of phenomenology and</text><text start="1833.6" dur="3.179">cognitive Sciences integrating the</text><text start="1835.1" dur="3.299">relevance realization framework with the</text><text start="1836.779" dur="3.481">other big framework the predictive</text><text start="1838.399" dur="4.081">processing framework and this is a big</text><text start="1840.26" dur="5.639">thing scientifically so what I can say</text><text start="1842.48" dur="6.059">is if people are interested in more the</text><text start="1845.899" dur="5.221">scientific nuts and bolts there&apos;s been</text><text start="1848.539" dur="6.36">I think a considerable step forward</text><text start="1851.12" dur="5.58">there I I that may be</text><text start="1854.899" dur="4.14">the most important scientific paper I</text><text start="1856.7" dur="4.02">publish in my career</text><text start="1859.039" dur="3.921">we&apos;ll see</text><text start="1860.72" dur="5.1">I mean I might get hit by bus tomorrow</text><text start="1862.96" dur="5.62">but it&apos;s I think it&apos;s very important</text><text start="1865.82" dur="5.4">so the idea is but for us the idea is</text><text start="1868.58" dur="6.959">these processes are so powerful and so</text><text start="1871.22" dur="7.02">complex but and at the same time that</text><text start="1875.539" dur="5.481">means in in ways that are sort of</text><text start="1878.24" dur="6.6">ungraspable from our egocentric</text><text start="1881.02" dur="6.1">awareness we we are susceptible to very</text><text start="1884.84" dur="3.959">powerful and self-organizing patterns of</text><text start="1887.12" dur="5.939">self-deception and self-destructive</text><text start="1888.799" dur="7.141">Behavior and so we need</text><text

a</text><text start="3615.839" dur="5.701">way I&apos;ve conceptualized it and then we</text><text start="3618.66" dur="6.84">have what we&apos;re actually living through</text><text start="3621.54"

dur="7.74">wars right the and it&apos;s really</text><text start="3637.68" dur="5.639">um the reason I sometimes uh struggle to</text><text start="3640.859" dur="3.72">figure out you know whether to

dur="4.5">about when we actually engage with these</text><text start="3647.64" dur="4.86">issues it&apos;s real and we feel it and it&apos;s</text><text start="3650.52" dur="4.22">visceral and it

start="3657.54" dur="3.36">work</text><text start="3658.46" dur="4.659">unlikely that the meta crisis is going</text><text start="3660.9" dur="5.1">to but possible depends where you work</text><text

dur="4.081">kind of came to me it was like being</text><text start="3871.02" dur="3.42">cornered in a lift with someone that you</text><text start="3873.18" dur="3.899">hate</text><text

life completely</text><text start="3924.78" dur="5.579">changed I went through three to six</text><text start="3927.9" dur="4.62">months of absolute Bliss and Euphoria</text><text start="3930.359" dur="4.98">and everyone was wonderful and beautiful</text><text start="3932.52" dur="5.88">and everyone looked suspiciously good</text><text start="3935.339" dur="5.941">um and it was a really incredible time I</text><text start="3938.4" dur="5.04">spoke to everyone and I don&apos;t know felt</text><text start="3941.28" dur="3.9">a deep connection uh with everyone and</text><text start="3943.44" dur="3.119">everything around me</text><text start="3945.18" dur="3.899">um you know I remember during this time</text><text start="3946.559" dur="4.441">really weird things you know I was very</text><text start="3949.079" dur="4.441">much an environmental Philistine you</text><text start="3951.0" dur="5.88">know I knew nothing or I cared not much</text><text start="3953.52" dur="5.579">for nature and all of a sudden I was you</text><text start="3956.88" dur="5.58">know passing trees and weeping you know</text><text start="3959.099" dur="6.421">it was a really odd experience</text><text start="3962.46" dur="5.639">and and then just like any High</text><text start="3965.52" dur="5.76">um there is a come down</text><text start="3968.099" dur="4.5">um and my come down was you know lasted</text><text start="3971.28" dur="3.539">much longer</text><text start="3972.599" dur="3.48">um than the initial kind of euphoric</text><text start="3974.819" dur="4.02">stage</text><text start="3976.079" dur="4.74">um and in that time I was seeking I was</text><text start="3978.839" dur="5.041">trying to work out or it suddenly dawned</text><text start="3980.819" dur="5.341">on me that this really beautiful magical</text><text start="3983.88" dur="4.919">experience that I had could have</text><text start="3986.16" dur="4.08">potentially just been psychosis mental</text><text start="3988.799" dur="3.361">illness</text><text start="3990.24" dur="5.099">um and but you know there was always</text><text start="3992.16" dur="5.879">something that</text><text start="3995.339" dur="5.101">that stayed with me that didn&apos;t allow me</text><text start="3998.039" dur="5.04">to jump to that conclusion too easily</text><text start="4000.44" dur="6.84">and so I was seeking</text><text start="4003.079" dur="6.121">um and I was you know trying to</text><text start="4007.28" dur="3.72">I didn&apos;t realize at the time because I</text><text start="4009.2" dur="3.659">didn&apos;t speak even in the way that I</text><text start="4011.0" dur="4.74">might speak now the same vocabulary in</text><text start="4012.859" dur="6.96">language wasn&apos;t in regular use for me</text><text start="4015.74" dur="6.0">but I I think I was seeking wisdom so</text><text start="4019.819" dur="4.74">it&apos;s funny again that John mentioned</text><text start="4021.74" dur="5.819">that but I was seeking it in all of the</text><text start="4024.559" dur="6.181">places that I don&apos;t think it lives</text><text start="4027.559" dur="7.141">um and that&apos;s what kind of brought me</text><text start="4030.74" dur="6.0">into activism for a long while</text><text start="4034.7" dur="5.04">um I was you know</text><text start="4036.74" dur="4.74">I I can&apos;t say that I was a an activist</text><text start="4039.74" dur="3.599">in the way that we might understand that</text><text start="4041.48" dur="3.359">word but you know I was at protest and I</text><text start="4043.339" dur="3.661">was meeting people and I was talking to</text><text start="4044.839" dur="4.621">people and interested in conversations</text><text start="4047.0" dur="4.5">around race around gender a lot of the</text><text start="4049.46" dur="4.379">the hot button issues that are still</text><text start="4051.5" dur="5.339">very thorny to talk about</text><text start="4053.839" dur="5.22">um and I recognized quite soon that</text><text start="4056.839" dur="5.821">whatever it was that I was looking for</text><text start="4059.059" dur="5.461">in those people in those groups yeah it</text><text start="4062.66" dur="3.78">wasn&apos;t there</text><text start="4064.52" dur="3.539">um and actually I found that the ways</text><text start="4066.44" dur="3.899">that we are</text><text start="4068.059" dur="4.441">thinking around a lot of these topics</text><text start="4070.339" dur="5.48">and the ways that we are encouraged to</text><text start="4072.5" dur="6.119">look at one another was actually quite</text><text start="4075.819" dur="5.561">detrimental I knew that there was a</text><text start="4078.619" dur="6.901">chance that I could have had a psychotic</text><text start="4081.38" dur="6.78">break and I didn&apos;t want to go to</text><text start="4085.52" dur="5.22">um a therapist at the time I was sure</text><text start="4088.16" dur="4.5">that if I kind of explained to the</text><text start="4090.74" dur="3.72">average therapist that I you know went</text><text start="4092.66" dur="4.38">through this amazing psychedelic trip</text><text start="4094.46" dur="4.56">and I I had all of these new powers or</text><text start="4097.04" dur="3.54">it felt like I had new powers and you</text><text start="4099.02" dur="3.0">know I was meeting all of these guides</text><text start="4100.58" dur="4.32">along the way that you know there&apos;s a</text><text start="4102.02" dur="5.4">good chance of what I might be told and</text><text start="4104.9" dur="6.6">I wanted to I wanted to really explore</text><text start="4107.42" dur="6.839">whatever this was for myself and that&apos;s</text><text start="4111.5" dur="5.4">when I I guess I started to recognize</text><text start="4114.259" dur="5.52">um a lot of what was contributing to the</text><text start="4116.9" dur="5.58">the very prolonged state of depression</text><text start="4119.779" dur="4.44">that I had after that trip</text><text start="4122.48" dur="3.06">um and I yeah and I just recognized that</text><text start="4124.219" dur="3.421">a lot of the ways we&apos;re encouraged to</text><text start="4125.54" dur="4.62">think around many of these topics are</text><text start="4127.64" dur="4.26">exactly to be doing that and so the book</text><text start="4130.16" dur="3.74">is about</text><text start="4131.9" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="4134.12" dur="6.059">it looks up social media you know it&apos;s</text><text start="4136.58" dur="5.4">my awokening to maybe what we&apos;ve often</text><text start="4140.179" dur="4.981">called wokeness</text><text start="4141.98" dur="4.339">um waking up from it and realizing that</text><text start="4145.16" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="4146.319" dur="4.661">complexities you know is a beautiful</text><text start="4148.94" dur="4.56">thing and when you embrace it I&apos;ve never</text><text start="4150.98" dur="4.859">thought of myself as empathetic and so</text><text start="4153.5" dur="4.56">whenever people you know say to me that</text><text start="4155.839" dur="4.081">you you display quite a lot of empathy</text><text start="4158.06" dur="4.5">I&apos;ve always been somewhat taken aback by</text><text start="4159.92" dur="5.16">that because I I don&apos;t think that&apos;s what</text><text start="4162.56" dur="5.4">I was trying to do but I think when you</text><text start="4165.08" dur="3.659">Embrace complexity you reliably get</text><text start="4167.96" dur="2.52">there</text><text start="4168.739" dur="3.48">you know I think that&apos;s where that&apos;s the</text><text start="4170.48" dur="4.5">end point I think you just you know it&apos;s</text><text start="4172.219" dur="4.801">it&apos;s somewhat you know automatic it&apos;s</text><text start="4174.98" dur="2.94">part of that process</text><text start="4177.02" dur="3.839">um and so the book is you know</text><text start="4177.92" dur="5.939">encouraging us to think um</text><text start="4180.859" dur="5.641">more I guess you know empathetically</text><text start="4183.859" dur="6.061">around some of these topics</text><text start="4186.5" dur="7.08">um and about the ways that uh you know</text><text start="4189.92" dur="5.1">the current state of activism is kind of</text><text start="4193.58" dur="4.26">um making us</text><text start="4195.02" dur="5.52">um keeping us distressed</text><text start="4197.84" dur="4.859">thank you that&apos;s a really lovely summary</text><text start="4200.54" dur="4.139">um it makes me yeah I&apos;m feeling I&apos;m</text><text start="4202.699" dur="4.98">curious right now I&apos;m remembering back</text><text start="4204.679" dur="5.341">to the early events that we did where we</text><text start="4207.679" dur="5.341">would Rebel wisdom would be down the</text><text start="4210.02" dur="4.32">road and um reclaim uh and very often we</text><text start="4213.02" dur="3.54">would have a topic and we would have</text><text start="4214.34" dur="3.6">people come to discuss the topic it</text><text start="4216.56" dur="2.88">might be a little bit you know might be</text><text start="4217.94" dur="3.779">around gender or whatever it might</text><text start="4219.44" dur="4.02">something alive in the culture</text><text start="4221.719" dur="3.241">and the overwhelming energy there were</text><text start="4223.46" dur="2.82">two things I really noticed one was</text><text start="4224.96" dur="4.14">always</text><text start="4226.28" dur="4.5">um oh my God it&apos;s so good to talk about</text><text start="4229.1" dur="3.66">this freely and it&apos;s just like this kind</text><text start="4230.78" dur="3.66">of cathartic release and then the second</text><text start="4232.76" dur="3.899">thing was always I have no idea how to</text><text start="4234.44" dur="5.16">talk about this right because it is</text><text start="4236.659" dur="4.861">really hard and over and over we in fact</text><text start="4239.6" dur="3.54">did a whole course with Sarah Ness and</text><text start="4241.52" dur="4.98">Josh Krum called The Art of difficult</text><text start="4243.14" dur="5.16">conversations because so many of us have</text><text start="4246.5" dur="5.1">no idea how to approach a topic like</text><text start="4248.3" dur="5.76">race or gender in a nuanced complex way</text><text start="4251.6" dur="5.099">you&apos;re really good at it so I wanted to</text><text start="4254.06" dur="4.08">ask you what do you think is needed what</text><text start="4256.699" dur="4.02">are some of the things that really help</text><text start="4258.14" dur="6.96">us have those conversations</text><text start="4260.719" dur="7.081">well I I don&apos;t go into any conversation</text><text start="4265.1" dur="5.04">you know assuming someone&apos;s intent you</text><text start="4267.8" dur="5.52">know I&apos;m curious about people and</text><text start="4270.14" dur="5.34">wherever their political perspectives uh</text><text start="4273.32" dur="5.82">or wherever their political loyalties</text><text start="4275.48" dur="5.699">wherever they may lie is is not really</text><text start="4279.14" dur="4.14">relevant to me I&apos;m much more interested</text><text start="4281.179" dur="3.661">in why people think the way that they do</text><text start="4283.28" dur="3.66">um regardless of whatever the thought is</text><text start="4284.84" dur="4.379">and I think if you approach</text><text start="4286.94" dur="3.84">conversations with that in mind why do</text><text start="4289.219" dur="4.261">you think the way that you do what led</text><text start="4290.78" dur="4.8">you here uh what is your back story I</text><text start="4293.48" dur="6.12">think you know after my brother died and</text><text start="4295.58" dur="5.579">I had this um euphoric experience and</text><text start="4299.6" dur="4.32">then even the one after you become</text><text start="4301.159" dur="4.621">extremely hyper aware of death</text><text start="4303.92" dur="4.7">um and I think you know I&apos;m still like</text><text start="4305.78" dur="5.76">that and I think having death in mind</text><text start="4308.62" dur="5.74">very much has always made me want to</text><text start="4311.54" dur="6.659">know everyone know everyone quite deeply</text><text start="4314.36" dur="5.52">and to you know to to think of intimacy</text><text start="4318.199" dur="4.381">Beyond</text><text start="4319.88" dur="4.56">um the Romantic sphere</text><text start="4322.58" dur="3.599">um and so I&apos;m interested in people I</text><text start="4324.44" dur="2.88">guess I&apos;m just genuinely interested in</text><text start="4326.179" dur="4.741">people</text><text start="4327.32" dur="5.76">um and so that&apos;s probably why</text><text start="4330.92" dur="4.799">um I don&apos;t know I don&apos;t assume that</text><text start="4333.08" dur="4.139">people are are trying to be evil I think</text><text start="4335.719" dur="3.96">most people tend to think that their</text><text start="4337.219" dur="4.381">ideas are good you know rather than</text><text start="4339.679" dur="4.621">seeing the world as a combatim between</text><text start="4341.6" dur="4.68">good and evil I think it&apos;s often you</text><text start="4344.3" dur="4.02">know competing ideas of what people</text><text start="4346.28" dur="4.86">believe to be goodness</text><text start="4348.32" dur="5.22">um and when I think of it that way that</text><text start="4351.14" dur="5.7">somewhere in this idea that I may find</text><text start="4353.54" dur="4.5">noxious someone sees something good and</text><text start="4356.84" dur="3.899">I&apos;m interested to see what that is</text><text start="4358.04" dur="5.159">whether I agree or not</text><text start="4360.739" dur="5.221">um and so I think that&apos;s one of the ways</text><text start="4363.199" dur="5.401">but also I think in terms of gender and</text><text start="4365.96" dur="6.92">race I guess it&apos;s because you know I&apos;m</text><text start="4368.6" dur="4.28">uh I think about</text><text start="4373.46" dur="4.32">I think about</text><text start="4375.14" dur="5.94">um the ways that I have been influenced</text><text start="4377.78" dur="5.76">before I think about the times when I&apos;ve</text><text start="4381.08" dur="5.4">had very</text><text start="4383.54" dur="5.639">um should I say a combative way of</text><text start="4386.48" dur="6.42">approaching things and why you know when</text><text start="4389.179" dur="7.02">I was a lot more you know binary in my</text><text start="4392.9" dur="5.66">thinking what was contributed to that</text><text start="4396.199" dur="4.441">um I guess it&apos;s through my own</text><text start="4398.56" dur="4.78">self-exploration and kind of always</text><text start="4400.64" dur="3.539">being somewhat aware of</text><text start="4403.34" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="4404.179" dur="5.401">the muck within</text><text start="4406.52" dur="5.639">um it doesn&apos;t really allow me to kind of</text><text start="4409.58" dur="6.36">um I don&apos;t know approach anyone with a</text><text start="4412.159" dur="6.181">certain type of hostility I mean I guess</text><text start="4415.94" dur="4.68">I&apos;m just very aware of my own dirt you</text><text start="4418.34" dur="4.859">know and I think when you are aware of</text><text start="4420.62" dur="4.619">it it&apos;s much harder to kind of make</text><text start="4423.199" dur="5.221">these broad Strokes about what other</text><text start="4425.239" dur="5.96">people are and I&apos;m really interested in</text><text start="4428.42" dur="5.759">I don&apos;t know maybe alleviating or</text><text start="4431.199" dur="4.48">helping other people or reducing some of</text><text start="4434.179" dur="3.721">the the issues that we see in society</text><text start="4435.679" dur="4.321">and I think you can only do that when</text><text start="4437.9" dur="4.92">you&apos;re prepared to listen uh with a calm</text><text start="4440.0" dur="4.98">temperament when you are less inclined</text><text start="4442.82" dur="3.3">to make other people know how good you</text><text start="4444.98" dur="4.08">are</text><text start="4446.12" dur="5.039">um in by condemning someone for how bad</text><text start="4449.06" dur="4.86">they are I think it just you know</text><text start="4451.159" dur="5.341">entirely changes the approach so</text><text start="4453.92" dur="4.319">um I guess it&apos;s curiosity you know maybe</text><text start="4456.5" dur="5.159">that&apos;s a really long way of saying you</text><text start="4458.239" dur="5.221">know it&apos;s curiosity and and not thinking</text><text start="4461.659" dur="5.101">of people in binary terms and</text><text

dur="3.0">social media</text><text start="4795.44" dur="3.36">um and</text><text start="4796.699" dur="4.201">I&apos;m curious one aspect of this question</text><text start="4798.8" dur="4.8">is what you make of Elon musk&apos;s Twitter</text><text start="4800.9" dur="4.56">takeover how you&apos;re feeling about it</text><text start="4803.6" dur="3.72">um and then also just more generally you</text><text start="4805.46" dur="4.14">know uh</text><text start="4807.32" dur="3.3">how much oh and this is this is</text><text start="4809.6" dur="2.579">something I hear so many different</text><text start="4810.62" dur="5.52">answers to and I swing back and forth</text><text start="4812.179" dur="6.721">how much of the polarization and culture</text><text start="4816.14" dur="4.44">wars would you lay at the feet of social</text><text start="4818.9" dur="3.299">media and the way the platforms are</text><text start="4820.58" dur="5.099">designed and how much of it do you</text><text start="4822.199" dur="4.861">believe is us you know this is a complex</text><text start="4825.679" dur="4.081">thing maybe um maybe we&apos;ll start with</text><text start="4827.06" dur="6.36">there and then we&apos;ll get on to Elon Musk</text><text start="4829.76" dur="5.7">um I I put a lot of it you know at the</text><text start="4833.42" dur="4.799">at the foot of social media</text><text start="4835.46" dur="5.279">um I think this is where many people</text><text start="4838.219" dur="5.701">have kind of um</text><text start="4840.739" dur="6.0">developed the idea that the way to be a</text><text start="4843.92" dur="6.02">good person is for one solely calling</text><text start="4846.739" dur="7.98">out bad people or is to be some kind of</text><text

we&apos;ve learned that there is</text><text start="4860.06" dur="4.28">um</text><text start="4861.26" dur="5.76">the status is conferred on us when we</text><text start="4864.34" dur="4.12">present

mean I don&apos;t think</text><text start="4871.28" dur="3.78">any of us were meant to know what so</text><text start="4873.26" dur="4.439">many people were thinking</text><text start="4875.06" dur="5.639">um at all and I I don&apos;t think we&apos;re</text><text start="4877.699" dur="5.04">equipped to deal with that I&apos;m certainly</text><text start="4880.699" dur="4.261">not equipped to deal with that I mean I</text><text start="4882.739" dur="4.861">don&apos;t understand I mean even when I was</text><text start="4884.96" dur="4.62">most active on Twitter I never searched</text><text start="4887.6" dur="3.9">my timeline like that feels really</text><text start="4889.58" dur="3.48">masochistic to me</text><text start="4891.5" dur="3.6">um just because you know there&apos;s just so</text><text start="4893.06" dur="4.98">much there and so little time to process</text><text start="4895.1" dur="5.099">it it feels like I don&apos;t know like junk</text><text start="4898.04" dur="3.24">food like they&apos;re injecting it into my</text><text start="4900.199" dur="2.641">brain</text><text start="4901.28" dur="4.379">um and so but I think when you are in</text><text start="4902.84" dur="4.56">the habit of doing that every day and</text><text start="4905.659" dur="3.301">the only way that you can kind of prove</text><text start="4907.4" dur="4.319">to people who can&apos;t see your actions</text><text start="4908.96" dur="4.199">that you are a good person is by what</text><text start="4911.719" dur="4.621">you believe</text><text start="4913.159" dur="5.641">um I I certainly think that um it you</text><text start="4916.34" dur="4.56">know a lot of the onus I think is on</text><text start="4918.8" dur="5.96">social media for the ways that the</text><text start="4920.9" dur="3.86">culture Wars have manifested</text><text start="4924.86" dur="5.76">so yeah I I think yeah it has um a lot</text><text start="4928.28" dur="5.399">to do with it in terms of Elon Musk I&apos;ve</text><text start="4930.62" dur="4.92">I found other people&apos;s reception to that</text><text start="4933.679" dur="4.02">to be really interesting you know I see</text><text start="4935.54" dur="3.96">on on the one side you have lots of</text><text start="4937.699" dur="3.421">people like you know yay for free speech</text><text start="4939.5" dur="3.239">like this is going to be great we can</text><text start="4941.12" dur="3.18">say whatever we want</text><text start="4942.739" dur="4.161">um and things like that and you know you</text><text start="4944.3" dur="6.18">have other people who you know feel very</text><text start="4946.9" dur="6.04">cautious of this move and feel like it&apos;s</text><text start="4950.48" dur="5.699">going to be really dangerous I certainly</text><text start="4952.94" dur="6.84">don&apos;t see Elon Musk as any Savior and I</text><text start="4956.179" dur="5.461">don&apos;t think that he can fix the issues</text><text start="4959.78" dur="3.3">that are going on now because even if</text><text start="4961.64" dur="2.64">you can say whatever you want on social</text><text start="4963.08" dur="2.76">media</text><text start="4964.28" dur="3.6">um the problem is that we&apos;re now living</text><text start="4965.84" dur="3.48">in a world where what you say on social</text><text start="4967.88" dur="3.24">media can get you fired from your job</text><text start="4969.32" dur="4.26">and it doesn&apos;t have to be eight before</text><text start="4971.12" dur="4.2">it just has to be unpopular and so I&apos;d</text><text start="4973.58" dur="3.18">much rather keep my job than a social</text><text start="4975.32" dur="4.26">media account</text><text start="4976.76" dur="5.04">um so I would I don&apos;t know for me being</text><text start="4979.58" dur="3.96">able to say what you want on Twitter No</text><text start="4981.8" dur="4.14">matter how controversial but still</text><text start="4983.54" dur="4.92">having to pay the penalty</text><text start="4985.94" dur="5.52">um in your real life because you know</text><text start="4988.46" dur="4.92">there is a a dominant ideology of how</text><text start="4991.46" dur="3.54">one should be or one should think and</text><text start="4993.38" dur="5.16">say on certain issues</text><text start="4995.0" dur="5.28">um doesn&apos;t seem like a real win to me</text><text start="4998.54" dur="3.36">um I don&apos;t use Twitter that much at the</text><text start="5000.28" dur="4.08">moment</text><text start="5001.9" dur="5.58">um mostly because I have been working on</text><text start="5004.36" dur="6.12">the book uh but also because you know I</text><text

to a few</text><text start="5015.4" dur="5.339">most people you see a sudden decline you</text><text start="5018.64" dur="5.16">know in their character in the way that</text><text start="5020.739" dur="6.121">they speak you know the wisest or maybe</text><text start="5023.8" dur="5.0">not wise but very intellectual people</text><text start="5026.86" dur="5.16">who Pride themselves on their

behavior</text><text start="5047.08" dur="4.92">um so yeah I do think you know once</text><text start="5049.78" dur="5.52">again yeah social media does play a</text><text start="5052.0" dur="5.9">large part in a sort of collective</text><text start="5055.3" dur="2.6">neurosis</text><text start="5058.0" dur="4.56">yeah I I would agree yeah I don&apos;t know</text><text start="5060.46" dur="4.259">what the percentage is but um yeah it</text><text start="5062.56" dur="4.02">seems to be</text><text start="5064.719" dur="3.121">significant</text><text start="5066.58" dur="3.84">um yeah

his argument is Twitter is a game</text><text start="5081.64" dur="4.14">basically right it made you you win by</text><text start="5083.739" dur="4.44">getting retweets and likes but Games</text><text

the game</text><text start="5100.54" dur="3.119">play a different game or play our game</text><text start="5102.4" dur="3.0">and that makes a lot of sense where you</text><text start="5103.659" dur="4.02">see this decline of value capture</text><text start="5105.4" dur="4.2">happens in institutions as well you go</text><text start="5107.679" dur="4.321">into perhaps a charity with the

again</text><text start="5131.32" dur="4.32">I&apos;m not I&apos;m not confident in this just</text><text start="5134.199" dur="4.02">because you know I I&apos;m not looking at</text><text start="5135.64" dur="4.5">social media so much anymore but I am</text><text start="5138.219" dur="4.5">you know still getting lots of emails</text><text start="5140.14" dur="4.62">from people who you

start="5146.14" dur="4.44">like I can have these conversations then</text><text start="5148.12" dur="4.619">I also encounter a lot of people who do</text><text start="5150.58" dur="5.34">feel like the

people</text><text start="5163.96" dur="3.42">um and so I think there is you know</text><text start="5165.28" dur="4.08">especially let&apos;s say around gender uh</text><text start="5167.38" dur="3.799">there does seem to be you know the more</text><text start="5169.36" dur="4.319">people kind of come out and talk about</text><text start="5171.179" dur="3.941">negative experiences or

dur="4.859">around there</text><text start="5179.86" dur="5.7">um but I&apos;m hopeful for more things like</text><text start="5183.159" dur="6.181">this I&apos;m hopeful for</text><text

start="5370.3" dur="2.52">things</text><text start="5371.5" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="5372.82" dur="4.919">and I wonder if you have any advice for</text><text start="5375.46" dur="5.1">how you can let go</text><text start="5377.739" dur="5.641">that and and</text><text start="5380.56" dur="5.46">leave people with more information and</text><text start="5383.38" dur="6.06">investing yeah I think it&apos;s a it&apos;s a</text><text start="5386.02" dur="6.659">good question it is certainly something</text><text start="5389.44" dur="4.44">I feel at times you know I think it is</text><text start="5392.679" dur="3.96">quite</text><text start="5393.88" dur="7.319">natural to</text><text start="5396.639" dur="7.5">feel a certain resentment when</text><text start="5401.199" dur="5.641">you know you&apos;re having to self-edit and</text><text start="5404.139" dur="4.5">self-censor so much you feel like you&apos;re</text><text start="5406.84" dur="3.359">not being true to yourself and if you&apos;re</text><text start="5408.639" dur="4.02">not being true to yourself sometimes</text><text start="5410.199" dur="3.121">it&apos;s very hard to like yourself</text><text start="5412.659" dur="4.261">um</text><text start="5413.32" dur="5.94">and so I I do get that</text><text start="5416.92" dur="3.9">but you know in my case you know I don&apos;t</text><text start="5419.26" dur="3.419">know if you&apos;ve ever been there but with</text><text start="5420.82" dur="3.78">my case I always have to remember that</text><text start="5422.679" dur="3.301">you know maybe not to the same degree or</text><text start="5424.6" dur="4.32">at least maybe that&apos;s what I tell myself</text><text start="5425.98" dur="6.36">but I&apos;ve been there you know I&apos;ve and</text><text start="5428.92" dur="5.34">and I think if you think back to a Time</text><text start="5432.34" dur="4.56">where you&apos;ve had ideas that you now look</text><text start="5434.26" dur="4.26">back on that embarrass you and that you</text><text start="5436.9" dur="3.42">can&apos;t believe you thought that and you</text><text start="5438.52" dur="3.48">felt it and you thought it with so much</text><text start="5440.32" dur="3.419">conviction</text><text start="5442.0" dur="5.34">um if you think back to where you were</text><text start="5443.739" dur="6.181">at that time and what was driving a lot</text><text start="5447.34" dur="5.7">of that conviction even though it was</text><text start="5449.92" dur="5.58">very deceptive I think it&apos;s um</text><text start="5453.04" dur="4.98">yeah it&apos;s a lot easier to see your past</text><text start="5455.5" dur="5.28">self in them</text><text start="5458.02" dur="5.639">I tend to and I&apos;m talking to someone</text><text start="5460.78" dur="5.399">that has that archetype</text><text start="5463.659" dur="4.861">um I don&apos;t often say what I think as</text><text start="5466.179" dur="4.621">much but I do find myself just asking</text><text start="5468.52" dur="3.78">questions gently not to kind of do a</text><text start="5470.8" dur="3.899">gotcha</text><text start="5472.3" dur="4.08">um but I think if I&apos;m you know people</text><text start="5474.699" dur="3.0">like to talk about themselves you know</text><text start="5476.38" dur="4.02">and people like to think they&apos;re</text><text start="5477.699" dur="4.741">interesting and so I think if you</text><text start="5480.4" dur="4.98">come to someone and have made them feel</text><text start="5482.44" dur="5.46">that way by the time I think you if you</text><text start="5485.38" dur="4.44">do feel compelled to and share some of</text><text start="5487.9" dur="4.68">your perspective</text><text start="5489.82" dur="5.64">um I don&apos;t think it necessarily has to</text><text start="5492.58" dur="4.86">go down as</text><text start="5495.46" dur="3.48">um explosively as it might have</text><text start="5497.44" dur="2.759">otherwise</text><text start="5498.94" dur="3.18">um and it&apos;s always about your language</text><text start="5500.199" dur="4.321">you know I often make sure when I&apos;m</text><text start="5502.12" dur="5.28">talking to people because now there&apos;s so</text><text start="5504.52" dur="4.98">many kind of buzzwords and catchphrases</text><text start="5507.4" dur="3.72">that as soon as you use it people think</text><text start="5509.5" dur="3.78">they&apos;ve worked out everything about you</text><text start="5511.12" dur="3.78">so you know if you use the word Virtue</text><text start="5513.28" dur="3.359">signaling some people will just assume</text><text start="5514.9" dur="3.42">that you&apos;re a conservative you know or</text><text start="5516.639" dur="4.5">if you even use the word woke you know</text><text start="5518.32" dur="5.76">then people will assume that</text><text start="5521.139" dur="4.981">um but often you know just I disagree is</text><text start="5524.08" dur="3.84">something that I think very much kind of</text><text start="5526.12" dur="4.5">can get people&apos;s backs up and so</text><text start="5527.92" dur="4.259">generally I don&apos;t often often use that</text><text start="5530.62" dur="3.0">word when I&apos;m talking to someone I&apos;m</text><text start="5532.179" dur="3.901">just like wow that&apos;s interesting because</text><text start="5533.62" dur="3.84">I see it like this as opposed to I</text><text start="5536.08" dur="3.36">disagree with that you know because</text><text start="5537.46" dur="4.32">someone&apos;s generally already on the on</text><text start="5539.44" dur="5.759">the defensive and so I&apos;m I&apos;m very</text><text start="5541.78" dur="5.34">careful with the language that I use and</text><text start="5545.199" dur="4.561">make sure that I&apos;ve given them enough</text><text start="5547.12" dur="5.82">space to</text><text start="5549.76" dur="4.979">um to share whatever it is they feel</text><text start="5552.94" dur="4.14">um without being</text><text start="5554.739" dur="3.601">yeah without being defensive um but I</text><text start="5557.08" dur="3.0">think more so than anything it&apos;s just</text><text start="5558.34" dur="3.42">remembering you know I&apos;ve been there in</text><text start="5560.08" dur="3.36">some way shape or formed and in many</text><text start="5561.76" dur="2.7">ways I think it is a youthful rite of</text><text start="5563.44" dur="3.0">passage</text><text start="5564.46" dur="4.08">um the problem now I think is that it&apos;s</text><text start="5566.44" dur="3.96">extended Beyond youth for many people</text><text start="5568.54" dur="4.74">you know and it&apos;s become quite dominant</text><text start="5570.4" dur="4.02">uh amongst you know people teaching the</text><text start="5573.28" dur="4.74">youth</text><text start="5574.42" dur="6.6">um and that is unsettling to me</text><text start="5578.02" dur="4.8">um but yeah I think you know remembering</text><text start="5581.02" dur="3.84">that people are seeking meaning and</text><text start="5582.82" dur="3.899">reasons for the way of why their lives</text><text start="5584.86" dur="4.26">are the way that they are</text><text start="5586.719" dur="3.96">um and I think you know whenever I&apos;m in</text><text start="5589.12" dur="4.26">my worst moment you know I can sometimes</text><text start="5590.679" dur="4.56">see the impulse I want to oh it&apos;s</text><text start="5593.38" dur="2.88">because of this it&apos;s because of that you</text><text start="5595.239" dur="3.721">know</text><text start="5596.26" dur="4.02">um and so yeah keeping that in mind it</text><text start="5598.96" dur="4.38">generally helps me I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="5600.28" dur="4.74">that&apos;s a helpful answer but yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="5603.34" dur="4.76">what I think</text><text start="5605.02" dur="3.08">good answer thank you</text><text start="5610.239" dur="5.041">yeah we&apos;re gonna take uh one from online</text><text start="5613.6" dur="3.599">you just gave me a horrible flashback to</text><text start="5615.28" dur="4.919">my in Rand days when I was 19 as well</text><text start="5617.199" dur="4.741">you know this way but embarrassing ideas</text><text start="5620.199" dur="4.081">um yeah no but it&apos;s really yeah that&apos;s a</text><text start="5621.94" dur="4.5">really lovely advice I think um so</text><text start="5624.28" dur="3.78">moving swiftly on uh we&apos;re gonna hear</text><text start="5626.44" dur="3.9">from someone online yeah that&apos;s right</text><text start="5628.06" dur="4.74">we&apos;ve got a question from Helen Santos</text><text start="5630.34" dur="3.839">wave your hand Helen up there on the</text><text start="5632.8" dur="3.96">board</text><text start="5634.179" dur="4.261">uh would it even be appropriate to fill</text><text start="5636.76" dur="4.379">an interest in the opposite point of</text><text start="5638.44" dur="5.699">view when in the face of

dur="4.559">are the big ones</text><text start="5648.04" dur="4.619">how that affects our notion of right and</text><text start="5651.159" dur="4.681">wrong</text><text start="5652.659" dur="4.261">does that make sense yeah I think so so</text><text start="5655.84" dur="5.28">um</text><text start="5656.92" dur="6.299">is Helen asking you know is it is it a</text><text start="5661.12" dur="3.72">good idea to have curiosity about</text><text start="5663.219" dur="4.881">everyone especially people who commit</text><text start="5664.84" dur="3.26">the most atrocious Acts</text><text start="5669.12" dur="4.9">I think so actually I think you know</text><text start="5672.159" dur="2.881">when my I mentioned that my my brother</text><text start="5674.02" dur="2.4">died</text><text start="5675.04" dur="5.04">um maybe what I didn&apos;t say is that he</text><text start="5676.42" dur="6.18">was murdered and and that is actually</text><text start="5680.08" dur="5.34">where this

start="5688.06" dur="6.599">everyone uh which is um</text><text start="5691.6" dur="5.88">which only affects me you know was to</text><text start="5694.659" dur="4.261">try and figure out you know and you know</text><text start="5697.48" dur="3.239">I&apos;ll never know but at least to</text><text start="5698.92" dur="4.46">speculate to be curious and to be</text><text start="5700.719"

start="5865.12" dur="3.78">you know because that&apos;s I think I</text><text start="5867.639" dur="2.58">started thinking about self-deception</text><text start="5868.9" dur="4.259">around the time that my brother died</text><text start="5870.219" dur="4.861">because I recognize that this person who</text><text start="5873.159" dur="4.56">did it must have told themselves a story</text><text start="5875.08" dur="6.48">you know a convincing story that made</text><text start="5877.719" dur="6.541">this okay and so I think a lot of what I</text><text start="5881.56" dur="6.24">share online and write about is trying</text><text start="5884.26" dur="6.3">to get us more comfortable uh with</text><text start="5887.8" dur="4.74">recognizing that we deceive ourselves in</text><text start="5890.56" dur="5.28">lots of different ways and that we do</text><text start="5892.54" dur="4.679">this to our own detriment and and perils</text><text start="5895.84" dur="4.26">sometimes</text><text start="5897.219" dur="4.861">um and I think if we can or at least</text><text start="5900.1" dur="4.02">maybe all I can say is what I try to do</text><text start="5902.08" dur="4.32">because you know as much as some people</text><text start="5904.12" dur="3.9">would say that I should say or talk</text><text start="5906.4" dur="3.6">about controversial

start="5912.54" dur="4.48">you know</text><text start="5914.92" dur="3.779">um slandering me very much</text><text start="5917.02" dur="4.639">um and I think you know</text><text start="5918.699" dur="2.96">that is because</text><text start="5921.76" dur="4.5">you know I&apos;m I&apos;m I&apos;m not necessarily or</text><text start="5924.58" dur="4.02">at least I hope I&apos;m not climbing across</text><text start="5926.26" dur="4.62">like I&apos;m I&apos;m talking from the Ivory</text><text start="5928.6" dur="4.559">Tower you know I&apos;m talking from you know</text><text

I&apos;m just trying to figure</text><text start="5937.12" dur="2.7">out a different way of how to deal with</text><text start="5938.56" dur="2.159">it</text><text start="5939.82" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="5940.719" dur="4.44">so I don&apos;t know I think</text><text start="5942.76" dur="4.26">this is not maybe the clearest answer</text><text start="5945.159" dur="3.721">but I think we need to get comfortable</text><text start="5947.02" dur="4.44">knowing that</text><text start="5948.88" dur="4.74">um sometimes we are The Architects of</text><text start="5951.46" dur="4.02">our own pain and that doesn&apos;t make us a</text><text start="5953.62" dur="3.78">bad person because we&apos;ve kind of adopted</text><text start="5955.48" dur="3.54">bad thinking Styles because you know it</text><text start="5957.4" dur="2.819">could have come from you know the</text><text start="5959.02" dur="3.3">influence of that could have come from</text><text start="5960.219" dur="3.901">many different places but I think as</text><text start="5962.32" dur="4.379">long as people are always looking out</text><text start="5964.12" dur="5.4">there for the answer</text><text start="5966.699" dur="6.301">um I think yeah I think you end up</text><text start="5969.52" dur="5.1">staying in that state for a lot longer</text><text start="5973.0" dur="3.6">um but then also at the same time it&apos;s</text><text start="5974.62" dur="4.079">hard because there&apos;s a maybe a thin line</text><text start="5976.6" dur="4.74">between like self-exploration and just</text><text start="5978.699" dur="6.121">you know self Obsession</text><text start="5981.34" dur="6.6">um and you know how you walk that line</text><text start="5984.82" dur="5.16">um is is a difficult one but again I</text><text start="5987.94" dur="4.38">think I&apos;ll just maybe settle on I think</text><text start="5989.98" dur="3.84">if we get comfortable you know knowing</text><text start="5992.32" dur="4.5">because I think that&apos;s what I don&apos;t see</text><text start="5993.82" dur="4.74">I think every time I often see this type</text><text start="5996.82" dur="3.72">of archetype you know talking about</text><text start="5998.56" dur="3.24">their suffering it&apos;s always kind of you</text><text start="6000.54" dur="3.0">know been imposed on them by some</text><text start="6001.8" dur="3.06">external Force</text><text start="6003.54" dur="3.119">um but maybe it&apos;s the way that we should</text><text start="6004.86" dur="4.02">start thinking about our suffering I</text><text start="6006.659" dur="5.04">often do think that suffering can be it</text><text start="6008.88" dur="4.98">has in my life at least it&apos;s been you</text><text start="6011.699" dur="4.141">know a great Catalyst</text><text start="6013.86" dur="4.02">um for change positive change and I</text><text start="6015.84" dur="4.62">think an idea that needs to be</text><text start="6017.88" dur="3.6">introduced into the mainstream more is</text><text start="6020.46" dur="3.0">um what psychologists call</text><text start="6021.48" dur="3.54">post-traumatic growth you know because</text><text start="6023.46" dur="4.8">we hear a lot about</text><text start="6025.02" dur="5.82">um PTSD and things like that but I I</text><text start="6028.26" dur="3.78">post traumatic growth is maybe what some</text><text start="6030.84" dur="3.72">people might think of as a spiritual</text><text start="6032.04" dur="5.46">Awakening or some life-changing at the</text><text start="6034.56" dur="4.26">moment and I&apos;m interested in how you can</text><text start="6037.5" dur="3.48">get to that place because I do think</text><text start="6038.82" dur="4.08">that place is maybe available to more of</text><text start="6040.98" dur="4.08">us than we think if not all I&apos;d like to</text><text start="6042.9" dur="4.319">believe is on the other side of our</text><text start="6045.06" dur="5.52">mental maladies but as long as we don&apos;t</text><text start="6047.219" dur="5.041">allow the Mind viruses to seep it</text><text start="6050.58" dur="3.24">um completely at least you know I think</text><text start="6052.26" dur="3.66">that&apos;s waiting for people</text><text start="6053.82" dur="3.419">so yeah there is another side to all of</text><text start="6055.92" dur="4.34">this</text><text start="6057.239" dur="3.021">yeah amazing</text><text start="6066.719" dur="5.041">look at that the timing of the battery</text><text start="6069.719" dur="4.201">running out on the tablet is just</text><text start="6071.76" dur="3.72">perfect Aisha thank you so much that was</text><text start="6073.92" dur="4.219">absolutely excellent that was really a</text><text start="6075.48" dur="2.659">pleasure thank you</text><text start="6080.699" dur="4.921">yeah so my prompt for you guys is I mean</text><text start="6083.88" dur="3.06">I think one of the</text><text start="6085.62" dur="3.48">things that&apos;s exciting about this</text><text start="6086.94" dur="3.84">conversation is that it&apos;s</text><text start="6089.1" dur="4.559">well it&apos;s a meta crisis meets meaning</text><text start="6090.78" dur="4.62">crisis in some ways that&apos;s that&apos;s uh</text><text start="6093.659" dur="5.52">sounds like a horror movie I know right</text><text start="6095.4" dur="6.06">yeah yeah so so</text><text start="6099.179" dur="3.48">um but I I&apos;d like to just start with</text><text start="6101.46" dur="2.88">asking you</text><text start="6102.659" dur="3.601">just initially where do you each</text><text start="6104.34" dur="3.899">individually see those two concepts</text><text start="6106.26" dur="3.419">intersecting The Meta crisis and the</text><text start="6108.239" dur="4.581">meaning crisis where do they speak to</text><text start="6109.679" dur="3.141">each other where do they overlap</text><text start="6114.719" dur="2.701">um so I&apos;ve been asked that question a</text><text start="6116.159" dur="2.04">few times</text><text start="6117.42" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="6118.199" dur="7.681">and</text><text start="6120.78" dur="5.7">um for me part of the answer is this</text><text start="6125.88" dur="2.759">um</text><text start="6126.48" dur="3.179">I think the meaning crisis is an</text><text start="6128.639" dur="4.681">important</text><text start="6129.659" dur="5.881">instance of scarcity mentality so and</text><text start="6133.32" dur="5.1">human beings lack a particularly</text><text start="6135.54" dur="4.5">important resource it has very</text><text start="6138.42" dur="4.02">comprehensive effects on their cognition</text><text start="6140.04" dur="3.96">they become very short-term they become</text><text start="6142.44" dur="3.739">inflexible in their thinking their</text><text start="6144.0" dur="4.619">Insight capacity goes down</text><text start="6146.179" dur="4.841">this is very reliable and it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="6148.619" dur="3.961">have to be for food because people will</text><text start="6151.02" dur="2.82">actually give up fruit for meaning that</text><text start="6152.58" dur="4.079">tells you how important meaning is so</text><text start="6153.84" dur="6.06">when there&apos;s a meaning scarcity what it</text><text start="6156.659" dur="6.321">tends to do is really significantly</text><text start="6159.9" dur="6.96">limit the cognitive</text><text start="6162.98" dur="4.78">and effective resources we can bring to</text><text start="6166.86" dur="3.72">bear</text><text start="6167.76" dur="5.7">on the metacrisis so I think one of the</text><text start="6170.58" dur="3.84">things that I&apos;m interested in is that</text><text start="6173.46" dur="4.08">direction</text><text start="6174.42" dur="6.36">that the meeting crisis in fact</text><text start="6177.54" dur="5.88">contributes to an inability to properly</text><text start="6180.78" dur="4.74">get come to grips with the metacrisis in</text><text start="6183.42" dur="4.5">a serious way I think there&apos;s also a</text><text start="6185.52" dur="4.38">reverse error of causation I think the</text><text start="6187.92" dur="4.5">meta crisis</text><text start="6189.9" dur="5.239">contributes to an ongoing and increasing</text><text start="6192.42" dur="5.94">sense of domicide for people the sense</text><text start="6195.139" dur="5.98">and if you&apos;re not familiar with that I I</text><text start="6198.36" dur="4.62">the domicide is the sense of</text><text start="6201.119" dur="3.12">not having a home and it doesn&apos;t mean</text><text start="6202.98" dur="2.88">you don&apos;t have a dwelling you can have a</text><text start="6204.239" dur="4.321">dwelling and still experience Dharma so</text><text start="6205.86" dur="4.379">it&apos;s a sense of not being at home that</text><text start="6208.56" dur="4.5">you don&apos;t belong</text><text start="6210.239" dur="5.821">um that there&apos;s a kind of fit between</text><text start="6213.06" dur="4.8">you and the world and this causes of</text><text start="6216.06" dur="4.079">course anxiety senses of absurdity</text><text start="6217.86" dur="6.12">alienation so I think as many people</text><text start="6220.139" dur="6.06">frame the world as dying</text><text start="6223.98" dur="3.06">that exacerbates the meaning crisis for</text><text start="6226.199" dur="4.621">them</text><text start="6227.04" dur="6.84">so I see the two having a vicious</text><text start="6230.82" dur="6.06">feedback relationship with each other</text><text start="6233.88" dur="3.0">foreign</text><text start="6238.699" dur="6.581">how they become like</text><text start="6242.36" dur="5.2">memed terms The Meta crisis meets the</text><text start="6245.28" dur="3.6">meaning crisis it sounds like kind of</text><text start="6247.56" dur="3.32">markety</text><text start="6248.88" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="6252.78" dur="4.5">I mean they&apos;re facets of the same thing</text><text start="6254.4" dur="6.06">in the bi-directionality is clear and I</text><text start="6257.28" dur="5.28">just want to acknowledge that</text><text start="6260.46" dur="3.719">well we&apos;ve both expressed what these</text><text start="6262.56" dur="3.059">things are and probably most people here</text><text start="6264.179" dur="4.44">have taken it in</text><text start="6265.619" dur="5.401">some of it online</text><text start="6268.619" dur="4.681">the ability to actually unpack this</text><text start="6271.02"

start="6278.82" dur="4.379">we mean by meaning</text><text start="6280.92" dur="4.68">um and what are visions of a world that</text><text start="6283.199" dur="4.201">address metacrisis both long term and</text><text start="6285.6" dur="3.18">how we get there and like there&apos;s just</text><text start="6287.4" dur="3.0">no way we&apos;re going to do much so we&apos;re</text><text start="6288.78" dur="2.879">just going to like touch random spots</text><text start="6290.4" dur="5.759">here</text><text start="6291.659" dur="6.121">so a just a thought that came to mind is</text><text

earlier today</text><text start="6559.159" dur="5.261">and the interviewer was asking you what</text><text start="6562.26" dur="5.22">about decreasing attention spans from</text><text start="6564.42"

start="6573.119" dur="4.741">I have noticed is that the hypernormal</text><text start="6575.639" dur="4.98">stimuli whether through social media and</text><text start="6577.86" dur="5.879">kind of

low and</text><text start="6594.3" dur="3.6">um it&apos;s very easy to see that like when</text><text start="6596.219" dur="3.181">friends go</text><text start="6597.9" dur="3.299">camping in nature with other friends</text><text start="6599.4" dur="5.04">they just check their phones less</text><text start="6601.199" dur="4.92">and when they&apos;re in a richer field of</text><text

dur="4.3">restructuring economics to not have</text><text start="6616.44" dur="3.179">perverse incentive to that scale because</text><text start="6618.06" dur="3.119">it&apos;s an asymmetric warfare

start="6639.26" dur="4.6">discipline to avoid hypernormal stimuli</text><text start="6641.76" dur="4.379">it&apos;s how do we create a richer life of</text><text start="6643.86"

you just said is unlike lies</text><text start="6705.54" dur="3.659">like it&apos;s very hard to lie to yourself</text><text start="6707.46" dur="3.84">technically but it&apos;s very easy to</text><text start="6709.199" dur="5.04"> yourself because all because</text><text start="6711.3" dur="5.819">when you attend to something</text><text start="6714.239" dur="4.5">right that actually there&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="6717.119" dur="3.0">three dimensions that drive attention</text><text start="6718.739" dur="3.48">and one of them is your history of what</text><text

dur="2.761">likely to pay attention to it so you&apos;re</text><text start="6724.38" dur="3.54">more likely to pay attention to it which</text><text start="6725.94" dur="3.779">means when you walk

dur="3.54">um</text><text start="6737.88" dur="4.56">what I think</text><text start="6739.98" dur="5.1">is happening is is it has a way</text><text start="6742.44" dur="4.14">of growing exponentially in a way that</text><text start="6745.08" dur="4.559">lying doesn&apos;t</text><text start="6746.58" dur="5.039">and so I think</text><text start="6749.639" dur="3.301">correction yes and avoiding error</text><text start="6751.619" dur="4.381">correction right because it uncouples</text><text start="6752.94" dur="6.239">you from do I understand this</text><text start="6756.0" dur="5.219">um like people people now confuse</text><text start="6759.179" dur="4.081">sending something that they haven&apos;t read</text><text start="6761.219" dur="4.221">on the internet with knowing what it

dur="3.54">there there&apos;s a degree in which yeah we</text><text start="6778.26" dur="4.62">have to get people into these richer</text><text start="6779.88" dur="5.1">environments but I guess I I want to ask</text><text start="6782.88" dur="4.319">you a question is</text><text start="6784.98" dur="4.38">what because I&apos;m trying to get an answer</text><text start="6787.199" dur="4.5">to this question myself</text><text start="6789.36" dur="5.16">what I don&apos;t just mean skills I mean</text><text start="6791.699" dur="4.44">virtues I mean so there&apos;s skill that has</text><text

the things</text><text start="6814.32" dur="3.78">that are actually connected did that</text><text start="6816.179" dur="3.661">make sense as a question it&apos;s funny</text><text start="6818.1" dur="3.42">because I was actually just about to ask</text><text start="6819.84" dur="2.76">you a question that I was wondering that</text><text start="6821.52" dur="3.36">I thought you would have an answer to</text><text start="6822.6" dur="3.539">that I actually am going to avoid your</text><text start="6824.88" dur="4.02">question and do this one first and then</text><text start="6826.139" dur="4.321">come back to it because it might</text><text start="6828.9" dur="4.44">if you want to get I want to get to that</text><text start="6830.46" dur="4.14">but when I was listening to</text><text start="6833.34" dur="3.18">um listening to your talk earlier today</text><text start="6834.6" dur="4.5">and you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="6836.52" dur="4.619">relevance realization that oftentimes</text><text start="6839.1" dur="3.78">what we&apos;re not paying attention to is</text><text start="6841.139" dur="4.801">critical and we recognize that and yet</text><text start="6842.88" dur="4.56">we don&apos;t have the literal neurological</text><text start="6845.94" dur="3.179">bandwidth to pay attention to literally</text><text start="6847.44" dur="3.36">everything</text><text start="6849.119" dur="4.161">um and there has to be some preferencing</text><text start="6850.8" dur="2.48">that happens</text><text start="6853.8" dur="4.5">so something</text><text start="6855.6" dur="4.98">like people who are very good at being</text><text start="6858.3" dur="4.08">able to tell what might be relevant that</text><text start="6860.58" dur="3.84">isn&apos;t totally obvious but that is</text><text start="6862.38" dur="3.299">relevant to something else is one of the</text><text start="6864.42" dur="4.98">main cognitive traits I look for in</text><text start="6865.679" dur="6.181">people right and like if you want to</text><text start="6869.4" dur="4.56">work with me by the way if you&apos;re pretty</text><text start="6871.86" dur="4.319">good at knowing why something might be</text><text start="6873.96" dur="4.44">relevant to something else with good</text><text start="6876.179" dur="4.681">causal connections and then good at info</text><text start="6878.4" dur="4.38">compressing that then probably talk to</text><text start="6880.86" dur="4.14">me like that&apos;s the that&apos;s something I</text><text start="6882.78" dur="3.24">look for a lot</text><text start="6885.0" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="6886.02" dur="3.54">but I would notice in my own learning</text><text start="6888.48" dur="2.759">process</text><text start="6889.56" dur="6.179">I</text><text start="6891.239" dur="6.661">have done something that looks a lot not</text><text start="6895.739" dur="3.9">like the normal

dur="4.619">for some set of reasons early on</text><text start="6907.08" dur="4.44">I started to realize that the things</text><text start="6908.639" dur="4.441">that I didn&apos;t think mattered

dur="4.861">there&apos;s actually in interesting stuff in</text><text start="6962.699" dur="4.741">there and then I remember talking to a</text><text start="6965.04" dur="4.86">mechanical engineer who was talking all</text><text start="6967.44" dur="4.94">about the slope of the curb and how</text><text start="6969.9" dur="5.4">water ran off and the nature of the</text><text start="6972.38" dur="5.319">screw threads on things and I so I just</text><text start="6975.3" dur="4.08">started seeking out every everybody who</text><text start="6977.699" dur="3.54">saw the world in the most different ways</text><text start="6979.38" dur="3.9">about things that I totally thought were</text><text start="6981.239" dur="3.841">not interesting and really tried to see</text><text start="6983.28" dur="3.839">why it was interesting and relevant</text><text start="6985.08" dur="3.72">so what I was trying to do was do the</text><text start="6987.119" dur="4.02">maps of relevance of the things that</text><text start="6988.8" dur="4.5">were outside of my current relevant set</text><text start="6991.139" dur="5.04">and it was um</text><text start="6993.3" dur="4.439">you know Khalil Gibran said uh he was in</text><text start="6996.179" dur="2.821">meditation upon the Dew Drop that I</text><text start="6997.739" dur="4.641">discovered the mysteries of the ocean</text><text start="6999.0" dur="5.82">and this kind of sense that in a</text><text start="7002.38" dur="4.359">completely interconnected Universe the</text><text start="7004.82" dur="4.68">idea that anything isn&apos;t meaningful is</text><text start="7006.739" dur="5.46">actually at the basis of where violence</text><text start="7009.5" dur="5.76">and externality happens</text><text start="7012.199" dur="4.92">so it wasn&apos;t letting my attention be</text><text start="7015.26" dur="5.58">diffused and not try to connect it or</text><text start="7017.119" dur="5.641">just be a distracted into like</text><text start="7020.84" dur="4.92">um without real salience but</text><text start="7022.76" dur="6.359">they&apos;re like I don&apos;t think I&apos;m qualified</text><text start="7025.76" dur="5.399">to know what is relevant or not yet</text><text start="7029.119" dur="4.08">and I want to assume relevance and</text><text start="7031.159" dur="4.08">everything and then look for it I that</text><text start="7033.199" dur="4.081">might be maybe the most important or one</text><text start="7035.239" dur="4.021">of the most important traits in my</text><text start="7037.28" dur="4.08">like educational proclivities and I was</text><text start="7039.26" dur="5.1">curious to hear your thoughts on that</text><text start="7041.36" dur="3.0">excellent</text><text start="7045.26" dur="5.339">versus other processes for pedagogy and</text><text start="7048.26" dur="3.479">for developing people and I will need a</text><text start="7050.599" dur="2.821">piece of

start="7055.82" dur="2.76">um</text><text start="7056.84" dur="4.279">I mean I think you&apos;re still guiding that</text><text start="7058.58" dur="4.8">process by relevance realization</text><text start="7061.119" dur="4.301">because a lot of relevance realization</text><text start="7063.38" dur="3.9">is taking place unconsciously and Etc</text><text start="7065.42" dur="5.34">and I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t disagree with</text><text start="7067.28" dur="7.5">that but the deeper answer I think is</text><text start="7070.76" dur="7.2">that and I was privileged to work on</text><text start="7074.78" dur="5.879">paper with most of the academics doing</text><text start="7077.96" dur="5.88">work on wisdom and we were the point was</text><text start="7080.659" dur="5.641">to actually produce a consensus</text><text start="7083.84" dur="4.92">theoretical construct and this will get</text><text start="7086.3" dur="3.72">to your point in a second</text><text start="7088.76" dur="5.22">and</text><text start="7090.02" dur="6.0">what came out as the key ability was a</text><text start="7093.98" dur="4.92">meta-perspectival ability</text><text start="7096.02" dur="5.88">so what thing most predicts the people</text><text start="7098.9" dur="5.04">that we judge to be wise is that they</text><text start="7101.9" dur="3.54">try to internalize perspectives other</text><text start="7103.94" dur="3.84">than their own</text><text start="7105.44" dur="4.259">which is what you just described</text><text start="7107.78" dur="4.56">and they try to not but they don&apos;t just</text><text start="7109.699" dur="5.581">do it randomly like they don&apos;t like you</text><text start="7112.34" dur="4.68">said you didn&apos;t disintegrate right so</text><text start="7115.28" dur="4.26">they&apos;re complexifying they&apos;re</text><text start="7117.02" dur="4.02">simultaneously differentiating and</text><text start="7119.54" dur="4.02">integrating</text><text start="7121.04" dur="5.4">and then that when you internalize that</text><text start="7123.56" dur="4.98">that gives you metacognition you become</text><text start="7126.44" dur="4.5">more capable of knowing your own</text><text start="7128.54" dur="4.8">cognition because you internalize the</text><text start="7130.94" dur="4.679">perspective of other people on you so</text><text start="7133.34" dur="3.96">when you take in multiple perspectives</text><text start="7135.619" dur="4.441">and complexify them so they have</text><text start="7137.3" dur="4.02">emerging functions you also complexify</text><text start="7140.06" dur="2.82">and drive the emergence of your</text><text start="7141.32" dur="2.819">metacognition which improves yourself</text><text start="7142.88" dur="4.56">knowing</text><text start="7144.139" dur="6.121">which then improves your ability to</text><text start="7147.44" dur="5.279">choose which perspectives to internalize</text><text start="7150.26" dur="3.899">and you can get a positive feedback loop</text><text start="7152.719" dur="3.42">going and that sounds to me like what</text><text start="7154.159" dur="5.54">you just described</text><text start="7156.139" dur="3.56">how you would think about</text><text start="7161.26" dur="7.12">incorporating that kind of process into</text><text start="7165.38" dur="6.0">education</text><text start="7168.38" dur="3.0">so</text><text start="7171.739" dur="4.801">well you said a few minutes ago</text><text start="7174.86" dur="3.299">that if you wanted to change education</text><text start="7176.54" dur="2.88">you basically said but I need to change</text><text start="7178.159" dur="2.52">the world</text><text start="7179.42" dur="2.46">um and so I want to say something</text><text start="7180.679" dur="2.401">similar</text><text start="7181.88" dur="5.54">um</text><text start="7183.08" dur="8.34">because I think we have to challenge</text><text start="7187.42" dur="7.06">this framework about what the entity</text><text start="7191.42" dur="7.38">we&apos;re educating is the embodied mind</text><text start="7194.48" dur="6.84">so we have this notion that cognition is</text><text start="7198.8" dur="5.16">sort of self-enclosed magnetic</text><text start="7201.32" dur="5.04">that it&apos;s monological</text><text start="7203.96" dur="5.34">that we do our most of our cognition is</text><text start="7206.36" dur="5.64">done inside here it&apos;s monophasic there&apos;s</text><text start="7209.3" dur="4.2">one privileged State of Consciousness we</text><text start="7212.0" dur="4.56">should be in</text><text start="7213.5" dur="6.0">and I think all three of those</text><text start="7216.56" dur="5.34">are fundamentally false</text><text start="7219.5" dur="5.04">and that the framework which we get from</text><text start="7221.9" dur="4.98">people like Locke was built on those</text><text start="7224.54" dur="5.76">those three things</text><text start="7226.88" dur="5.04">and we have to bring in education</text><text start="7230.3" dur="4.799">in which</text><text start="7231.92" dur="6.48">children are being properly</text><text start="7235.099" dur="6.301">trained not just taught properly trained</text><text start="7238.4" dur="3.0">in</text><text start="7242.06" dur="4.02">what I like to call theologos the kind</text><text start="7244.099" dur="3.901">of conversation that is designed to do</text><text start="7246.08" dur="3.48">exactly what you were talking about it&apos;s</text><text start="7248.0" dur="3.54">not just a communication sharing of</text><text start="7249.56" dur="3.9">information it&apos;s like no I want to get</text><text start="7251.54" dur="4.74">your perspective such that I can</text><text start="7253.46" dur="4.139">internalize it we may not agree but</text><text start="7256.28" dur="2.879">something emergent is going to happen</text><text start="7257.599" dur="3.6">for me because I&apos;ve internalized your</text><text start="7259.159" dur="3.721">perspective and I try to afford you</text><text start="7261.199" dur="3.361">doing the same so we afford each other</text><text start="7262.88" dur="3.48">self-transcendence we have to get that</text><text start="7264.56" dur="3.659">to be a crucial part we have to train</text><text start="7266.36" dur="3.0">our kids to explore Altered States of</text><text start="7268.219" dur="3.661">consciousness</text><text start="7269.36" dur="4.5">so that they get a sense of whoa my</text><text start="7271.88" dur="4.319">salience Landscaping is way more</text><text start="7273.86" dur="4.02">malleable than I realized and there&apos;s</text><text start="7276.199" dur="4.081">all kinds of powers and there&apos;s all</text><text start="7277.88" dur="4.68">kinds of perils I think if you did just</text><text start="7280.28" dur="3.72">those two things you would already start</text><text start="7282.56" dur="2.76">to enhance this ability I was talking</text><text start="7284.0" dur="2.639">about</text><text start="7285.32" dur="4.74">just take the first one that you</text><text start="7286.639" dur="5.341">mentioned yeah you can see how that is</text><text start="7290.06" dur="5.34">actually an answer to conflict theory</text><text start="7291.98" dur="5.88">and to metapolitics writ large at the</text><text start="7295.4" dur="5.219">sociological scale it&apos;s the answer to</text><text start="7297.86" dur="6.56">externalities because the externality</text><text start="7300.619" dur="3.801">that is created is created by</text><text start="7304.84" dur="3.339">some group of people solving a problem</text><text start="7307.219" dur="2.4">where they&apos;re not in enough</text><text start="7308.179" dur="2.581">communication with enough of the other</text><text start="7309.619" dur="4.02">people in the landscape that would see</text><text start="7310.76" dur="5.459">where the externality was so enough</text><text start="7313.639" dur="4.381">complex perspective seeking and desire</text><text start="7316.219" dur="2.701">to synthesize them the two sources of</text><text start="7318.02" dur="2.52">all the problems in the world is</text><text start="7318.92" dur="3.48">conflict theory and mistake Theory the</text><text start="7320.54" dur="3.059">way that I frame it problems that we</text><text start="7322.4" dur="3.12">cause on purpose and problems we cause</text><text start="7323.599" dur="4.381">on accident and they both get addressed</text><text start="7325.52" dur="5.4">through that as does the meaning crisis</text><text start="7327.98" dur="4.92">as does psychological cognitive depth</text><text start="7330.92" dur="3.9">and complexity so</text><text start="7332.9" dur="4.62">um it&apos;s a pretty good starting place</text><text start="7334.82" dur="4.68">for me it&apos;s the heart of</text><text start="7337.52" dur="3.48">what</text><text start="7339.5" dur="3.9">um I get from the whole Socratic</text><text start="7341.0" dur="6.06">tradition can you get to a place where</text><text start="7343.4" dur="6.239">you can really realize that the process</text><text start="7347.06" dur="5.22">of self-examination and self-knowledge</text><text start="7349.639" dur="3.841">is inherently bound up with affording</text><text start="7352.28" dur="4.62">other people</text><text start="7353.48" dur="5.52">to enter into you like to get that meta</text><text start="7356.9" dur="4.44">perspectival Loop running that this is</text><text start="7359.0" dur="5.28">what I this is the great lesson I keep</text><text start="7361.34" dur="5.7">getting from Socrates is like</text><text start="7364.28" dur="4.74">like I I get kind of pissed when people</text><text start="7367.04" dur="3.659">talk about finding themselves as if</text><text start="7369.02" dur="4.56">there&apos;s something ins if I just go deep</text><text start="7370.699" dur="4.92">enough inside I&apos;ll find the magic kernel</text><text start="7373.58" dur="6.0">that is shows how wonderful I really am</text><text start="7375.619" dur="5.461">right where where where but we&apos;re</text><text start="7379.58" dur="2.76">talking what we&apos;re in fact trying to do</text><text start="7381.08" dur="3.72">right now</text><text start="7382.34" dur="4.98">right the more I</text><text start="7384.8" dur="4.02">can see through your eyes</text><text start="7387.32" dur="3.66">and I&apos;m drawn to because you&apos;re a</text><text start="7388.82" dur="4.5">powerful thinker</text><text start="7390.98" dur="3.86">the more I can internalize that</text><text start="7393.32" dur="3.96">I think the more I&apos;ll understand myself</text><text start="7394.84" dur="6.64">but the more I can also afford you doing</text><text start="7397.28" dur="7.379">that and then that means that we</text><text start="7401.48" dur="4.739">have an ability right to like it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="7404.659" dur="4.261">just you know this it doesn&apos;t just go up</text><text start="7406.219" dur="5.701">linearly our ability to cooperate and</text><text start="7408.92" dur="6.42">coordinate goes up exponentially</text><text start="7411.92" dur="7.14">okay so a Folly in this that I want to</text><text start="7415.34" dur="6.299">speak to is</text><text start="7419.06" dur="5.099">there&apos;s the capacity to take other</text><text start="7421.639" dur="3.841">people&apos;s perspectives seek to be able to</text><text start="7424.159" dur="2.641">steal management seek to be able to</text><text start="7425.48" dur="3.6">communicate it so well that they have</text><text start="7426.8" dur="4.439">nothing to add that is totally</text><text start="7429.08" dur="3.9">performative it&apos;s rhetorical and it</text><text start="7431.239" dur="3.721">doesn&apos;t have any real interiority and</text><text start="7432.98" dur="5.46">it&apos;s super dangerous and</text><text start="7434.96" dur="5.94">um you know we&apos;ll see lawyers who are</text><text start="7438.44" dur="4.32">trained to be able to defend either side</text><text start="7440.9" dur="3.299">regardless of believing in it just</text><text start="7442.76" dur="4.62">through kind of rhetorical capability</text><text start="7444.199" dur="5.52">and there&apos;s an attraction to meta</text><text start="7447.38" dur="3.839">paradigmatic work that an ego can have</text><text start="7449.719" dur="4.261">because you sound really smart</text><text start="7451.219" dur="5.581">yeah and you can win debates by always</text><text start="7453.98" dur="7.08">including in transcending and whatever</text><text start="7456.8" dur="6.06">um and but it&apos;s devoid of the actual</text><text start="7461.06" dur="4.679">give a that is the motive that I&apos;m</text><text start="7462.86" dur="4.379">interested in yes which is</text><text start="7465.739" dur="3.301">not just wanting to be able to say what</text><text start="7467.239" dur="3.9">the other person would say but be able</text><text start="7469.04" dur="3.72">to actually experience</text><text start="7471.139" dur="3.181">what it&apos;s like to be in their shoes</text><text start="7472.76" dur="3.419">deeply enough you can&apos;t actually</text><text start="7474.32" dur="4.26">separate yourself later</text><text start="7476.179" dur="4.201">excellent and of course again back to</text><text start="7478.58" dur="5.22">the socratic Paradigm you describe</text><text start="7480.38" dur="5.16">Socrates mean combatants the sophist and</text><text start="7483.8" dur="3.899">they prided themselves on that that they</text><text start="7485.54" dur="4.44">could make any argument win and for me</text><text start="7487.699" dur="4.081">they are they&apos;re they were they&apos;re</text><text start="7489.98" dur="3.36">consummate artists because the</text><text start="7491.78" dur="4.74">truth was irrelevant all that mattered</text><text start="7493.34" dur="6.259">was making some Salient to win now I</text><text start="7496.52" dur="3.079">this is interesting</text><text start="7501.44" dur="3.96">I want people who give a about</text><text start="7503.96" dur="4.199">truth</text><text start="7505.4" dur="5.219">but who are pretty humble in their idea</text><text start="7508.159" dur="4.141">of what true means yes both in terms of</text><text start="7510.619" dur="2.881">the complexity of epistemology and</text><text start="7512.3" dur="3.54">ontology</text><text start="7513.5" dur="3.42">and who give a about good and</text><text start="7515.84" dur="3.18">beautiful</text><text start="7516.92" dur="5.219">and about just in a very real</text><text start="7519.02" dur="5.88">non-cognitive sense the actual</text><text start="7522.139" dur="5.421">experience of other sentient that&apos;s</text><text start="7524.9" dur="5.58">exactly what I was going yeah because</text><text start="7527.56" dur="5.139">Socrates of course famously argued that</text><text start="7530.48" dur="3.6">his the core of his wisdom wins it was</text><text start="7532.699" dur="4.141">that he came to know what he did not</text><text start="7534.08" dur="6.96">know he had to learn it ignorance</text><text start="7536.84" dur="6.54">um but he also protests himself to be a</text><text start="7541.04" dur="6.36">lover so the way you can maintain the</text><text start="7543.38" dur="6.779">humility like if I ever claimed to</text><text start="7547.4" dur="6.18">know my partner the way I can know it</text><text start="7550.159" dur="5.761">like a chair right that&apos;s the end of my</text><text start="7553.58" dur="4.92">relationship right</text><text start="7555.92" dur="3.719">to be to be in and she&apos;s an astonishing</text><text start="7558.5" dur="5.159">person</text><text start="7559.639" dur="7.5">to be in love with her is to is to</text><text start="7563.659" dur="6.661">understand that I want to know</text><text start="7567.139" dur="5.58">I want I want to afford I want to</text><text start="7570.32" dur="4.5">internalize her I want to afford herself</text><text start="7572.719" dur="5.101">transcending through me she affords it</text><text start="7574.82" dur="5.16">for me but I never</text><text start="7577.82" dur="4.799">I never want to frame her as a problem</text><text start="7579.98" dur="5.759">that I&apos;ve grasped yeah she&apos;s always a</text><text start="7582.619" dur="5.821">mystery that will elude any attempt

dur="6.301">about how to tell the virtues that are</text><text start="7633.56" dur="4.74">real versus the ones that are signaled</text><text start="7635.48" dur="5.34">that I learned very very late in life</text><text start="7638.3" dur="5.7">the hard way and probably still missing</text><text start="7640.82" dur="6.299">things on but it&apos;s so simple</text><text start="7644.0" dur="7.5">like it was so simple that I realized</text><text start="7647.119" dur="7.5">I was psychologically in some</text><text start="7651.5" dur="5.04">way to have not recognized this no but I</text><text start="7654.619" dur="3.961">mean that seriously and it&apos;s my friend</text><text start="7656.54" dur="3.659">Zack Stein and many of you probably know</text><text start="7658.58" dur="4.079">introduced me to the psychological</text><text start="7660.199" dur="3.781">concept of selective inattention like</text><text start="7662.659" dur="4.101">places where you have a blind spot</text><text start="7663.98" dur="5.159">because it defends some psychological</text><text start="7666.76" dur="4.66">Frailty and I think</text><text start="7669.139" dur="4.801">um the untrustworthiness of other people</text><text start="7671.42" dur="4.56">was something I tried to turn a blind</text><text start="7673.94" dur="5.04">eye to as a survival strategy to believe</text><text start="7675.98" dur="5.1">in people in childhood and so and then</text><text start="7678.98" dur="4.32">just hold this Redemptive Focus that</text><text start="7681.08" dur="4.8">could make everybody trustworthy and you</text><text start="7683.3" dur="5.939">know whatever so</text><text start="7685.88" dur="5.12">um after having some experiences of</text><text start="7689.239" dur="4.5">really really trying to build trust</text><text start="7691.0" dur="4.119">where all of the indicators said that</text><text start="7693.739" dur="2.701">that was a dumb idea and not possible</text><text start="7695.119" dur="3.421">whatever</text><text start="7696.44" dur="5.52">um and finally giving up painfully with</text><text start="7698.54" dur="5.76">it I asked a friend who Diplomat and</text><text start="7701.96" dur="4.86">wise in this way how how the do you</text><text start="7704.3" dur="4.5">decide who you trust and he said</text><text start="7706.82" dur="3.299">something that was so obvious and like I</text><text start="7708.8" dur="2.64">couldn&apos;t believe that I had not done</text><text start="7710.119" dur="3.901">this and you guys all might think it&apos;s</text><text start="7711.44" dur="4.259">obvious because you went to school and</text><text start="7714.02" dur="3.9">just like learned who not to trust at</text><text start="7715.699" dur="4.141">school it&apos;s a place that I didn&apos;t learn</text><text start="7717.92" dur="3.84">but he said if they&apos;re an adult if</text><text start="7719.84" dur="6.24">they&apos;re not still young and developing</text><text start="7721.76" dur="6.54">if they&apos;re 30 40 56 years old</text><text start="7726.08" dur="3.559">um look at the relationships in their</text><text start="7728.3" dur="4.319">life that they&apos;ve had for a long time</text><text start="7729.639" dur="4.781">and if the kind of relationship you want</text><text start="7732.619" dur="2.881">to have is very different than the ones</text><text start="7734.42" dur="2.4">they have it&apos;s probably not going to</text><text start="7735.5" dur="2.58">happen you&apos;re probably not going to be</text><text start="7736.82" dur="2.94">the first one</text><text start="7738.08" dur="3.48">to have a very different relationship</text><text start="7739.76" dur="2.76">with them the existing relationships in</text><text start="7741.56" dur="3.96">their life that they&apos;re a common</text><text start="7742.52" dur="4.92">denominator of is a good sign because</text><text start="7745.52" dur="3.719">they might with it they might</text><text start="7747.44" dur="3.42">even themselves</text><text start="7749.239" dur="3.36">and then other people where it</text><text start="7750.86" dur="5.4">seems like they have these virtues</text><text start="7752.599" dur="5.1">long term that typically plays out right</text><text start="7756.26" dur="2.7">and so he&apos;s like look at the</text><text start="7757.699" dur="2.94">relationships that they&apos;ve had for a</text><text start="7758.96" dur="3.179">pretty long time and try to find the</text><text start="7760.639" dur="4.221">ones that aren&apos;t there anymore you know</text><text start="7762.139" dur="7.161">and just get a sense of it I was like</text><text start="7764.86" dur="6.4">duh and but it&apos;s amazing how</text><text start="7769.3" dur="4.899">simplifying of painful experience is</text><text start="7771.26" dur="4.859">that one heuristic can be</text><text start="7774.199" dur="4.381">and it&apos;s not absolute of course people</text><text start="7776.119" dur="4.201">can change and yeah</text><text start="7778.58" dur="5.76">yeah um</text><text start="7780.32" dur="6.06">yeah I try to tell my kids to at least</text><text start="7784.34" dur="3.66">learn about the family of somebody they</text><text start="7786.38" dur="3.12">want to enter a romantic relationship</text><text start="7788.0" dur="2.4">with</text><text start="7789.5" dur="3.239">um</text><text start="7790.4" dur="4.92">and I did that in this case And my</text><text start="7792.739" dur="4.44">partner&apos;s family they&apos;re amazing people</text><text start="7795.32" dur="4.68">it&apos;s it&apos;s like</text><text start="7797.179" dur="5.52">want to be around them it&apos;s just they&apos;re</text><text start="7800.0" dur="3.92">astonishing and and so</text><text start="7802.699" dur="6.301">um I think that&apos;s really good advice</text><text start="7803.92" dur="7.12">I&apos;ve I&apos;ve also adopted a heuristic and</text><text start="7809.0" dur="3.84">it again seems really</text><text start="7811.04" dur="4.34">maybe simplistic but I&apos;ve been finding</text><text start="7812.84" dur="2.54">it very valuable</text><text start="7816.8" dur="3.839">how often do I see somebody engaging in</text><text start="7819.139" dur="4.02">an act of self-correction that has</text><text start="7820.639" dur="5.04">long-term consequences for them</text><text start="7823.159" dur="3.54">that for me makes them more trustworthy</text><text start="7825.679" dur="4.02">for me</text><text start="7826.699" dur="6.121">because if they are willing to do that</text><text start="7829.699" dur="5.341">they they are willing to correct their</text><text start="7832.82" dur="3.899">behavior and they&apos;re also typically</text><text start="7835.04" dur="2.639">again it&apos;s a heuristic they&apos;re willing</text><text start="7836.719" dur="3.721">to listen</text><text start="7837.679" dur="5.52">and and that um</text><text start="7840.44" dur="4.62">that to me has been very valuable</text><text start="7843.199" dur="4.381">yeah I&apos;ll say the what I think is</text><text start="7845.06" dur="3.599">probably pretty close to identical and</text><text start="7847.58" dur="4.079">um</text><text start="7848.659" dur="4.741">way I&apos;ve been thinking about it is um</text><text start="7851.659" dur="3.721">as I was just mentioning I had a blind</text><text start="7853.4" dur="4.199">spot everybody has blind spots like</text><text start="7855.38" dur="4.219">pretty much by definition</text><text start="7857.599" dur="4.981">so a psychologically</text><text start="7859.599" dur="5.56">healthy person should be seeking their</text><text start="7862.58" dur="3.84">own blind spots right you should this is</text><text start="7865.159" dur="4.08">actually something that makes so little</text><text start="7866.42" dur="5.04">sense to me is why people in leadership</text><text start="7869.239" dur="4.021">positions in particular knowing the</text><text start="7871.46" dur="3.6">emperor has no clothes</text><text start="7873.26" dur="3.54">story and knowing that if you&apos;re in a</text><text start="7875.06" dur="3.48">leadership position people will</text><text start="7876.8" dur="3.359">you in the s menu and whatever like why</text><text start="7878.54" dur="4.38">people in leadership positions aren&apos;t</text><text start="7880.159" dur="4.261">scared as that they have blind</text><text start="7882.92" dur="3.42">spots that are damaging things they care</text><text start="7884.42" dur="3.54">about that nobody&apos;s telling them like</text><text start="7886.34" dur="3.42">I&apos;m scared of that I&apos;m like I don&apos;t</text><text start="7887.96" dur="3.0">I don&apos;t want to be messing up stuff I</text><text start="7889.76" dur="3.24">care about because I don&apos;t know</text><text start="7890.96" dur="4.02">so I&apos;m actively trying to get people</text><text start="7893.0" dur="4.38">that are really honest who will tell me</text><text start="7894.98" dur="5.04">those things and I&apos;m still knowing that</text><text start="7897.38" dur="4.14">you know it&apos;s a challenging thing</text><text start="7900.02" dur="2.76">so</text><text start="7901.52" dur="3.84">um blind spots aren&apos;t the problem but</text><text start="7902.78" dur="4.98">defended blind spots and so one of the</text><text start="7905.36" dur="6.299">things that and this is kind of very</text><text start="7907.76" dur="5.16">cluster B in particular is ideally I&apos;m</text><text start="7911.659" dur="3.421">interested in people who are actively</text><text start="7912.92" dur="4.92">seeking their blind spots next is at</text><text start="7915.08" dur="4.92">least to a receptive</text><text start="7917.84" dur="3.6">but if someone has defended blind spots</text><text start="7920.0" dur="4.199">meaning they get mad at you for pointing</text><text start="7921.44" dur="5.58">it out or at most give you some kind of</text><text start="7924.199" dur="4.801">like performative thank you and then</text><text start="7927.02" dur="4.199">push you away or something</text><text start="7929.0" dur="4.34">um and they&apos;re not what specifically not</text><text start="7931.219" dur="5.101">willing to be held accountable to change</text><text start="7933.34" dur="4.54">that&apos;s a sign that I probably don&apos;t want</text><text start="7936.32" dur="3.839">to work that closely</text><text start="7937.88" dur="4.14">yeah you probably know that as people go</text><text start="7940.159" dur="3.721">up the hierarchy too their ability to</text><text start="7942.02" dur="4.02">take the perspective of others drops</text><text start="7943.88" dur="4.319">down significantly</text><text start="7946.04" dur="4.8">um which may exacerbate the very thing</text><text start="7948.199" dur="5.581">uh you&apos;re talking about I I I&apos;m</text><text start="7950.84" dur="5.64">concerned about that issue too a lot and</text><text start="7953.78" dur="5.879">you know in even before whatever this is</text><text start="7956.48" dur="4.02">even as a professor I was concerned with</text><text start="7959.659" dur="2.52">that</text><text start="7960.5" dur="4.139">um so can we go back to your virtue</text><text start="7962.179" dur="4.621">question sure will you reframe it again</text><text start="7964.639" dur="5.821">what are the set of Virtues that yeah</text><text start="7966.8" dur="6.439">what so I would say the virtue and the</text><text start="7970.46" dur="5.699">virtuosity that allows one to reliably</text><text start="7973.239" dur="5.261">regularly and reliably discern</text><text start="7976.159" dur="6.901">uh bullshitting from lying</text><text start="7978.5" dur="8.099">so that people can reorient towards the</text><text start="7983.06" dur="6.98">kinds of connections that actually do</text><text start="7986.599" dur="3.441">sustain meaning in life</text><text start="7995.38" dur="7.0">I I grew up watching krishnamurti so I</text><text start="7999.26" dur="4.439">had just such a affection for him but I</text><text start="8002.38" dur="2.88">remember talking to other people who</text><text start="8003.699" dur="3.121">didn&apos;t grow up with that affection and</text><text start="8005.26" dur="4.319">they&apos;re like why is that dude pissed off</text><text start="8006.82" dur="4.859">all the time and</text><text start="8009.579" dur="4.08">because he would start us talking he&apos;d</text><text start="8011.679" dur="5.221">be like can we take this serious can we</text><text start="8013.659" dur="6.181">be very serious about this thing and</text><text start="8016.9" dur="4.739">but he was trying to say like how do we</text><text start="8019.84" dur="3.18">actually solve human conflict and I</text><text start="8021.639" dur="2.52">don&apos;t want to be just saying this as</text><text start="8023.02" dur="2.94">entertainment and you go home and</text><text start="8024.159" dur="3.241">nothing changes like do you also</text><text start="8025.96" dur="3.179">give a about solving human conflict</text><text start="8027.4" dur="3.54">and the meaningfulness of life so</text><text start="8029.139" dur="3.6">similar to the thing I said about her</text><text start="8030.94" dur="3.719">parents like take the</text><text start="8032.739" dur="3.601">meaningfulness of your kids life more</text><text start="8034.659" dur="3.96">seriously but then also have less</text><text start="8036.34" dur="3.42">certainty that you know how which means</text><text start="8038.619" dur="2.641">that you have to be engaged in the</text><text start="8039.76" dur="5.0">process with them</text><text start="8041.26" dur="3.5">um it seems like</text><text start="8044.94" dur="7.42">to the degree that someone</text><text start="8048.579" dur="6.421">actually does take</text><text start="8052.36" dur="5.1">life as meaningful in their own life is</text><text start="8055.0" dur="7.139">Meaningful that&apos;s a pretty strong</text><text start="8057.46" dur="7.86">resilience to like it&apos;s it&apos;s um</text><text start="8062.139" dur="5.161">you know repellent right because it&apos;s</text><text start="8065.32" dur="4.44">pretty someone has this relevance filter</text><text start="8067.3" dur="5.279">of is reality happening because meaning</text><text start="8069.76" dur="5.04">can&apos;t be detached from reality right and</text><text start="8072.579" dur="4.201">if I don&apos;t get the sense of realities</text><text start="8074.8" dur="4.5">happening then I want to kind of quickly</text><text start="8076.78" dur="5.04">move through that that seems to be the</text><text start="8079.3" dur="4.2">most fundamental one to me is actually</text><text start="8081.82" dur="2.339">like a</text><text start="8083.5" dur="2.639">um</text><text start="8084.159" dur="4.02">I mean obviously there are epistemic</text><text start="8086.139" dur="3.301">skills obviously there are psychological</text><text start="8088.179" dur="2.52">insights to see if people are</text><text start="8089.44" dur="3.719">bullshitting like we just pointed out</text><text start="8090.699" dur="4.92">but it seems like the most</text><text start="8093.159" dur="4.681">uh and there&apos;s obviously a mindfulness</text><text start="8095.619" dur="4.201">to even be paying attention am I just</text><text start="8097.84" dur="3.48">being entranced and entertained or not</text><text start="8099.82" dur="2.7">to like I don&apos;t want to take all those</text><text start="8101.32" dur="5.04">for granted</text><text start="8102.52" dur="5.34">but the depth of care about how each of</text><text start="8106.36" dur="3.42">the moments of our life are being</text><text start="8107.86" dur="4.739">invested seems to be the heart of it</text><text start="8109.78" dur="7.76">motivationally what do you think</text><text start="8112.599" dur="4.941">yeah I mean the the knowing the the</text><text start="8117.76" dur="4.319">that&apos;s what I meant about loving wisely</text><text start="8119.679" dur="4.861">knowing how to care</text><text start="8122.079" dur="5.221">properly proportionally</text><text start="8124.54" dur="3.599">um seems to be the key thing</text><text start="8127.3" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="8128.139" dur="4.921">and and and and so two two things come</text><text start="8130.78" dur="3.48">up for me one is first of all what you</text><text start="8133.06" dur="4.86">just the first thing you said about</text><text start="8134.26" dur="6.359">there&apos;s a deep connection between</text><text start="8137.92" dur="4.44">meaning at least how I&apos;m using it I</text><text start="8140.619" dur="3.96">think it&apos;s how you&apos;re using it and the</text><text start="8142.36" dur="3.2">connectedness to reality</text><text start="8144.579" dur="4.861">um</text><text start="8145.56" dur="7.78">and part of the problem is that that is</text><text start="8149.44" dur="7.38">not sort of the default mode in which</text><text start="8153.34" dur="3.48">people understand meaning</text><text start="8157.78" dur="4.859">most people we know there&apos;s good</text><text start="8160.42" dur="4.319">research to show that people conf that</text><text start="8162.639" dur="2.94">these three things are different</text><text start="8164.739" dur="3.021">um</text><text start="8165.579" dur="4.14">wealth and socioeconomic status</text><text start="8167.76" dur="3.819">subjective well-being and meaning in</text><text start="8169.719" dur="3.9">life and our culture has collapsed them</text><text start="8171.579" dur="3.12">all into one blob</text><text start="8173.619" dur="1.62">right</text><text start="8174.699" dur="4.281">um</text><text start="8175.239" dur="5.701">wealth only contributes to improved</text><text start="8178.98" dur="3.46">subjective well-being sort of how good</text><text start="8180.94" dur="4.139">you feel I&apos;m feeling pretty good that&apos;s</text><text start="8182.44" dur="4.38">subjective well-being and wealth it only</text><text start="8185.079" dur="3.961">makes a significant difference to that</text><text start="8186.82" dur="4.14">when you get out of poverty once you&apos;re</text><text start="8189.04" dur="3.479">out of poverty you have to have huge</text><text start="8190.96" dur="3.599">increases in wealth to make minor</text><text start="8192.519" dur="5.101">differences in subjective well-being so</text><text start="8194.559" dur="4.861">it&apos;s actually irrational to be primarily</text><text start="8197.62" dur="3.599">wealth driven</text><text start="8199.42" dur="3.96">the problem is so those two things are</text><text start="8201.219" dur="3.96">confused and then

remember</text><text start="8494.08" dur="5.819">I was like 16 or 17 having this</text><text start="8497.62" dur="3.48">experience where I was I was meditating</text><text start="8499.899" dur="2.521">and then I opened my eyes and I was</text><text start="8501.1" dur="5.7">watching the sunset in this beautiful</text><text start="8502.42" dur="5.88">area and I was just kind of in awe right</text><text start="8506.8" dur="4.679">kind of a everybody&apos;s had that</text><text start="8508.3" dur="4.98">experience but in awe at the beauty of</text><text start="8511.479" dur="3.481">this planet and nature in the sky and</text><text start="8513.28" dur="4.74">everything</text><text start="8514.96" dur="5.3">and then I had this self-reflection of</text><text start="8518.02" dur="2.24">like</text><text start="8520.84" dur="4.5">if I have the choice as some</text><text start="8523.26" dur="4.78">unincarnated spirit</text><text start="8525.34" dur="4.2">uh if I had the choice to Incarnate and</text><text start="8528.04" dur="3.54">experience every difficulty I have ever</text><text start="8529.54" dur="3.779">experienced to just have this one moment</text><text start="8531.58" dur="3.779">I would totally do it</text><text start="8533.319" dur="2.941">just for this one moment as opposed to</text><text start="8535.359" dur="4.441">nothing</text><text start="8536.26" dur="5.52">right like the it&apos;s infinitely valuable</text><text start="8539.8" dur="4.86">basically infinitely precious and like</text><text start="8541.78" dur="5.22">thought totally like I I the other</text><text start="8544.66" dur="5.22">things don&apos;t matter at all Rel</text><text start="8547.0" dur="4.979">ative to the depth of experience and</text><text start="8549.88" dur="4.2">then I realized that I&apos;ve had thousands</text><text start="8551.979" dur="3.901">of experiences for which I would</text><text start="8554.08" dur="3.56">incarnate an entire life just for that</text><text start="8555.88" dur="3.9">one experience</text><text start="8557.64" dur="4.44">and then when I really reflected on that</text><text start="8559.78" dur="2.3">I&apos;m like</text><text start="8563.859" dur="5.301">the the ongoing what&apos;s in it for me</text><text start="8566.92" dur="6.24">shifts</text><text start="8569.16" dur="6.4">right and then there&apos;s a sense of like I</text><text start="8573.16" dur="4.86">have already experienced many many lives</text><text start="8575.56" dur="4.86">worthy of living</text><text start="8578.02" dur="5.52">and the fact that more stuff keeps</text><text start="8580.42" dur="6.66">happening is just gravy and is awesome</text><text start="8583.54" dur="5.76">and I appreciate it but all future life</text><text start="8587.08" dur="3.66">is not insured to have that yet and not</text><text start="8589.3" dur="2.58">everyone else has had as much fortune</text><text start="8590.74" dur="4.38">and I can actually do something about</text><text start="8591.88" dur="5.58">that not just my own experience and so</text><text start="8595.12" dur="4.319">with that recognition came a kind of</text><text start="8597.46" dur="3.54">depth of gratitude that comes a kind of</text><text start="8599.439" dur="6.481">obligation</text><text start="8601.0" dur="7.979">to other sentient experience yeah</text><text start="8605.92" dur="6.74">and I I find that like everyone I trust</text><text start="8608.979" dur="3.681">the most has had an experience like that</text><text start="8613.56" dur="6.52">and until somebody has the what&apos;s in it</text><text start="8617.979" dur="4.141">for me hungry ghost thing creates some</text><text

I thought it was really insightful</text><text start="8947.56" dur="3.72">because</text><text start="8949.3" dur="4.32">the choices we make will have some</text><text start="8951.28"

dur="5.101">do that right excellent</text><text start="8962.92" dur="4.86">um yeah it&apos;s interesting the same Rabbi</text><text start="8965.92" dur="4.38">friend in our like second

dur="4.92">which was</text><text start="8974.92" dur="4.8">um if you haven&apos;t gone into devastating</text><text start="8978.16" dur="3.48">tragedy and then come out on the other</text><text start="8979.72" dur="3.36">side of it no idea what&apos;s going to</text><text start="8981.64" dur="3.719">happen to you when it does happen</text><text start="8983.08" dur="6.42">and</text><text start="8985.359" dur="7.261">so it&apos;s it&apos;s interesting because I think</text><text start="8989.5" dur="4.5">only if someone has experienced the</text><text start="8992.62" dur="3.0">beauty of the world enough that it&apos;s</text><text start="8994.0" dur="4.319">both sacred and they&apos;re committed to it</text><text start="8995.62" dur="4.26">for everyone else and they feel full</text><text start="8998.319" dur="3.181">which doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t want and</text><text start="8999.88" dur="2.88">enjoy more just means they don&apos;t need it</text><text start="9001.5" dur="5.1">in the same way</text><text start="9002.76" dur="6.719">and only if someone has gone through</text><text start="9006.6" dur="5.58">saying well one hard thing&apos;s enough that</text><text start="9009.479" dur="6.181">they&apos;re kind of character emerges but</text><text start="9012.18" dur="5.82">also ideally things that devastate their</text><text start="9015.66" dur="4.739">previous sense of self in world view so</text><text start="9018.0" dur="4.859">there is then some new</text><text start="9020.399" dur="6.441">self that has to emerge</text><text start="9022.859" dur="3.981">but then another one I would add is</text><text start="9027.12" dur="5.16">um trauma healing is really important</text><text start="9030.12" dur="4.26">because you can</text><text start="9032.28" dur="3.78">get resilience gifts and you can get</text><text start="9034.38" dur="3.12">philosophic insights and you can get</text><text start="9036.06" dur="3.54">strength from going through things and</text><text start="9037.5" dur="5.52">still be left with a shrapnel</text><text start="9039.6" dur="4.86">and it has an effect and one of the</text><text start="9043.02" dur="3.839">things that I&apos;ve noticed in terms of</text><text start="9044.46" dur="4.38">people&apos;s fear of death is that they&apos;re</text><text start="9046.859" dur="3.801">unresolved trauma gets projected into</text><text start="9048.84" dur="4.26">the unknown</text><text start="9050.66" dur="4.72">and that to the degree there&apos;s a bunch</text><text start="9053.1" dur="4.02">of unresolved trauma then death and the</text><text start="9055.38" dur="4.979">dark and the unknown are scary because</text><text start="9057.12" dur="4.739">my again it&apos;s that what seems true is</text><text start="9060.359" dur="2.641">that which resonates with what it feels</text><text start="9061.859" dur="3.421">like inside</text><text start="9063.0" dur="4.26">and I can&apos;t be really good friends with</text><text start="9065.28" dur="4.44">the unknown if my experience of the</text><text start="9067.26" dur="4.32">known actually feels overwhelmingly</text><text start="9069.72" dur="3.84">traumatic right because that&apos;s what gets</text><text start="9071.58" dur="3.54">projected so I think</text><text start="9073.56" dur="3.48">having trauma and getting through it</text><text start="9075.12" dur="3.96">working through the way that trauma</text><text start="9077.04" dur="3.54">lives inside of us being

dur="3.481">I think that was beautiful and well said</text><text start="9094.0" dur="2.38">[Music]</text><text start="9094.38" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="9098.22" dur="6.48">yeah I I I I like

a sense in which</text><text start="9134.34" dur="4.559">that can provoke people but I find that</text><text start="9136.5" dur="4.979">those like when I do that it&apos;s it</text><text start="9138.899" dur="6.0">doesn&apos;t do much right because it&apos;s sub</text><text start="9141.479" dur="6.541">semantic yeah yes exactly exactly and</text><text start="9144.899" dur="6.0">and that&apos;s exactly the point</text><text start="9148.02" dur="4.799">well back to</text><text start="9150.899" dur="5.04">like you know somebody who&apos;s Pro</text><text start="9152.819"

a</text><text start="9161.46" dur="4.56">funeral</text><text start="9162.18" dur="6.48">because the people who shut up</text><text start="9166.02" dur="4.68">and sit beside the person who&apos;s

it&apos;s really hard for people to shut</text><text start="9178.26" dur="4.86">up</text><text start="9179.76" dur="5.099">and really do that and I think it&apos;s I</text><text start="9183.12" dur="3.239">hadn&apos;t put this together but I think</text><text start="9184.859" dur="3.241">it&apos;s because they&apos;re doing exactly</text><text start="9186.359" dur="5.521">they&apos;re

that&apos;s</text><text start="9217.8" dur="3.42">true and even if that&apos;s where the person</text><text start="9219.18" dur="3.96">will inevitably come</text><text start="9221.22" dur="4.74">either that means that person has never</text><text start="9223.14" dur="4.259">been through it or it means that they</text><text start="9225.96" dur="2.82">well they&apos;ve never been through it right</text><text start="9227.399" dur="3.721">like they went into it couldn&apos;t deal</text><text start="9228.78" dur="4.619">with it and so there&apos;s a bypass of their</text><text

right if someone is going to</text><text start="9241.92" dur="4.38">a specially lead anything</text><text start="9244.319" dur="4.321">which also means lead people who will go</text><text

people</text><text start="9261.3" dur="3.84">have any virtue or virtuosity in the</text><text start="9263.28" dur="3.0">non-propositional that&apos;s where that&apos;s</text><text start="9265.14" dur="3.54">the kind of situation where it really</text><text start="9266.28" dur="4.8">shows itself right that that the</text><text start="9268.68" dur="3.9">capacity for comportment</text><text

dur="3.6">comforting in those kinds of situations</text><text start="9276.479" dur="4.201">and then I wonder but I wonder about</text><text start="9278.34" dur="3.9">what you just said also because there&apos;s</text><text start="9280.68" dur="3.6">similarities right between grief and</text><text start="9282.24" dur="3.72">wonder wonder makes you call your world</text><text start="9284.28"

dur="5.759">obviously if someone is</text><text start="9299.76" dur="4.26">not capable of being with ecstasy in</text><text start="9302.819" dur="2.521">themselves because of repression or</text><text

dur="3.72">psychological health and trustworthiness</text><text start="9326.28" dur="3.36">so now that we&apos;re running out of time</text><text start="9328.02" dur="4.58">I&apos;ll ask you a question that should take</text><text start="9329.64" dur="2.96">about four hours to answer</text><text start="9332.7" dur="6.239">which is the the place where people had</text><text start="9336.66"

the</text><text start="9345.6" dur="5.58">data on the nuns and so forth these are</text><text start="9348.18" dur="4.44">not viable homes for the new models and</text><text start="9351.18" dur="2.82">often not because they don&apos;t believe in</text><text start="9352.62" dur="3.72">the propositions it&apos;s because they</text><text start="9354.0" dur="5.16">regard what is happening in

and the ten thousand</text><text start="9602.88" dur="4.439">things it was saying they can dance</text><text start="9605.16" dur="3.48">together and basically the study of the</text><text start="9607.319" dur="2.941">ten thousand things is what I would</text><text start="9608.64" dur="3.96">think of as science and kind of</text><text start="9610.26" dur="6.3">pharmacological

dur="4.2">and yet it&apos;s not worthless and it</text><text start="9621.72" dur="2.759">doesn&apos;t have to obscure the Dow but it</text><text start="9623.34" dur="3.479">usually does</text><text start="9624.479" dur="4.081">and so how does somebody relate to the</text><text start="9626.819" dur="3.481">fact that the limit there&apos;s like a</text><text start="9628.56" dur="3.24">there&apos;s a con there&apos;s something wrong in</text><text start="9630.3" dur="3.179">the leibnizian concept of the limit</text><text start="9631.8" dur="3.36">which is when you factor that that</text><text start="9633.479" dur="4.141">algorithm has to process on some</text><text start="9635.16" dur="4.86">computational substrate that takes time</text><text start="9637.62" dur="3.779">to get to Infinity

dur="4.32">and so</text><text start="9646.62" dur="3.48">whether you think of it that way or you</text><text start="9648.42" dur="3.479">think of the kind of girdles theorem or</text><text start="9650.1" dur="4.14">tarsky&apos;s theorem of it there is a</text><text start="9651.899" dur="5.521">binding to the ontologically unknowable</text><text start="9654.24" dur="5.46">and sacredness being bound there</text><text start="9657.42" dur="5.16">which is also has to be at the core of</text><text start="9659.7" dur="5.04">governance Theory because what are you</text><text start="9662.58" dur="4.2">optimizing for the the Dow that is</text><text start="9664.74" dur="4.44">nameable is not the Eternal Dao</text><text start="9666.78" dur="7.38">the metric set that is optimizable is</text><text start="9669.18" dur="7.679">not worth optimizing for and so</text><text start="9674.16" dur="5.34">that really up AI governance ideas</text><text start="9676.859" dur="4.021">as it

unknowable</text><text start="9692.28" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="9694.62" dur="4.26">and so there&apos;s a way that we can relate</text><text start="9697.56" dur="4.379">to</text><text

for that</text><text start="9705.96" dur="3.24">there&apos;s a way that we can relate to that</text><text start="9707.52" dur="3.9">that can actually sensitize us to the</text><text start="9709.2" dur="4.08">Dao rather than desensitize us where we</text><text start="9711.42" dur="3.42">actually become aware of how</text><text start="9713.28" dur="3.24">complex and orderly and profound</text><text start="9714.84" dur="3.0">everything is without thinking that our</text><text start="9716.52" dur="4.68">knowledge that ever converges on</text><text start="9717.84" dur="6.0">everything so we stay completely bound</text><text start="9721.2" dur="5.22">to the unknowable and we actually just</text><text start="9723.84" dur="4.32">get greater sense of the depth of what</text><text start="9726.42" dur="2.7">that means through the extent of the</text><text start="9728.16" dur="4.199">novel</text><text start="9729.12" dur="6.3">and in that way the ten thousand things</text><text start="9732.359" dur="4.861">in the Dow can dance and it&apos;s kind of in</text><text start="9735.42" dur="4.019">that right so when we talk about</text><text start="9737.22" dur="3.599">religion there&apos;s a relationship to the</text><text start="9739.439" dur="2.701">unknowable</text><text start="9740.819" dur="3.0">but it&apos;s not separate from the</text><text

of</text><text start="9752.04" dur="3.72">education and culture and everything</text><text start="9753.78" dur="4.74">being that develops that it&apos;s obviously</text><text start="9755.76"
