dur="4.38">well so this is interesting I think this</text><text start="31.5" dur="5.34">is obviously that&apos;s something about the</text><text start="33.899" dur="4.921">way the brain the neurophysiology and</text><text start="36.84" dur="3.66">psyche together are being conditioned by</text><text start="38.82" dur="4.259">Tech and culture and the economy</text><text start="40.5" dur="5.28">together and obviously we&apos;re looking</text><text start="43.079" dur="5.401">very specifically at things like</text><text start="45.78" dur="4.74">the way that Facebook and platforms like</text><text start="48.48" dur="5.399">that trying to optimize time on site and</text><text start="50.52" dur="5.219">engagement identify the the stickiest</text><text start="53.879" dur="3.061">things keep people from bouncing and</text><text start="55.739" dur="2.761">those happen to be the limbically</text><text start="56.94" dur="4.799">hijacking things</text><text

overcome and</text><text start="78.18" dur="2.939">that we have to work with here and I</text><text start="79.5" dur="3.18">think this goes to the topic you&apos;re</text><text start="81.119" dur="3.741">asking of like</text><text start="82.68" dur="2.18">foreign</text><text start="85.74" dur="3.84">thinking about Grand narratives just in</text><text start="88.14" dur="2.94">general being able to think about the</text><text start="89.58" dur="3.6">whole well enough that we can think</text><text start="91.08" dur="4.32">about Solutions even to parts that don&apos;t</text><text start="93.18" dur="5.46">mess up other things the minimum</text><text start="95.4" dur="5.16">required complexity of just reality is</text><text start="98.64" dur="5.159">such that we do have to recondition</text><text start="100.56" dur="5.64">ourselves to be able to uh</text><text start="103.799" dur="5.161">seek instantaneous certainty and</text><text start="106.2" dur="4.919">instantaneous Solutions less and be able</text><text start="108.96" dur="4.199">to take the time to go deep enough in</text><text start="111.119" dur="3.841">the thing you really get the insights of</text><text start="113.159" dur="4.681">what the many different causes are not a</text><text start="114.96" dur="5.64">singular cause is that a skill like</text><text start="117.84" dur="5.0">meditation or how does someone develop</text><text start="120.6" dur="2.24">that</text><text start="124.88" dur="3.28">yeah I think</text><text start="127.259" dur="3.961">um</text><text start="128.16" dur="5.04">you know when we&apos;re talking about the</text><text start="131.22" dur="4.08">social media thing and obviously this is</text><text start="133.2" dur="4.08">not only social media there are</text><text start="135.3" dur="3.78">different kinds of reward circuits this</text><text start="137.28" dur="3.36">is kind of also why it&apos;s interesting to</text><text start="139.08" dur="4.08">think about it in terms of brain and</text><text start="140.64" dur="4.86">evolutionary biology versus conditioning</text><text start="143.16" dur="3.659">there are kind of one marshmallow reward</text><text start="145.5" dur="5.459">circuits and there are two marshmallow</text><text start="146.819" dur="6.301">reward circuits and the and also people</text><text start="150.959" dur="7.5">know the two marshmallow experiment</text><text start="153.12" dur="7.5">um the one marshmallow reward circuits</text><text start="158.459" dur="3.601">when you have an economy that makes a</text><text start="160.62" dur="3.0">lot of those available which Evolution</text><text start="162.06" dur="3.899">didn&apos;t make a lot of one marshmallow</text><text start="163.62" dur="4.619">reward circuits available</text><text start="165.959" dur="4.261">um typically you had to actually perform</text><text start="168.239" dur="4.5">evolutionarily relevant work to get</text><text start="170.22" dur="4.019">rewards of various kinds and one of the</text><text start="172.739" dur="4.321">things that we&apos;ve been able to do in</text><text start="174.239" dur="5.341">that specifically economics has</text><text start="177.06" dur="4.8">incentivized is being able to</text><text start="179.58" dur="4.439">take the thing that there&apos;s a</text><text start="181.86" dur="3.659">evolutionary reward attached to and</text><text start="184.019" dur="3.061">strip it from the thing the work that</text><text start="185.519" dur="3.421">you would have to do to get it to make</text><text start="187.08" dur="3.78">something that sells better that&apos;s what</text><text start="188.94" dur="5.159">the supply side is the supply side is</text><text start="190.86" dur="4.14">incentivized to drive Demand right and</text><text start="194.099" dur="3.42">so</text><text start="195.0" dur="5.28">we&apos;ve talked about this before of like</text><text start="197.519" dur="4.921">what fast food is to food I didn&apos;t have</text><text start="200.28" dur="3.959">to under gather or whatever and I just</text><text start="202.44" dur="4.079">get a concentration of salt fat and</text><text start="204.239" dur="4.801">sugar with maximum palatability stripped</text><text start="206.519" dur="5.22">of fiber and micronutrients so it hits</text><text start="209.04" dur="5.1">all of the dopaminergic you know reward</text><text start="211.739" dur="4.14">centers but neither has nutrients in it</text><text start="214.14" dur="4.08">nor did it actually require any</text><text start="215.879" dur="4.561">evolutionary activity of my body right</text><text start="218.22" dur="4.079">and that&apos;s pretty much the same thing</text><text start="220.44" dur="3.96">that porn is to actual sex which</text><text start="222.299" dur="4.681">involves intimacy and relationship and</text><text start="224.4" dur="4.02">you know lots of things like that so</text><text start="226.98" dur="6.06">we&apos;re getting the pain we&apos;re getting the</text><text start="228.42" dur="6.78">payoffs without the work in our culture</text><text start="233.04" dur="5.339">without the work and without the actual</text><text start="235.2" dur="5.34">even deeper nutrients right without the</text><text start="238.379" dur="4.381">the deeper fulfillers so if I&apos;m hungry</text><text start="240.54" dur="4.38">and I crave McDonald&apos;s there&apos;s this</text><text start="242.76" dur="4.14">fascinating thing where people who die</text><text start="244.92" dur="3.78">of diseases of obesity are actually also</text><text start="246.9" dur="3.36">dying of certain types of micronutrient</text><text start="248.7" dur="3.78">starvation</text><text start="250.26" dur="4.32">because every time they eat more stuff</text><text start="252.48" dur="3.539">and they get filled with calories and</text><text start="254.58" dur="3.42">micronutrients they&apos;re actually not</text><text start="256.019" dur="5.041">getting trace minerals they&apos;re not</text><text start="258.0" dur="4.8">getting phytonutrients and so then the</text><text start="261.06" dur="3.9">hunger is even deeper it&apos;s not a real</text><text start="262.8" dur="4.32">satisfier right it&apos;s a pseudo satisfier</text><text start="264.96" dur="3.66">so not only are they not doing the work</text><text start="267.12" dur="3.9">they&apos;re also not getting the deeper</text><text start="268.62" dur="3.78">thing that the the Salt Fat sugar was</text><text start="271.02" dur="3.84">evolutionarily bound to the other</text><text start="272.4" dur="4.32">micronutrients that were needed and the</text><text start="274.86" dur="3.54">same thing in terms of</text><text start="276.72" dur="3.24">people don&apos;t get a sense of deep</text><text start="278.4" dur="3.359">intimacy and connection and the</text><text start="279.96" dur="3.12">meaningfulness of life from porn that</text><text start="281.759" dur="4.081">they would from an actual intimate</text><text start="283.08" dur="4.44">relationship and they don&apos;t get it from</text><text start="285.84" dur="4.02">social media that they would from real</text><text start="287.52" dur="5.04">friendships and the real friendships</text><text start="289.86" dur="5.279">mean I can&apos;t just be an and then</text><text start="292.56" dur="4.079">bail I actually have to work through all</text><text start="295.139" dur="2.941">the human conflict which means I have to</text><text start="296.639" dur="2.641">look at how I contributed to it which</text><text start="298.08" dur="4.08">means I have to become a better person</text><text start="299.28" dur="5.82">but it&apos;s hard bringing it back to the</text><text start="302.16" dur="4.14">original question in ancestral times we</text><text start="305.1" dur="3.18">would have been sitting around a</text><text start="306.3" dur="6.179">campfire hashing out</text><text start="308.28" dur="7.44">the complex problem that we faced and</text><text start="312.479" dur="6.0">so our brain power wasn&apos;t a limiter</text><text start="315.72" dur="5.24">there but what&apos;s happening now is two</text><text start="318.479" dur="6.72">things number one the situation is</text><text start="320.96" dur="7.66">unbelievably complex and it can only be</text><text start="325.199" dur="6.0">understood in a individual mind you</text><text start="328.62" dur="5.639">can&apos;t get a climate expert an energy</text><text start="331.199" dur="6.06">expert an AI expert and a psychologist</text><text start="334.259" dur="5.16">in a room and each of them opine on</text><text start="337.259" dur="3.961">their part of the meta crisis and then</text><text start="339.419" dur="5.961">assume that everyone understands</text><text start="341.22" dur="6.9">everything it has to be assembled in a</text><text start="345.38" dur="4.72">an individual mind and then hopefully</text><text start="348.12" dur="4.68">you&apos;ll grow the number of those minds</text><text start="350.1" dur="4.86">but first of all it&apos;s it&apos;s complex and</text><text start="352.8" dur="3.239">second of all we&apos;re being bombarded by</text><text start="354.96" dur="3.72">the</text><text start="356.039" dur="5.16">Facebook and and other things competing</text><text start="358.68" dur="5.18">for things that are not relevant to our</text><text start="361.199" dur="5.521">future that are not giving us a full</text><text start="363.86" dur="5.08">healthy experience both</text><text start="366.72" dur="4.199">calorically and mentally and and</text><text start="368.94" dur="4.5">otherwise it&apos;s actually something that</text><text start="370.919" dur="4.081">you said about the uh must be processed</text><text start="373.44" dur="2.819">in a single human mind it&apos;s important I</text><text start="375.0" dur="3.66">want to come back to but just to make</text><text start="376.259" dur="4.16">sense of The Detour and why I was</text><text start="378.66" dur="4.92">mentioning the thing about</text><text start="380.419" dur="4.961">in food and online relationships and all</text><text start="383.58" dur="3.839">those areas there&apos;s like a hypernormal</text><text start="385.38" dur="3.78">stimuli that is separated from the rest</text><text start="387.419" dur="3.9">of what made it evolutionarily relevant</text><text start="389.16" dur="3.24">is</text><text start="391.319" dur="2.761">um and that&apos;s kind of the one</text><text start="392.4" dur="3.06">marshmallow reward circuit rather than</text><text start="394.08" dur="4.32">the two marshmallow reward circuit that</text><text start="395.46" dur="5.22">involves some self-application for some</text><text start="398.4" dur="3.78">kind of um delayed and healthier</text><text start="400.68" dur="3.299">gratification</text><text start="402.18" dur="4.56">is</text><text start="403.979" dur="4.081">uh that obviously is also the case with</text><text start="406.74" dur="3.06">the kind of</text><text start="408.06" dur="3.12">reward circuits associated with sense</text><text start="409.8" dur="3.179">making and understanding the one</text><text start="411.18" dur="3.78">marshmallow reward circuits are to get</text><text start="412.979" dur="3.72">certainty very quickly without the work</text><text start="414.96" dur="4.019">of actually trying to study and</text><text start="416.699" dur="6.72">understand the situation and just so</text><text start="418.979" dur="7.141">that certainty is a one marshmallow</text><text start="423.419" dur="4.62">that makes sense so I know what in group</text><text start="426.12" dur="4.919">I&apos;m a part of because we&apos;re all outraged</text><text start="428.039" dur="4.681">at the at the terrible trumpers or the</text><text start="431.039" dur="3.181">dumb lib tards or whatever it is on the</text><text start="432.72" dur="2.64">other side I know what in group I&apos;m a</text><text start="434.22" dur="2.699">part of and I feel safe because there&apos;s</text><text start="435.36" dur="3.24">lots of us and we&apos;re really certain and</text><text start="436.919" dur="5.22">we&apos;re really sanctimonious</text><text start="438.6" dur="7.98">and um and I get that feeling of like</text><text start="442.139" dur="6.421">there&apos;s a false sense of identity and</text><text start="446.58" dur="4.26">esteem and kind of the Maslow&apos;s need</text><text start="448.56" dur="4.139">sense which is sanctimony right I get to</text><text start="450.84" dur="4.199">feel esteem because I feel so obviously</text><text start="452.699" dur="5.641">smarter than the dumb ones</text><text start="455.039" dur="5.821">um who think the other wrong thing and</text><text start="458.34" dur="4.919">um I also get to feel the security that</text><text start="460.86" dur="4.92">is associated with feeling certain even</text><text start="463.259" dur="5.101">though it&apos;s a false certainty and so I</text><text start="465.78" dur="5.039">would say those are those are the need</text><text start="468.36" dur="4.32">for belonging and the need for security</text><text start="470.819" dur="3.181">and the need for esteem are all getting</text><text start="472.68" dur="4.2">hijacked</text><text start="474.0" dur="4.74">getting turned into Political Warfare</text><text start="476.88" dur="3.48">in a way that is useful for political</text><text start="478.74" dur="4.38">parties and people who want to sell</text><text start="480.36" dur="4.8">their Wares and whatever else it is</text><text start="483.12" dur="4.38">um but those are all the One marshmallow</text><text start="485.16" dur="4.2">award circuits of like wait did I</text><text start="487.5" dur="3.72">actually read all of the literature on</text><text start="489.36" dur="4.14">climate change in depth or on vaccines</text><text start="491.22" dur="4.74">or on whatever it is and really come to</text><text start="493.5" dur="4.44">sense make this on my own or did I get a</text><text start="495.96" dur="5.4">sense of certainty really prematurely</text><text start="497.94" dur="5.4">and really kind of hand it to me</text><text start="501.36" dur="3.6">um so similarly when you&apos;re saying like</text><text start="503.34" dur="4.44">what are the skills underneath it I</text><text start="504.96" dur="4.62">think the skill of like the quality of</text><text start="507.78" dur="4.08">earnestness in our desire to understand</text><text start="509.58" dur="3.839">the reality we live in</text><text start="511.86" dur="3.96">and</text><text start="513.419" dur="4.201">the earnestness associated with just a</text><text start="515.82" dur="3.719">pure
