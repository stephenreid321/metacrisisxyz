hope</text><text start="356.22" dur="5.72">that sounds good to all of you</text><text start="358.86" dur="3.08">so let's begin</text><text start="364.979" dur="4.5">it's hard to know where the beginning is</text><text start="367.68" dur="3.859">this sort of thing</text><text start="369.479" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="374.52" dur="4.8">I think one thing that I would like to</text><text start="376.38" dur="5.879">start with is</text><text start="379.32" dur="6.659">the recognition that</text><text start="382.259" dur="7.801">our institutions and the structures</text><text start="385.979" dur="5.701">that our societies are held Within</text><text start="390.06" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="391.68" dur="4.139">are not prepared and are not prepared to</text><text start="394.56" dur="3.5">be prepared</text><text start="395.819" dur="5.701">to respond</text><text start="398.06" dur="5.74">to the needs of the people</text><text start="401.52" dur="3.959">in the way that</text><text start="403.8" dur="3.959">is needed</text><text start="405.479" dur="4.801">this is true not only with health</text><text start="407.759" dur="6.241">services or with defense services or</text><text start="410.28" dur="4.74">with food services or with</text><text start="414.0" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="415.02" dur="5.04">Mental Health Services</text><text start="417.78" dur="4.859">economic</text><text start="420.06" dur="5.16">Services Etc</text><text start="422.639" dur="4.62">we've seen several events just in the</text><text start="425.22" dur="3.599">few last few months</text><text start="427.259" dur="5.761">where</text><text start="428.819" dur="8.701">uh fires in Maui or floods in Libya or</text><text start="433.02" dur="5.58">earthquakes in Morocco or run away</text><text start="437.52" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="438.6" dur="4.319">disinformation</text><text start="441.0" dur="4.08">algorithms</text><text start="442.919" dur="5.4">uh</text><text start="445.08" dur="5.7">the opioid crisis Etc where there wasn't</text><text start="448.319" dur="5.541">the capability of the existing systems</text><text start="450.78" dur="3.08">to actually respond</text><text start="456.06" dur="4.38">in the work that I've been doing with</text><text start="458.639" dur="3.78">warm data</text><text start="460.44" dur="3.78">one of the things that I've been most</text><text start="462.419" dur="8.12">concerned with</text><text start="464.22" dur="6.319">is how to make it possible</text><text start="471.06" dur="7.32">for people to be there for each other</text><text start="475.46" dur="5.26">and what does that mean</text><text start="478.38" dur="4.74">what would that take because you can't</text><text start="480.72" dur="4.379">tell people to be respectful of each</text><text start="483.12" dur="6.54">other you can't tell people they have to</text><text start="485.099" dur="7.141">help each other you can't mandate that</text><text start="489.66" dur="5.759">you can't send them to a class for this</text><text start="492.24" dur="4.739">is how you do this</text><text start="495.419" dur="2.881">because they don't know what they're</text><text start="496.979" dur="3.0">going to be facing</text><text start="498.3" dur="3.179">the main thing is can they learn</text><text start="499.979" dur="7.021">together</text><text start="501.479" dur="7.62">can they can they meet chaos together</text><text start="507.0" dur="4.02">how do we meet chaos</text><text start="509.099" dur="5.82">together</text><text start="511.02" dur="8.54">with as much love and care and Grace</text><text start="514.919" dur="4.641">and creativity improvisation as possible</text><text start="519.839" dur="4.861">so that's where I thought we would start</text><text start="522.36" dur="6.0">and you sent me this great message from</text><text start="524.7" dur="7.28">the car so I'm really looking forward to</text><text start="528.36" dur="3.62">hearing what you're going to say</text><text start="532.08" dur="4.62">I just sent the message that she's going</text><text start="534.3" dur="5.34">to get to meet a very fevered version of</text><text start="536.7" dur="4.86">my brain uh tonight because I</text><text start="539.64" dur="4.44">can you guys hear me with this</text><text start="541.56" dur="4.92">I am</text><text start="544.08" dur="3.78">I'm actually quite ill but the Tylenol</text><text start="546.48" dur="3.539">is hiding it</text><text start="547.86" dur="4.32">I canceled everything yesterday and</text><text start="550.019" dur="5.341">today with the exception of this but I</text><text start="552.18" dur="4.5">didn't want to cancel this because</text><text start="555.36" dur="3.56">um</text><text start="556.68" dur="4.76">last time I was here</text><text start="558.92" dur="5.2">this was the</text><text start="561.44" dur="6.16">community that I felt most connected to</text><text start="564.12" dur="5.76">in Sweden it felt like there were a lot</text><text start="567.6" dur="4.56">of people here really earnestly trying</text><text start="569.88" dur="5.399">to do the most important work they could</text><text start="572.16" dur="6.78">Pella I met last time is working on</text><text start="575.279" dur="6.24">making Eco side an actual crime against</text><text start="578.94" dur="4.14">humanity at the ICC it's like an</text><text start="581.519" dur="3.901">incredible project there are people here</text><text start="583.08" dur="4.259">working at on planetary boundaries and</text><text start="585.42" dur="4.26">uh</text><text start="587.339" dur="3.841">and so I really wanted to be with</text><text start="589.68" dur="3.599">everybody and I just want to apologize</text><text start="591.18" dur="4.92">for not being all that coherent tonight</text><text start="593.279" dur="4.441">and for not being here early to get to</text><text start="596.1" dur="3.6">greet and talk with everybody and I</text><text start="597.72" dur="4.619">probably won't be able to stay late but</text><text start="599.7" dur="4.62">I I wanted to show up</text><text start="602.339" dur="5.541">I would also say take everything I say</text><text start="604.32" dur="3.56">with extra grains of salt tonight</text><text start="608.519" dur="5.76">you were saying how do we be with chaos</text><text start="611.339" dur="5.661">together and we're gonna get a chance to</text><text start="614.279" dur="2.721">find out soon</text><text start="617.16" dur="3.119">and you were saying that the</text><text start="618.3" dur="4.26">institutions aren't prepared to handle</text><text start="620.279" dur="4.861">it and I would say the</text><text start="622.56" dur="6.0">the most powerful institutions that run</text><text start="625.14" dur="5.28">the world are criminally insane</text><text start="628.56" dur="3.36">it's not just that they're not prepared</text><text start="630.42" dur="6.539">to handle it or they're slightly</text><text start="631.92" dur="7.32">Antiquated I don't think we've had a war</text><text start="636.959" dur="5.701">in a long time</text><text start="639.24" dur="5.58">at least since World War II that the U.S</text><text start="642.66" dur="3.9">has been involved in that wasn't a false</text><text start="644.82" dur="4.019">flag War</text><text start="646.56" dur="3.959">we know that there were no weapons of</text><text start="648.839" dur="3.961">mass destruction in Iraq but we actually</text><text start="650.519" dur="3.721">know that Cheney and Rumsfeld knew there</text><text start="652.8" dur="3.779">were no weapons of mass destruction in</text><text start="654.24" dur="4.68">Iraq and four and a half million people</text><text start="656.579" dur="4.861">were murdered as a result of the</text><text start="658.92" dur="5.94">activities that started</text><text start="661.44" dur="5.82">and the banks and financial services</text><text start="664.86" dur="4.74">groups that require exponentiation of</text><text start="667.26" dur="3.24">the monetary Supply venusifying the</text><text start="669.6" dur="4.5">planet</text><text start="670.5" dur="6.2">and uh driving biodiversity loss and all</text><text start="674.1" dur="4.859">those things like this is not just</text><text start="676.7" dur="3.3">unprepared to deal with the moment this</text><text start="678.959" dur="5.161">is</text><text start="680.0" dur="7.019">suicidal omnicidal criminally insane</text><text start="684.12" dur="2.899">and</text><text start="688.5" dur="8.04">yeah that's it so what was on my mind is</text><text start="692.519" dur="5.641">that there's a cognitive dissonance</text><text start="696.54" dur="3.6">because when</text><text start="698.16" dur="4.02">the things that are threatening Global</text><text start="700.14" dur="4.319">catastrophic risks are mostly invisible</text><text start="702.18" dur="4.56">you can't see them they're hyper objects</text><text start="704.459" dur="4.261">you can't see climate change you can see</text><text start="706.74" dur="4.08">weather but there was always weather</text><text start="708.72" dur="3.84">but to know that the extreme weather is</text><text start="710.82" dur="3.72">statistically worse and worsening you</text><text start="712.56" dur="3.24">have to do math and you can question the</text><text start="714.54" dur="2.4">math if you don't know how to do the</text><text start="715.8" dur="3.599">math properly</text><text start="716.94" dur="5.339">and you can't see species Extinction and</text><text start="719.399" dur="5.781">you can't see the rate of AI growth and</text><text start="722.279" dur="5.461">you can't see synthetic bios total</text><text start="725.18" dur="6.96">vulnerability landscape all of these are</text><text start="727.74" dur="4.4">radical abstractions of complexities</text><text start="732.779" dur="3.8">and what you see looks pretty fine</text><text start="736.8" dur="4.5">in fact it looks more convenient than</text><text start="739.44" dur="3.0">ever Amazon just delivers stuff to your</text><text start="741.3" dur="3.96">door</text><text start="742.44" dur="6.12">and</text><text start="745.26" dur="5.46">so in the past when a civilization would</text><text start="748.56" dur="4.2">face a catastrophic risk it was either</text><text start="750.72" dur="4.2">because there was a eminent natural</text><text start="752.76" dur="4.019">disaster coming that everybody saw or</text><text start="754.92" dur="4.2">there was war coming that everybody saw</text><text start="756.779" dur="4.5">and in that place people were ready to</text><text start="759.12" dur="4.8">mobilize in the presence of</text><text start="761.279" dur="5.041">an attacking Army you stopped focusing</text><text start="763.92" dur="4.32">on quality of life and competing with</text><text start="766.32" dur="4.16">the neighbors and started focusing on</text><text start="768.24" dur="5.279">survival</text><text start="770.48" dur="5.26">right now what is at risk is radically</text><text start="773.519" dur="6.921">more than all previous catastrophic</text><text start="775.74" dur="4.7">events combined and it's invisible</text><text start="780.48" dur="3.599">and so there's this cognitive dissonance</text><text start="782.459" dur="5.601">if we actually need to be in something</text><text start="784.079" dur="3.981">much more like wartime mentality</text><text start="788.76" dur="4.44">but everything looks fine and then</text><text start="790.98" dur="5.46">people will say you know don't you need</text><text start="793.2" dur="5.639">work-life balance and like that</text><text start="796.44" dur="5.36">that is totally not cognizant of the</text><text start="798.839" dur="2.961">actual World we're in</text><text start="810.779" dur="5.821">and there are a lot of I think people</text><text start="813.66" dur="6.54">who are not necessarily</text><text start="816.6" dur="5.46">uh criminally evil working inside these</text><text start="820.2" dur="4.199">institutions at the bottom teachers</text><text start="822.06" dur="5.76">doctors</text><text start="824.399" dur="5.821">um people working in various parts of</text><text start="827.82" dur="4.079">the you know the system that are trying</text><text start="830.22" dur="4.44">believing they're trying to help people</text><text start="831.899" dur="6.661">in some way and are earnestly</text><text start="834.66" dur="7.38">doing their best and they can't</text><text start="838.56" dur="5.16">so this is something that I see all the</text><text start="842.04" dur="4.919">time is that if</text><text start="843.72" dur="5.299">if you're talking about</text><text start="846.959" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="849.72" dur="6.54">well you can start anywhere</text><text start="851.639" dur="7.981">and the issue is never just one thing</text><text start="856.26" dur="7.019">so you end up with somebody who is</text><text start="859.62" dur="5.459">suffering from a diagnosis of some</text><text start="863.279" dur="4.86">mental health thing and you figure out</text><text start="865.079" dur="5.641">that well there's also there's also a</text><text start="868.139" dur="5.581">lack of food and there's also a lack of</text><text start="870.72" dur="5.52">family and there's also all sorts of</text><text start="873.72" dur="5.9">other things that are happening in in</text><text start="876.24" dur="7.14">that that are producing these</text><text start="879.62" dur="5.68">symptoms that are consequences of many</text><text start="883.38" dur="3.6">complex systems coming together and I</text><text start="885.3" dur="3.3">would suggest that probably in this room</text><text start="886.98" dur="5.099">there's not very many people who don't</text><text start="888.6" dur="8.239">have some kind of crisis in their life</text><text start="892.079" dur="4.76">um and and how do we actually</text><text start="898.199" dur="5.401">get through the day together</text><text start="900.72" dur="6.96">continuing

acknowledges the real</text><text start="1232.58" dur="5.459">complexity of things which means that</text><text start="1235.4" dur="4.56">you have to look at for whatever problem</text><text

that's what we called this talk</text><text start="3392.579" dur="6.141">what is important</text><text start="3395.4" dur="3.32">what is important</text><text start="3402.839" dur="4.26">um</text><text start="3403.38" dur="7.38">sometimes I do an exercise</text><text start="3407.099" dur="8.281">with my classes</text><text start="3410.76" dur="7.079">where I ask people to do to describe a</text><text start="3415.38" dur="4.199">system any system</text><text start="3417.839" dur="4.141">any system</text><text start="3419.579" dur="3.661">your body your relationship to

start="3429.059" dur="6.481">and to illustrate it okay now most of</text><text start="3432.48" dur="7.859">the time when we illustrate a system</text><text start="3435.54" dur="6.72">you start by having nodes okay so</text><text start="3440.339" dur="4.201">there's an economy node or there's a</text><text start="3442.26" dur="4.559">family node or there's a you know here's</text><text start="3444.54" dur="4.2">me and there's my husband and here's my</text><text start="3446.819" dur="4.861">kids and here's you have these nodes and</text><text start="3448.74" dur="5.42">then we connect them with lines</text><text start="3451.68" dur="2.48">right</text><text start="3454.319" dur="3.121">um</text><text start="3455.04" dur="4.92">or you know you could do another one you</text><text start="3457.44" dur="6.26">could do one on nav right let's let's</text><text start="3459.96" dur="3.74">draw the system that is nav</text><text start="3465.599" dur="6.661">but don't use any lines</text><text start="3469.04" dur="4.48">see if you can call</text><text start="3472.26" dur="5.24">up</text><text start="3473.52" dur="3.98">another form of description</text><text start="3478.319" dur="5.461">because you don't have any relationships</text><text start="3480.48" dur="6.3">in your life that look like lines</text><text start="3483.78" dur="5.76">or feel like lines so this is really</text><text start="3486.78" dur="6.36">important because actually</text><text start="3489.54" dur="6.24">if you think that you are responding</text><text start="3493.14" dur="5.34">to or studying A system that is</text><text start="3495.78" dur="6.5">connected by nodes and lines you're</text><text start="3498.48" dur="3.8">missing a lot of information</text><text start="3502.44" dur="5.399">a lot of very important information</text><text start="3504.859" dur="5.861">what's in those relationships how do</text><text start="3507.839" dur="7.381">they what texture are they what color</text><text start="3510.72" dur="6.48">are they what Rhythm are they in</text><text start="3515.22" dur="4.379">how do the relationships relate to the</text><text start="3517.2" dur="5.399">other relationships so that you don't</text><text start="3519.599" dur="6.061">end up with some kind of idea that you</text><text start="3522.599" dur="4.861">can just swish in more and more and more</text><text start="3525.66" dur="3.6">data</text><text start="3527.46" dur="3.72">to get an understanding of the system</text><text start="3529.26" dur="3.72">you have to actually understand what's</text><text start="3531.18" dur="4.32">in the relationship between the</text><text start="3532.98" dur="5.04">different aspects of it and what's the</text><text start="3535.5" dur="6.359">feeling of those relationships</text><text start="3538.02" dur="6.779">right you could describe a family</text><text start="3541.859" dur="4.861">and you could have you know parents kids</text><text start="3544.799" dur="4.201">grandparents and just draw some lines</text><text start="3546.72" dur="4.8">but as you know</text><text start="3549.0" dur="5.52">every family has a completely different</text><text start="3551.52" dur="6.539">logic and feel and communication that's</text><text start="3554.52" dur="5.7">possible in that family</text><text start="3558.059" dur="5.28">so</text><text start="3560.22" dur="6.48">that exercise for me gets at what you're</text><text start="3563.339" dur="6.421">talking about that that it's</text><text start="3566.7" dur="5.46">there's a there's a whole Realm</text><text start="3569.76" dur="5.099">of information that's there that you</text><text start="3572.16" dur="4.139">know you're in it you just haven't been</text><text start="3574.859" dur="3.901">asked</text><text start="3576.299" dur="5.101">to express it it's not the normal way we</text><text start="3578.76" dur="4.799">express it and if you just look at</text><text start="3581.4" dur="4.439">systemic process as nodes that are</text><text start="3583.559" dur="4.5">connected by lines you have a different</text><text start="3585.839" dur="5.28">agency altogether</text><text start="3588.059" dur="5.881">than if you start to actually illustrate</text><text start="3591.119" dur="4.74">those relational processes your sense of</text><text start="3593.94" dur="4.619">agency</text><text start="3595.859" dur="3.96">is vastly changed</text><text start="3598.559" dur="3.3">by that</text><text start="3599.819" dur="5.28">what do you how do you how do you come</text><text start="3601.859" dur="5.341">into that right if you have nodes and</text><text start="3605.099" dur="4.5">sticks you can move this and remove that</text><text start="3607.2" dur="5.24">and you have this first order agency is</text><text start="3609.599" dur="2.841">easy to come by</text><text start="3614.099" dur="4.561">foreign</text><text

dur="5.22">um</text><text start="4642.56" dur="6.36">so in her uh typical Nora way I said how</text><text start="4646.82" dur="5.399">long would you like me to speak and she</text><text start="4648.92" dur="5.64">says between 1 and 20 minutes</text><text start="4652.219" dur="5.641">uh it'll be closer to one and then we</text><text start="4654.56" dur="5.88">can take a break and uh and reconvene</text><text start="4657.86" dur="4.02">and do some questions Daniel don't take</text><text start="4660.44" dur="3.06">this the wrong way but you should get</text><text start="4661.88"

Daniel has recently recommended</text><text start="4671.6" dur="4.74">some multivitamins to me and there's a</text><text start="4674.12" dur="4.68">daytime one and a nighttime one and this</text><text

a little sleepy</text><text start="4684.92" dur="5.34">um</text><text start="4686.9" dur="4.68">so uh I took a few notes</text><text start="4690.26" dur="3.419">um</text><text start="4691.58" dur="5.82">I think that</text><text start="4693.679" dur="5.52">we do know the future in some ways we</text><text start="4697.4" dur="3.6">don't know what it's going to look like</text><text start="4699.199" dur="3.441">but there are some biophysical</text><text start="4701.0" dur="6.42">constraints</text><text start="4702.64" dur="7.78">recently in my work I talk about the The</text><text start="4707.42" dur="5.94">Four Horsemen of the 2020s which are</text><text start="4710.42" dur="5.64">number one are our Financial claims</text><text start="4713.36"

doubling down</text><text start="4721.699" dur="6.261">and creating debt at a very fast uh rate</text><text start="4726.159" dur="5.861">and that</text><text start="4727.96" dur="6.34">inevitably has to reconnect with the</text><text start="4732.02" dur="5.219">biophysical underpinnings of our our</text><text start="4734.3" dur="4.14">situation which are energy materials uh</text><text start="4737.239" dur="4.261">and ecology</text><text start="4738.44" dur="3.9">the second category is</text><text start="4741.5" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="4742.34" dur="5.58">we are rapidly changing our relationship</text><text start="4746.0" dur="3.96">with what is</text><text start="4747.92" dur="4.62">the wealth and productivity that has got</text><text start="4749.96" dur="4.199">us to this point and the historical</text><text start="4752.54" dur="3.96">story has been about money and</text><text start="4754.159" dur="4.801">technology and the reality is energy</text><text start="4756.5" dur="4.199">materials and ecology and with the</text><text start="4758.96" dur="4.68">Russia Ukraine situation our</text><text start="4760.699" dur="5.281">geopolitical Arrangement and Daniel</text><text start="4763.64" dur="4.68">talked about all the wars in the past</text><text start="4765.98" dur="5.64">being started by false flags and the</text><text start="4768.32" dur="6.3">Very sociopathic powerful people</text><text start="4771.62" dur="5.66">um so there is a phase shift from a</text><text start="4774.62" dur="5.64">unipolar to a multi-polar world</text><text start="4777.28" dur="5.8">the third risk is the six continent</text><text start="4780.26" dur="5.16">supply chain and the complexity of our</text><text start="4783.08" dur="5.22">grocery stores and our systems and our</text><text start="4785.42" dur="5.819">medical supplies because it's been based</text><text start="4788.3" dur="5.04">on this part of the carbon pulse where</text><text start="4791.239" dur="5.161">we've outsourced everything into this</text><text start="4793.34" dur="5.94">really complex situation and then the</text><text start="4796.4" dur="6.6">last piece is the social contract how we</text><text start="4799.28" dur="8.1">get along with our our fellow citizens</text><text start="4803.0" dur="5.88">within and between countries and so we</text><text start="4807.38" dur="4.38">don't know what's going to happen</text><text start="4808.88" dur="6.06">specifically but I think now there are</text><text start="4811.76" dur="5.16">no longer any non-radical paths ahead of</text><text start="4814.94" dur="5.04">us in the next decade</text><text start="4816.92" dur="4.68">and so we might not know what's going to</text><text start="4819.98" dur="4.62">happen in the scale of what's going to</text><text start="4821.6" dur="6.96">happen but I think getting to Nora's</text><text start="4824.6" dur="6.42">point about nth order agency there are</text><text start="4828.56" dur="4.679">some no regret strategies</text><text start="4831.02" dur="5.34">um that exist and</text><text start="4833.239" dur="6.48">the one staring Us in the face is what's</text><text start="4836.36" dur="5.94">here this evening is we have to start</text><text start="4839.719" dur="5.101">building social capital and social</text><text start="4842.3" dur="5.04">relationships even if we're not solving</text><text start="4844.82" dur="5.58">problems even if we're not doing things</text><text start="4847.34" dur="5.399">directly to prepare because we can't</text><text start="4850.4" dur="4.44">really prepare other than to maybe</text><text start="4852.739" dur="4.201">imagine what life would be like with 30</text><text start="4854.84" dur="5.64">percent less income or 30 percent less</text><text start="4856.94" dur="5.299">energy and then act accordingly but what</text><text start="4860.48" dur="4.259">we can do is

stuckness</text><text start="6267.06" dur="5.639">um it's not a good question</text><text start="6269.6" dur="5.98">because it depends on where you draw the</text><text start="6272.699" dur="4.801">edge of the stuckness right where if you</text><text start="6275.58" dur="3.78">if you're not careful and you say the</text><text start="6277.5" dur="5.119">system is stuck what you're not

and we went to this clinic and</text><text start="6299.42" dur="7.66">what I saw there was without question</text><text start="6303.86" dur="5.859">the most beautiful systemic work I've</text><text start="6307.08" dur="6.18">ever seen to this day</text><text start="6309.719" dur="6.361">and what they did required no beeping</text><text start="6313.26" dur="3.5">things it required</text><text start="6316.08" dur="3.079">um</text><text start="6316.76" dur="5.5">no injections</text><text start="6319.159" dur="8.02">it required</text><text start="6322.26" dur="7.62">a a fascinating process in which for</text><text start="6327.179" dur="6.661">example the practitioner would would</text><text start="6329.88" dur="6.72">offer a small wooden block with a spiral</text><text start="6333.84" dur="6.0">in it and ask the patient</text><text start="6336.6" dur="5.16">to describe what it would feel like to</text><text start="6339.84" dur="3.06">run their finger around that spiral not</text><text start="6341.76" dur="3.66">to do it</text><text start="6342.9" dur="4.5">but to describe it verbally okay so I'm</text><text start="6345.42" dur="3.9">inviting you into this because I want</text><text start="6347.4" dur="4.14">you to notice</text><text start="6349.32" dur="5.1">all the cognitive processes that are</text><text start="6351.54" dur="5.4">necessary to do just that</text><text start="6354.42" dur="5.279">okay that's visual that's memory that's</text><text start="6356.94" dur="5.759">verbal that's tactile that's relational</text><text start="6359.699" dur="4.261">that's cultural there's a whole lot just</text><text start="6362.699" dur="4.741">right there</text><text start="6363.96" dur="4.98">what they didn't do was go up to that</text><text start="6367.44" dur="4.38">Frozen</text><text start="6368.94" dur="5.58">arm of the person in paralysis and try</text><text start="6371.82" dur="4.859">to open it massage it acupuncture it</text><text start="6374.52" dur="3.599">treat it stretch it open it they didn't</text><text start="6376.679" dur="5.161">do that</text><text start="6378.119" dur="7.08">then they would give the the block again</text><text start="6381.84" dur="4.92">and this time run the the finger of the</text><text start="6385.199" dur="3.901">the good hand if there was one around</text><text start="6386.76" dur="4.439">very slowly and at the end of that</text><text start="6389.1" dur="5.22">movement around the spiral ask the</text><text start="6391.199" dur="5.04">question not what did you feel</text><text start="6394.32" dur="5.339">but what's the difference</text><text start="6396.239" dur="8.4">okay and in that question</text><text start="6399.659" dur="6.781">what is being required for a response is</text><text start="6404.639" dur="4.261">actually three versions</text><text start="6406.44" dur="3.9">okay it's it's what they felt the first</text><text start="6408.9" dur="3.06">time what they felt the second time and</text><text start="6410.34" dur="4.56">what the difference was so that's</text><text start="6411.96" dur="5.279">complicated and then it's also visual</text><text start="6414.9" dur="3.54">tactile temperature comes in with this</text><text start="6417.239" dur="3.541">one</text><text start="6418.44" dur="4.14">um measurement movement of arm and like</text><text start="6420.78" dur="3.24">you know when you move your finger</text><text start="6422.58" dur="3.659">around a spiral there's measurement</text><text start="6424.02" dur="3.38">happening how far is it around</text><text start="6426.239" dur="2.821">speed</text><text start="6427.4" dur="4.06">ballots</text><text start="6429.06" dur="3.599">again speech</text><text start="6431.46" dur="5.34">Etc</text><text start="6432.659" dur="6.301">so what's happening in this process</text><text start="6436.8" dur="4.319">and this is where the inspiration for</text><text start="6438.96" dur="5.52">the warm data lab came from</text><text start="6441.119" dur="5.1">is that these different aspects of</text><text start="6444.48" dur="2.82">cognitive</text><text start="6446.219" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="6447.3" dur="4.859">learning are actually informing each</text><text start="6450.239" dur="4.201">other</text><text start="6452.159" dur="4.861">and they're doing so inside the</text><text start="6454.44" dur="5.64">individual in a way that is absolutely</text><text start="6457.02" dur="6.92">free to move in the way that it moves</text><text start="6460.08" dur="3.86">according to that person</text><text start="6464.639" dur="5.221">that's cool</text><text start="6467.219" dur="4.201">so and and I would you know obviously I</text><text start="6469.86" dur="4.5">wouldn't be that impressed with it if I</text><text start="6471.42" dur="5.54">didn't see that it was also working</text><text start="6474.36" dur="2.6">um so</text><text start="6477.119" dur="6.661">what I am leery of</text><text start="6480.119" dur="5.641">is this idea that it's ever</text><text start="6483.78" dur="4.379">remotely</text><text start="6485.76" dur="3.78">beneficial to tell people what they</text><text start="6488.159" dur="3.54">should think what they should do or how</text><text start="6489.54" dur="5.04">they should feel</text><text start="6491.699" dur="4.681">and what I love about that process</text><text start="6494.58" dur="3.48">is the way in which there is a</text><text start="6496.38" dur="4.14">wilderness</text><text start="6498.06" dur="5.159">of connective processes that are shaping</text><text start="6500.52" dur="5.52">and informing each other</text><text start="6503.219" dur="5.161">right so I asked them because I noticed</text><text start="6506.04" dur="4.619">they weren't going for the what I would</text><text start="6508.38" dur="4.5">call the pathology the paralysis they</text><text start="6510.659" dur="5.941">didn't go for the thing it wasn't a</text><text start="6512.88" dur="5.04">first order corrective this is an</text><text start="6516.6" dur="4.44">example</text><text start="6517.92" dur="4.38">of an of an nth order response I want</text><text start="6521.04" dur="3.24">you to be we've been talking about</text><text start="6522.3" dur="3.6">nthort or agency tonight and how it</text><text start="6524.28" dur="5.28">doesn't look like what you think it's</text><text start="6525.9" dur="6.239">going to look like this is an example</text><text start="6529.56" dur="5.639">so of course what happens is that not</text><text start="6532.139" dur="5.341">not only do these people change in terms</text><text start="6535.199" dur="4.621">of their possibility of how their body</text><text start="6537.48" dur="5.04">moves and understands their world but</text><text start="6539.82" dur="5.7">their whole personality opens into new</text><text start="6542.52" dur="4.44">curiosity new artistic creation not all</text><text start="6545.52" dur="4.56">sorts of things happen</text><text start="6546.96" dur="4.679">capacities for emotion capacities for</text><text start="6550.08" dur="3.36">all sorts of things that maybe they</text><text start="6551.639" dur="3.921">didn't have before they were paralyzed</text><text start="6553.44" dur="2.12">actually</text><text start="6556.44" dur="5.58">so what's pathology</text><text start="6559.44" dur="5.219">what's pathology</text><text start="6562.02" dur="4.56">and when I asked them this I asked it</text><text start="6564.659" dur="4.201">because I realized that the thing I saw</text><text start="6566.58" dur="5.639">wasn't what they were seeing</text><text start="6568.86" dur="7.44">and what their response was was that</text><text start="6572.219" dur="7.161">pathology is the organisms inability to</text><text start="6576.3" dur="3.08">make sense of its world</text><text start="6580.56" dur="4.8">that's a really interesting definition</text><text start="6582.54" dur="5.88">of pathology</text><text start="6585.36" dur="6.2">so what is happening in that exercise is</text><text start="6588.42" dur="5.759">that there is a multi</text><text start="6591.56" dur="4.96">multi-sensorial multi-cognitive process</text><text start="6594.179" dur="3.321">that is given an opportunity to</text><text start="6596.52" dur="5.28">reconnect</text><text start="6597.5" dur="7.0">re to to make new formations</text><text start="6601.8" dur="4.319">of sense making of how what it is to be</text><text start="6604.5" dur="3.06">in the world they're not healing them</text><text start="6606.119" dur="3.181">they're not putting them back how they</text><text start="6607.56" dur="3.54">were they're not reconstituted that</text><text start="6609.3" dur="4.14">they're not at all</text><text start="6611.1" dur="4.86">so we changed our question to how do</text><text start="6613.44" dur="6.02">systems learn</text><text start="6615.96" dur="3.5">not how do they get unstuck</text><text start="6619.679" dur="4.44">um and there's a whole lot of work on</text><text start="6621.42" dur="5.299">that but you asked what for me was the</text><text start="6624.119" dur="6.721">most hopeful and it was that because of</text><text start="6626.719" dur="8.621">this incredible insight there</text><text start="6630.84" dur="6.839">for the potential for things to make</text><text start="6635.34" dur="4.5">connection that are not necessarily</text><text start="6637.679" dur="5.161">doing it explicitly all right we talked</text><text start="6639.84" dur="5.16">about implicit change and when is it</text><text start="6642.84" dur="5.54">and it it's a win it's an interesting</text><text start="6645.0" dur="3.38">question because when is it</text><text start="6648.48" dur="4.56">and suddenly it happens</text><text start="6650.34" dur="5.16">and you don't know how far you are on</text><text start="6653.04" dur="4.32">the X line before you have one more</text><text start="6655.5" dur="4.26">minute and suddenly there's a shift</text><text start="6657.36" dur="3.42">there's a learning</text><text start="6659.76" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="6660.78" dur="6.12">and for me this also ties into the</text><text start="6663.48" dur="5.1">question around Orcs And how can</text><text start="6666.9" dur="4.319">organizations</text><text start="6668.58" dur="4.44">do better which is I'm just paraphrasing</text><text start="6671.219" dur="4.761">what you said</text><text start="6673.02" dur="2.96">um which</text><text start="6677.34" dur="3.299">for us for what I'm interested in with</text><text start="6679.86" dur="3.0">that</text><text start="6680.639" dur="4.381">is working with organizations and when</text><text start="6682.86" dur="6.48">we do warm data work with

problem</text><text start="6698.88" dur="4.68">so when we do warm data Labs with</text><text start="6701.159" dur="4.56">organizations we ask them to be sure</text><text start="6703.56" dur="3.659">that everyone who comes invites people</text><text start="6705.719" dur="3.541">from their life</text><text start="6707.219" dur="4.621">their family their friends people from</text><text start="6709.26" dur="3.78">the community so that the membrane is</text><text start="6711.84" dur="3.899">moved</text><text start="6713.04" dur="5.22">so that there is a different kind of</text><text start="6715.739" dur="4.861">accountability in the room</text><text start="6718.26" dur="5.959">so that people can actually be in</text><text start="6720.6" dur="6.96">another way besides just

development workshops with</text><text start="6731.76" dur="3.18">organizations is that they don't really</text><text start="6733.5" dur="4.199">want to develop past that point where</text><text start="6734.94" dur="4.5">they could lose their job</text><text start="6737.699" dur="6.98">it's a problem</text><text start="6739.44" dur="5.239">yeah okay so that that was just a few</text><text start="6744.78" dur="4.919">let me build on that and then Circle</text><text start="6747.119" dur="4.921">back to the question about hope</text><text start="6749.699" dur="4.621">so what I've learned from you among</text><text start="6752.04" dur="4.32">other things is you can't just look at</text><text start="6754.32" dur="5.819">the thing you have to look at the thing</text><text start="6756.36" dur="7.279">in the context of other things</text><text start="6760.139" dur="6.181">um and this has origins in biology</text><text start="6763.639" dur="5.261">multi-level selection it's not just that</text><text start="6766.32" dur="4.379">we're competitive creatures but we're</text><text start="6768.9" dur="4.5">also Cooperative creatures and those</text><text start="6770.699"

became friends and we</text><text start="6791.28" dur="4.5">started to interact our contexts and a</text><text start="6794.159" dur="4.381">couple things happened three things</text><text start="6795.78" dur="5.459">happened at least three things happened</text><text start="6798.54" dur="4.98">one is</text><text start="6801.239" dur="3.301">we actually constrained each other's</text><text start="6803.52" dur="2.94">stories</text><text start="6804.54" dur="3.42">because he didn't really know about my</text><text start="6806.46" dur="4.14">stuff and I didn't know about his stuff</text><text start="6807.96" dur="4.08">so we were both like oh man things are</text><text start="6810.6" dur="3.84">worse than we thought because I didn't</text><text start="6812.04" dur="4.199">know about your stuff</text><text start="6814.44" dur="3.6">um the second thing that happened is we</text><text start="6816.239" dur="3.601">became friends and we supported each</text><text start="6818.04" dur="3.9">other and then we introduced each other</text><text start="6819.84" dur="4.799">to other people and the network expanded</text><text start="6821.94" dur="4.739">and there was an emergence there and the</text><text start="6824.639" dur="4.08">third thing that happened is we're</text><text start="6826.679" dur="5.341">influencing a conversation and

dur="6.961">is the better side of humanity</text><text start="6911.76" dur="6.84">pontus you you said should we kill it we</text><text start="6915.6" dur="6.119">are at a unique time</text><text start="6918.6" dur="6.599">okay going back to your thing I'll add a</text><text start="6921.719" dur="5.701">a depressing fact but there's a reason</text><text start="6925.199" dur="3.901">10 000 years ago for every human that</text><text start="6927.42" dur="5.64">was on the planet there were fifteen</text><text start="6929.1" dur="7.5">thousand pounds of mammals wild mammals</text><text start="6933.06" dur="7.38">by the year 1800 for every human on the</text><text start="6936.6" dur="6.96">planet there were 200 pounds of mammals</text><text start="6940.44" dur="5.219">during that Ten Thousand Years</text><text start="6943.56" dur="3.96">it was largely that human population</text><text start="6945.659" dur="4.681">went up</text><text start="6947.52" dur="5.76">drip drove that but since 1800 we've</text><text start="6950.34" dur="7.2">gone from 200 pounds to five pounds of</text><text start="6953.28" dur="6.3">mammals per human alive and that is an</text><text start="6957.54" dur="4.139">increase in human population but it also</text><text start="6959.58" dur="5.94">is a decimation of nature</text><text start="6961.679" dur="6.181">so what we're doing this ecocidal</text><text start="6965.52" dur="4.679">tendency that we're having this has been</text><text start="6967.86" dur="5.06">in play for 10 000 years</text><text start="6970.199" dur="6.241">what's different now is the scale of it</text><text start="6972.92" dur="5.98">and this room full of people and others</text><text start="6976.44" dur="4.38">who are actually aware of it aware of</text><text start="6978.9" dur="4.259">where we came from how we got here what</text><text start="6980.82" dur="4.379">we're doing what we actually need and</text><text start="6983.159" dur="3.181">having these conversations</text><text start="6985.199" dur="4.681">so</text><text start="6986.34" dur="5.94">we are aware of it now is our awareness</text><text start="6989.88" dur="5.52">in a Heisenberg sort of observing</text><text start="6992.28" dur="5.58">science to change it in are we aware of</text><text start="6995.4" dur="5.279">the super organism and or Malik or</text><text start="6997.86" dur="5.819">whatever you say is that enough to</text><text start="7000.679" dur="6.181">change it in an emerging way to steer it</text><text start="7003.679" dur="6.381">to shrink it to transform it is a</text><text start="7006.86" dur="3.2">question I think about a lot</text><text start="7017.84" dur="2.839">but run away</text><text start="7020.96" dur="6.96">I mean there's a we there's a a runaway</text><text start="7024.92" dur="3.0">and</text><text start="7028.699" dur="4.681">I remember the first time I I went</text><text start="7031.88" dur="4.98">to a</text><text start="7033.38" dur="5.64">sort of a disclosure of an ipcc report</text><text start="7036.86" dur="4.259">and I looked at all the details and I</text><text start="7039.02" dur="3.78">said yeah but where what about the</text><text start="7041.119" dur="5.361">Runaway</text><text start="7042.8" dur="3.68">where's that part of this</text><text start="7047.719" dur="5.181">and they said oh no</text><text start="7049.94" dur="2.96">we don't do that</text><text start="7053.179" dur="4.141">wait a minute</text><text start="7054.38" dur="5.58">so we have all this bad news and you</text><text start="7057.32" dur="5.46">haven't done the Runaway</text><text start="7059.96" dur="6.179">this is really incredible</text><text start="7062.78" dur="6.72">because that's the part where</text><text start="7066.139" dur="5.701">the math goes</text><text start="7069.5" dur="5.58">into chaos math</text><text start="7071.84" dur="5.46">it's not even calculable at that point</text><text start="7075.08" dur="5.36">it's it's you do it for understanding</text><text start="7077.3" dur="3.14">but not for calculations</text><text start="7080.599" dur="3.261">um and</text><text start="7084.8" dur="6.0">what I want to bring in is that that</text><text start="7088.219" dur="6.301">there's an importance to this coming</text><text start="7090.8" dur="7.62">together of of learning and studying and</text><text start="7094.52" dur="8.24">and playing music and eating and having</text><text start="7098.42" dur="4.34">babies and this we need to do this</text><text start="7103.82" dur="6.299">understanding that what we are actually</text><text start="7105.92" dur="7.02">responding to at this point is run away</text><text start="7110.119" dur="4.381">which is really a different kind of</text><text start="7112.94" dur="4.799">response</text><text start="7114.5" dur="7.32">and I what I keep perceiving is that</text><text start="7117.739" dur="6.42">there's this grabbing need to pull one</text><text start="7121.82" dur="5.46">issue at a time</text><text start="7124.159" dur="5.821">and they're the it's in motion now they</text><text start="7127.28" dur="6.419">are we're in runaway we're in it</text><text start="7129.98" dur="6.48">so how do you how do you respond to</text><text start="7133.699" dur="4.681">Runaway collectively is actually also</text><text start="7136.46" dur="4.56">with runaway</text><text start="7138.38" dur="4.38">but run away of Another Kind like like</text><text start="7141.02" dur="3.179">run away</text><text start="7142.76" dur="3.12">like</text><text start="7144.199" dur="5.121">like people meeting people meeting</text><text start="7145.88" dur="5.819">people meeting people like the the the</text><text start="7149.32" dur="5.319">way in which</text><text start="7151.699" dur="5.281">if we have a conversation here</text><text start="7154.639" dur="3.841">and you guys all go home</text><text start="7156.98" dur="3.659">and you have a conversation with</text><text start="7158.48" dur="4.32">somebody that that conversation will be</text><text start="7160.639" dur="4.201">a little bit different</text><text start="7162.8" dur="3.96">and then that person talks to someone</text><text start="7164.84" dur="4.62">and it's a little bit different but</text><text start="7166.76" dur="6.359">something has this is the implicit part</text><text start="7169.46" dur="6.36">that something has shifted</text><text start="7173.119" dur="4.381">and maybe it's like really not the thing</text><text start="7175.82" dur="4.26">you thought</text><text start="7177.5" dur="3.84">maybe it's recognizing yeah those guys</text><text start="7180.08" dur="2.519">got up there and they were totally Off</text><text start="7181.34" dur="3.12">Script and they were actually in</text><text start="7182.599" dur="3.781">conversation</text><text start="7184.46" dur="4.02">and we don't see that very often maybe</text><text start="7186.38" dur="4.859">it's that</text><text start="7188.48" dur="5.54">I don't know that that Daniel came even</text><text start="7191.239" dur="2.781">though he was sick</text><text start="7194.06" dur="5.84">but seriously</text><text start="7195.739" dur="4.161">that's an act of love that's a gift</text><text start="7204.739" dur="5.88">so just recognizing how</text><text start="7207.8" dur="4.74">potent these nth order responses are in</text><text start="7210.619" dur="3.181">runaway because that's what we're what</text><text start="7212.54" dur="3.3">we're dealing with so I just wanted to</text><text start="7213.8" dur="5.6">bring that word in the room</text><text start="7215.84" dur="3.56">because I feel like it should be here</text><text start="7221.44" dur="7.0">had something I was feeling to share</text><text start="7224.239" dur="6.321">about the question of Hope optimism</text><text start="7228.44"

dur="3.661">we have to change the relationships</text><text start="8069.099" dur="3.12">because we're systems thinkers then we</text><text start="8071.26" dur="3.979">can say well we have to

start="8171.82" dur="4.62">broaden the conversation I don't know</text><text start="8173.92" dur="6.779">how to do that but so many of our words</text><text start="8176.44" dur="6.12">immediately set

in</text><text start="8207.219" dur="4.581">and you also are bringing in</text><text start="8210.88" dur="5.82">um</text><text start="8211.8" dur="6.52">this wonderful precision and this</text><text

dur="5.58">so there's part of what is interesting</text><text start="8262.78" dur="5.52">is what I might say or what Nate might</text><text start="8265.66" dur="5.88">say or what Daniel might say</text><text start="8268.3" dur="5.94">but I think what's really fascinating is</text><text start="8271.54" dur="7.939">what we didn't say but what actually</text><text start="8274.24"

dur="5.04">uh if the</text><text start="8494.859" dur="4.261">if there was an unbounded private</text><text start="8496.899" dur="4.08">property ownership the incentive would</text><text

on</text><text start="8514.479" dur="3.481">themselves much of the incentive would</text><text start="8516.34" dur="4.68">be gone</text><text start="8517.96" dur="5.04">if you think about a world before</text><text start="8521.02" dur="3.54">fungible currencies where you just had</text><text start="8523.0" dur="4.62">to have real</text><text start="8524.56" dur="5.64">or just say before currencies and you</text><text start="8527.62" dur="4.68">had real commodities</text><text start="8530.2" dur="3.42">a little bit of lumber is useful as you</text><text start="8532.3" dur="3.54">get more and more lumber you get a</text><text start="8533.62" dur="3.9">diminishing marginal value on the lumber</text><text start="8535.84" dur="3.059">because you can't use it you can't move</text><text start="8537.52" dur="3.12">it fast enough and it starts to just</text><text start="8538.899" dur="4.321">become like a big pain in the ass the</text><text start="8540.64" dur="4.5">same is true for or anything so you get</text><text start="8543.22" dur="5.099">kind of a diminishing return curve on</text><text start="8545.14" dur="5.339">the unit value of the thing</text><text start="8548.319" dur="4.561">but if I can sell the thing in real time</text><text start="8550.479" dur="4.801">to the market for currency which is an</text><text start="8552.88" dur="4.439">optionality token for any other kind of</text><text start="8555.28" dur="3.72">value and then I put interest on that</text><text start="8557.319" dur="3.54">where that thing not only can be</text><text start="8559.0" dur="4.319">converted instantly to any other thing</text><text start="8560.859" dur="4.261">that I want but it goes up exponentially</text><text start="8563.319" dur="4.201">just by sitting on it</text><text start="8565.12" dur="4.08">now there is an infinite incentive to</text><text start="8567.52" dur="5.339">acquire more there's never a diminishing</text><text start="8569.2" dur="5.76">return on acquiring more and in fact if</text><text start="8572.859" dur="3.661">I don't acquire more and the other guy</text><text start="8574.96" dur="4.2">does he's going to beat me</text><text start="8576.52" dur="4.56">so as long as you have a situation where</text><text start="8579.16" dur="4.38">you have a fungible currency

have</text><text start="8592.0" dur="4.58">to change those are very very deep I</text><text start="8594.399" dur="4.321">didn't just talk about</text><text start="8596.58" dur="4.3">glassdoal and gold

dur="3.3">um</text><text start="8605.02" dur="4.02">but those are examples that if there is</text><text start="8607.42" dur="3.24">going to be a civilization long term</text><text start="8609.04" dur="4.1">there won't still be those structures</text><text start="8610.66" dur="2.48">long term</text><text start="8617.14" dur="5.52">I don't think we will have a replicator</text><text
