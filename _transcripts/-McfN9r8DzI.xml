sort of complex chronic</text><text start="208.08" dur="7.019">illness which you managed through your</text><text start="210.48" dur="6.96">own efforts to address and and heal</text><text start="215.099" dur="3.961">and so through this you've you know</text><text start="217.44" dur="3.96">learned a huge amount about functional</text><text start="219.06" dur="4.08">medicine and Integrative Health and</text><text start="221.4" dur="5.04">you've helped set up functional medicine</text><text start="223.14" dur="6.12">clinics you've helped set up neuro</text><text start="226.44" dur="4.5">hacker Collective and you've developed</text><text start="229.26" dur="4.5">supplements you've been head of head of</text><text start="230.94" dur="6.299">r d there so you've done a very</text><text start="233.76" dur="6.0">wide-ranging number of things but what</text><text start="237.239" dur="4.86">I'd love to discuss with you today is is</text><text start="239.76" dur="5.16">really our Mental Health crisis you know</text><text start="242.099" dur="4.56">which is affecting so many of us on so</text><text start="244.92" dur="3.48">many levels and what I'm particularly</text><text start="246.659" dur="5.101">concerned about is the way it affects</text><text start="248.4" dur="4.919">our teens and our children and you know</text><text start="251.76" dur="4.86">in terms of statistics I mean the</text><text start="253.319" dur="4.741">statistics are mind-boggling but you</text><text start="256.62" dur="3.359">know and I won't go into them I mean we</text><text start="258.06" dur="3.78">know that one in five people is on a</text><text start="259.979" dur="4.081">mental health drug and that's people who</text><text start="261.84" dur="3.48">are clinically diagnosed and we know</text><text start="264.06" dur="2.52">that there are so many that are</text><text start="265.32" dur="2.64">subclinical</text><text start="266.58" dur="4.14">um and that haven't been officially</text><text start="267.96" dur="5.1">diagnosed we know that between 2000 and</text><text start="270.72" dur="5.46">2021 the rate of suicide in the US</text><text start="273.06" dur="5.46">increased by 36 percent we know that one</text><text start="276.18" dur="5.4">person dies every 11 minutes from</text><text start="278.52" dur="5.52">suicide and we also know that suicide is</text><text start="281.58" dur="7.2">the second leading cause of death in</text><text start="284.04" dur="6.54">those aged 10 to 14 and 20 to 34 as of</text><text start="288.78" dur="4.8">2023</text><text start="290.58" dur="5.82">. so you know those are just the suicide</text><text start="293.58" dur="5.46">statistics so what I'd love to ask you</text><text start="296.4" dur="4.56">about is you know what do you think this</text><text start="299.04" dur="4.32">is due to so</text><text start="300.96" dur="3.959">you know first of all we could talk</text><text start="303.36" dur="3.24">about you know what is mental health</text><text start="304.919" dur="4.801">what's your understanding of mental</text><text start="306.6" dur="5.76">health versus mental illness and second</text><text start="309.72" dur="3.96">of all is there an epidemic you know a</text><text start="312.36" dur="4.38">lot of people are talking about an</text><text start="313.68" dur="5.7">epidemic and mental health issues and if</text><text start="316.74" dur="4.019">so what is causing it and then what can</text><text start="319.38" dur="3.36">we do about it</text><text start="320.759" dur="4.821">he gets really really good to see you</text><text start="322.74" dur="2.84">and to be here with you and</text><text start="325.74" dur="6.06">and your focus on the future of mental</text><text start="329.16" dur="6.479">health and well-being being integrative</text><text start="331.8" dur="7.02">not just of all the domains of the</text><text start="335.639" dur="4.981">physiology that are involved but all the</text><text start="338.82" dur="4.439">domains of</text><text start="340.62" dur="6.24">psychology and the World At Large that</text><text start="343.259" dur="6.121">end up affecting our psychology is such</text><text start="346.86" dur="5.64">crucial work your over complementary to</text><text start="349.38" dur="4.379">me that uh kindness is one of the things</text><text start="352.5" dur="3.419">I like about you</text><text start="353.759" dur="3.361">and</text><text start="355.919" dur="3.84">uh</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.44">yeah so is there a health epidemic and</text><text start="359.759" dur="3.72">mental health epidemic and what is</text><text start="361.56" dur="3.24">mental health and</text><text start="363.479" dur="2.881">um</text><text start="364.8" dur="4.5">the first thought that came to me is</text><text start="366.36" dur="5.399">you're asking those questions was uh</text><text start="369.3" dur="3.6">I'm sure most of the people here are</text><text start="371.759" dur="2.72">familiar with the quote from</text><text start="372.9" dur="4.32">krishnamarti</text><text start="374.479" dur="4.66">uh that it is not a good measure of</text><text start="377.22" dur="3.84">mental health to be well adjusted to a</text><text start="379.139" dur="4.021">profoundly insane Society</text><text start="381.06" dur="4.5">and as we're addressing what mental</text><text start="383.16" dur="3.9">health is to start with what it's not</text><text start="385.56" dur="5.82">um</text><text start="387.06" dur="7.02">of course there was a time when the</text><text start="391.38" dur="5.879">most serious definition of mental</text><text start="394.08" dur="5.22">unhealth was being witch</text><text start="397.259" dur="4.201">meaning you know you were actually</text><text start="399.3" dur="4.32">possessed by the devil and doing the</text><text start="401.46" dur="4.5">work of the devil and you needed to be</text><text start="403.62" dur="5.54">burned at the stake and</text><text start="405.96" dur="5.94">uh I have a friend Samuel boria who</text><text start="409.16" dur="4.3">after the wall came down was able to get</text><text start="411.9" dur="3.6">a bunch of what had been previously</text><text start="413.46" dur="4.38">Soviet classified documents regarding</text><text start="415.5" dur="3.96">their mental health classification</text><text start="417.84" dur="3.9">system</text><text start="419.46" dur="4.5">in Yugoslavia I believe and it showed</text><text start="421.74" dur="6.78">that the</text><text start="423.96" dur="7.62">only paraphrases that the definition of</text><text start="428.52" dur="5.1">their equivalent of schizophrenia</text><text start="431.58" dur="5.16">uh it basically showed the</text><text start="433.62" dur="6.0">classification of how the</text><text start="436.74" dur="4.5">uh Military Intelligence influenced the</text><text start="439.62" dur="4.38">development of the psychiatric system</text><text start="441.24" dur="5.94">and psychiatric diagnosis</text><text start="444.0" dur="5.419">looking at things around paranoia and</text><text start="447.18" dur="6.0">that the definition of</text><text start="449.419" dur="7.301">schizophrenia or the equivalent</text><text start="453.18" dur="5.82">included paranoia about misuse of Power</text><text start="456.72" dur="4.919">by the state and that that was enough to</text><text start="459.0" dur="4.319">diagnose it and incarcerate someone</text><text start="461.639" dur="4.441">um and so</text><text start="463.319" dur="5.88">to some degree when you look at the</text><text start="466.08" dur="5.58">history of</text><text start="469.199" dur="4.921">um definitions of Mental Health</text><text start="471.66" dur="4.979">they have been</text><text start="474.12" dur="6.06">feeling good about the dominant society</text><text start="476.639" dur="5.101">in which you live because uh the</text><text start="480.18" dur="5.1">whatever the</text><text start="481.74" dur="6.299">power structure of that Society is would</text><text start="485.28" dur="5.94">not want everyone to feel otherwise you</text><text start="488.039" dur="5.701">can think about particularly patriotic</text><text start="491.22" dur="5.52">times in countries where</text><text start="493.74" dur="7.859">um a big part of being mentally healthy</text><text start="496.74" dur="6.0">was uh the Patriotic impulse</text><text start="501.599" dur="4.621">um</text><text start="502.74" dur="5.34">now we don't have fealty to religion or</text><text start="506.22" dur="5.22">state in quite the same way we used to</text><text start="508.08" dur="6.74">in much of the developed World currently</text><text start="511.44" dur="8.279">um it's almost more to like the market</text><text start="514.82" dur="7.779">and things like that so uh</text><text start="519.719" dur="6.18">so interestingly like if you are a good</text><text start="522.599" dur="5.941">consumer and you are inspired to</text><text start="525.899" dur="4.321">um continue to grow on the corporate</text><text start="528.54" dur="5.34">ladder and make more money and buy more</text><text start="530.22" dur="6.299">things and excited about the uh</text><text start="533.88" dur="4.079">results of your own productivity in</text><text start="536.519" dur="2.701">those measures you're pretty mentally</text><text start="537.959" dur="2.161">healthy</text><text start="539.22" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="540.12" dur="3.719">and I would of course not consider this</text><text start="542.1" dur="3.239">a good definition mental health and I</text><text start="543.839" dur="4.081">don't think it actually attracts to</text><text start="545.339" dur="4.44">Indian B underlying subjective</text><text start="547.92" dur="3.599">experiences or</text><text start="549.779" dur="4.081">you know to consider a person mentally</text><text start="551.519" dur="4.201">healthy I think not just how they</text><text start="553.86" dur="5.039">navigate their own experience of the</text><text start="555.72" dur="4.739">world but how they affect other people's</text><text start="558.899" dur="4.021">experience of the world and other life</text><text start="560.459" dur="5.101">forms experience of the world because we</text><text start="562.92" dur="6.539">can't see mental health and isolation</text><text start="565.56" dur="5.58">so if you you know you mentioned that uh</text><text start="569.459" dur="3.721">my primary work is on global</text><text start="571.14" dur="4.379">catastrophic risk and specifically we're</text><text start="573.18" dur="4.44">not just talking about like asteroids or</text><text start="575.519" dur="4.081">solar flares we're talking about global</text><text start="577.62" dur="5.159">catastrophic risk from</text><text start="579.6" dur="4.2">things that can go wrong with Advanced</text><text start="582.779" dur="4.74">Technologies like artificial</text><text start="583.8" dur="6.12">intelligence and synthetic biology about</text><text start="587.519" dur="3.661">all of the ecosystem issues where</text><text start="589.92" dur="3.78">obviously whether we're talking about</text><text start="591.18" dur="4.32">climate change or species Extinction or</text><text start="593.7" dur="4.02">biodiversity loss or dead zones and</text><text start="595.5" dur="4.86">oceans or desertification or</text><text start="597.72" dur="4.38">all the issues that come from unrinobily</text><text start="600.36" dur="3.599">using

start="605.339" dur="6.981">faster than the earth can deal with them</text><text start="608.76" dur="5.94">human society as structured is actually</text><text start="612.32" dur="4.66">debasing the

start="619.56" dur="3.66">its own self-termination and it's very</text><text start="621.18" dur="5.64">hard to say that's the same Society it</text><text start="623.22" dur="6.84">is actually a

dur="4.62">and so</text><text start="634.14" dur="4.259">um and if you look at how many species</text><text start="636.48" dur="5.039">go extinct per day as a result of human</text><text start="638.399" dur="6.0">activity if you look at</text><text start="641.519" dur="4.621">how many animals are in the most extreme</text><text start="644.399" dur="4.921">gruesome suffering possible in factory</text><text start="646.14" dur="5.819">farms if you look at</text><text start="649.32" dur="4.62">how many people's lives are in</text><text start="651.959" dur="4.921">unnecessarily terrible conditions as a</text><text start="653.94" dur="6.36">result of uh</text><text start="656.88" dur="5.88">social systems it's</text><text start="660.3" dur="3.599">it's hard and you also look at the fact</text><text start="662.76" dur="3.24">that</text><text start="663.899" dur="6.421">uh</text><text start="666.0" dur="6.5">from a deep analysis if we</text><text start="670.32" dur="5.82">if we were to solve climate change from</text><text start="672.5" dur="5.98">particularly CO2 issues it buys almost</text><text start="676.14" dur="4.08">no time because the dead zones in

dur="6.06">Industrial fluent and the overfishing is</text><text start="685.98" dur="4.799">not from CO2 and the</text><text start="688.56" dur="4.08">um deforestation is not in the there are</text><text start="690.779" dur="3.381">actually so many different things that</text><text start="692.64" dur="3.3">are on the path to</text><text start="694.16" dur="3.22">self-induced

dur="5.221">saying is you know there are a lot of</text><text start="1077.539" dur="5.76">aspects to unpack so you know you can</text><text start="1080.9" dur="4.019">look at the physiological aspects which</text><text start="1083.299" dur="3.901">are you know that we're creating a</text><text start="1084.919" dur="4.321">climate crisis there's soil erosion</text><text start="1087.2"

dur="4.8">neurotransmitters Etc you can look at</text><text start="1102.5" dur="3.539">the fact that we're taking all these</text><text start="1103.88" dur="4.98">antibiotics that they're pesticides that</text><text start="1106.039" dur="5.101">they're unprecedented levels of toxic</text><text start="1108.86" dur="4.559">chemicals in our environment</text><text start="1111.14" dur="4.86">and these are all messing up the gut</text><text start="1113.419" dur="5.281">microbiome and therefore having a huge</text><text start="1116.0" dur="4.74">impact on our mental health so those are</text><text start="1118.7" dur="4.8">sort of the physiological aspects so</text><text start="1120.74" dur="5.22">high levels of toxicity you know poor</text><text start="1123.5" dur="4.799">nutrition which are all impacting the</text><text start="1125.96" dur="4.56">individual's mental health but then from</text><text start="1128.299" dur="4.441">a sociological and sort of psychological</text><text start="1130.52" dur="6.48">perspective there's also a sort of</text><text start="1132.74" dur="7.74">dissolution of our communities there's a</text><text start="1137.0" dur="6.14">you know sort of competitiveness and a</text><text start="1140.48" dur="5.88">sense of disintegration in some sense</text><text start="1143.14" dur="5.98">that is affecting you know all all</text><text start="1146.36" dur="4.559">humans essentially but in a way it's</text><text start="1149.12" dur="3.78">like the boiling frog right we're not</text><text start="1150.919" dur="4.38">really aware of it because we're in it</text><text start="1152.9" dur="4.86">all the time day in day out and so we're</text><text start="1155.299" dur="5.461">being bombarded not just

also sociological and psychological</text><text start="1166.22" dur="4.5">ones and would you say then that the</text><text start="1169.1" dur="3.959">crisis in mental health is sort of a</text><text

even mentioned social</text><text start="1177.799" dur="5.341">media and technology and the sort of 24</text><text start="1180.679" dur="5.041">7 connectivity so you have the Paradox</text><text

beautiful so a few things</text><text start="3343.5" dur="5.28">I just want to um pick up on is you know</text><text start="3347.22" dur="2.76">you talk about attention and the</text><text

about all</text><text start="3370.8" dur="4.08">these measurable you know things</text><text start="3372.599" dur="4.921">measuring things and you know that</text><text start="3374.88"

is</text><text start="3424.859" dur="3.601">that you know all these lab tests and</text><text start="3426.78" dur="4.14">you know maybe that's opening too much</text><text start="3428.46"

end up needing</text><text start="3499.559" dur="5.581">other drugs later saying let's go</text><text start="3501.72" dur="5.66">upstream and say is that rheumatism</text><text start="3505.14" dur="4.199">actually</text><text start="3507.38" dur="3.459">resultant or at least partially</text><text start="3509.339" dur="3.661">resulting from some underlying</text><text start="3510.839"

thing</text><text start="3515.64" dur="4.679">so in that way it's a movement towards</text><text start="3518.099" dur="6.96">increased considerateness right kind of</text><text start="3520.319" dur="6.361">like GDP plus Genie coefficients plus a</text><text start="3525.059" dur="2.941">carbon accounting right it's like adding</text><text start="3526.68" dur="3.419">additional things so that you aren't</text><text start="3528.0" dur="4.5">externalizing or neglecting or whatever</text><text start="3530.099" dur="5.401">in that area</text><text start="3532.5" dur="4.559">so that's good right and rather than</text><text start="3535.5" dur="3.24">simply say well we have no idea why you</text><text start="3537.059" dur="3.3">have rheumatism and so we're just going</text><text start="3538.74" dur="3.3">to do symptomatic treatment to be able</text><text start="3540.359" dur="2.94">to say well there are these things that</text><text start="3542.04" dur="3.42">are going on Upstream that at least</text><text start="3543.299" dur="4.26">sometimes statistically correlate with</text><text start="3545.46" dur="3.48">increased chance of rheumatism whether</text><text start="3547.559" dur="2.581">it's the Lyme thing or the Mercury thing</text><text start="3548.94" dur="2.28">or whatever let's go ahead and work on</text><text start="3550.14" dur="3.24">those see what happens sometimes</text><text start="3551.22" dur="4.079">rheumatism goes away but whether it's</text><text start="3553.38" dur="3.479">Mercury or whether it's lead you're</text><text start="3555.299" dur="2.941">going to use different chelating agents</text><text start="3556.859" dur="3.061">to be able to deal with it and whether</text><text start="3558.24" dur="3.839">it's Lyme or EBV you'll use different</text><text start="3559.92" dur="4.08">infectious agents to deal with it so</text><text start="3562.079" dur="3.54">there's some value in that totally I</text><text start="3564.0" dur="4.4">think this is fantastic</text><text start="3565.619" dur="2.781">and</text><text start="3570.599" dur="3.48">we were so excited in the Human Genome</text><text

dur="4.56">sitting with someone without having to</text><text start="5502.179" dur="4.621">distract and whether you're sitting with</text><text start="5504.88" dur="3.66">them you know in whatever suffering</text><text start="5506.8" dur="4.14">they're they're in whether it's mental</text><text start="5508.54" dur="4.5">suffering or physical suffering and just</text><text start="5510.94"

give</text><text start="5516.88" dur="5.16">them love I think that you know those</text><text start="5518.62" dur="5.94">are really important Concepts and and</text><text start="5522.04" dur="4.619">and an important approach that we do</text><text start="5524.56" dur="4.44">tend to forget you know as people who</text><text start="5526.659" dur="5.161">are trying to heal you know heal

like</text><text start="5956.26" dur="4.439">it was so interesting because what like</text><text start="5958.6" dur="4.26">what one person would do to show love</text><text start="5960.699"

that</text><text start="5965.199" dur="4.801">would have worked for them and so again</text><text start="5967.78" dur="4.2">the person says that they're depressed</text><text start="5970.0" dur="4.139">they want to take their life</text><text start="5971.98" dur="4.14">I've wanted to take my life</text><text start="5974.139" dur="3.54">maybe they're similar maybe they're not</text><text start="5976.12" dur="4.079">similar at all</text><text start="5977.679" dur="4.801">right maybe it is that there's a part of</text><text start="5980.199" dur="4.741">them that needs to die</text><text

start="6158.699" dur="6.0">go as far as he did in all the ways that</text><text start="6161.88" dur="7.759">he did given what he came from is so</text><text start="6164.699" dur="4.94">remarkable you

that</text><text start="6205.739" dur="5.221">he and I had the</text><text start="6208.38" dur="4.38">end of life conversations many many many</text><text start="6210.96" dur="4.739">times</text><text start="6212.76" dur="6.959">um and so that was uniquely fortunate we</text><text start="6215.699" dur="4.98">got to I I wrote an article of uh thing</text><text start="6219.719" dur="3.061">to say</text><text start="6220.679" dur="3.841">specifically this was years ago I framed</text><text start="6222.78" dur="3.54">things I learned about being a man from</text><text start="6224.52" dur="4.02">my dad because</text><text start="6226.32" dur="4.08">um it looked like he might dive in and I</text><text start="6228.54" dur="3.48">figured why wait to do the eulogy when</text><text start="6230.4" dur="3.719">the person can't read it by not saying</text><text start="6232.02" dur="5.34">things they can but then I kind of</text><text start="6234.119" dur="5.881">double purposed it with of his teachings</text><text start="6237.36" dur="4.62">in parenting how many of them were</text><text start="6240.0" dur="3.6">particularly useful for a son and how</text><text start="6241.98" dur="3.659">much I looked around and saw how many</text><text start="6243.6" dur="5.34">people either had didn't have fathers or</text><text start="6245.639" dur="5.401">had inadequate fathers and how many of</text><text start="6248.94" dur="5.16">the men in particular who had an</text><text start="6251.04" dur="5.28">adequate fathers</text><text start="6254.1" dur="3.72">um how many of the problems in the world</text><text start="6256.32" dur="4.2">were caused by that</text><text start="6257.82" dur="4.44">um and so I figured if some tiny</text><text start="6260.52" dur="3.3">vicarious

dur="4.259">where of course if somebody dies you can</text><text start="6334.199" dur="3.841">still come to make peace and come to</text><text start="6336.119" dur="3.301">forgiveness and whatever but it's not</text><text start="6338.04" dur="4.679">quite the same</text><text start="6339.42" dur="5.46">and so I was supporting family members</text><text start="6342.719" dur="5.041">knowing that death was imminent to come</text><text start="6344.88" dur="5.279">to complete things and in doing so I</text><text start="6347.76" dur="5.359">found that I understood where they were</text><text start="6350.159" dur="2.96">at less than I thought</text><text start="6353.58" dur="3.96">um I got to find how actually far from</text><text start="6356.159" dur="3.06">the piece that I was hoping they would</text><text start="6357.54" dur="3.54">come who they were how many more steps</text><text start="6359.219" dur="3.841">were needed and that I hadn't asked</text><text start="6361.08" dur="3.36">enough questions to know</text><text start="6363.06" dur="3.54">because</text><text start="6364.44" dur="3.54">with a new person I would ask all these</text><text start="6366.6" dur="3.3">questions but I think with a family</text><text start="6367.98" dur="4.08">member we assume like oh I know what you</text><text start="6369.9" dur="4.2">went through we were there together nope</text><text start="6372.06" dur="4.46">you know we were in totally different</text><text start="6374.1" dur="5.519">experiences so that was really</text><text start="6376.52"

article also years ago</text><text start="6390.179" dur="5.761">from the experiences I'd had with other</text><text start="6392.58" dur="4.74">people and a lot of friends called uh</text><text

few more</text><text start="6403.08" dur="6.059">things to it now but um</text><text start="6407.28" dur="6.06">and there's definitely been really</text><text start="6409.139" dur="6.54">interesting experiences in both the loss</text><text start="6413.34" dur="5.16">in the human domain and the even deeper</text><text start="6415.679" dur="6.621">Connection in one might call a

dur="4.259">the</text><text start="6427.56" dur="4.74">what do I wish I had known earlier that</text><text start="6429.659" dur="4.761">I would do a little differently</text><text start="6432.3" dur="2.12">um</text><text start="6435.179" dur="3.121">um</text><text start="6435.78" dur="4.08">the conversations in recent years we've</text><text start="6438.3" dur="3.0">had that I'm happiest about were the</text><text start="6439.86" dur="2.759">ones where</text><text start="6441.3" dur="3.48">he</text><text start="6442.619" dur="4.141">shared things that he wanted to share</text><text start="6444.78" dur="3.48">and made the time to take them and I</text><text start="6446.76" dur="3.72">appreciated him</text><text start="6448.26" dur="5.04">and</text><text start="6450.48" dur="4.139">you know that's it's not a trivial thing</text><text start="6453.3" dur="3.18">because</text><text start="6454.619" dur="5.161">like a lot of</text><text start="6456.48" dur="6.9">people who have families or</text><text start="6459.78" dur="5.339">careers or passion projects you know I'm</text><text start="6463.38" dur="4.44">time is limited</text><text start="6465.119" dur="4.981">and many of the things that he wants me</text><text start="6467.82" dur="3.6">he wanted to share with me were things</text><text start="6470.1" dur="4.68">that he had already shared with me many</text><text start="6471.42" dur="8.12">times and that I had and some of them</text><text start="6474.78" dur="4.76">were mixed with some of the uh</text><text start="6480.719" dur="4.681">you know wounded parts or whatever that</text><text start="6483.179" dur="4.201">made it a little harder to</text><text start="6485.4" dur="3.06">just be</text><text start="6487.38" dur="4.38">um</text><text start="6488.46" dur="6.36">stoked on and yet</text><text start="6491.76" dur="5.22">so it's so interesting because like</text><text start="6494.82" dur="4.62">the times where he was happiest were not</text><text start="6496.98" dur="4.32">where anybody was offering him help or</text><text start="6499.44" dur="3.12">support and not even compassion for</text><text start="6501.3" dur="3.18">anybody he was going through but where</text><text start="6502.56" dur="3.179">he got to offer something that other</text><text start="6504.48" dur="2.639">people needed because without which</text><text start="6505.739" dur="2.88">there was no meaning and the only reason</text><text start="6507.119" dur="2.961">for him to continue was to have some</text><text start="6508.619" dur="7.261">sense of meaning</text><text start="6510.08" dur="8.8">and so the times that I</text><text start="6515.88" dur="5.46">the conversations we had that I feel</text><text start="6518.88" dur="5.04">the least good about were the ones where</text><text start="6521.34" dur="4.379">I was trying to help him improve himself</text><text start="6523.92" dur="4.44">and heal himself</text><text start="6525.719" dur="4.561">that didn't end up working and they were</text><text start="6528.36" dur="3.54">ultimately just not even though they</text><text start="6530.28" dur="4.14">were intended out of wanting him to</text><text start="6531.9" dur="5.1">suffer less and be happier that were</text><text start="6534.42" dur="4.259">some lack of calibration on my part of</text><text start="6537.0" dur="5.699">what was where he was really at what was</text><text start="6538.679" dur="6.421">really possible and that</text><text start="6542.699" dur="3.54">in the time where I was trying to help</text><text start="6545.1" dur="2.7">motivate so I was thinking about</text><text start="6546.239" dur="4.621">motivational psychology right help</text><text start="6547.8" dur="4.74">motivate some behavior that would cause</text><text start="6550.86" dur="3.48">some less suffering on his part which is</text><text start="6552.54" dur="3.599">easy to want to do when the person is</text><text start="6554.34" dur="3.24">really really abjectly suffering for</text><text start="6556.139" dur="3.721">something that could behaviorally change</text><text start="6557.58" dur="4.5">supposedly</text><text start="6559.86" dur="3.48">but also kind of can't in any way right</text><text start="6562.08" dur="3.119">and</text><text start="6563.34" dur="4.02">I think when someone has a very broken</text><text start="6565.199" dur="3.661">sense of agency in a domain and someone</text><text start="6567.36" dur="2.94">else doesn't have a broken sense of</text><text start="6568.86" dur="3.6">agency in that domain it's hard to</text><text start="6570.3" dur="4.58">empathize properly which would happen</text><text start="6572.46" dur="2.42">for me</text><text start="6574.92" dur="5.759">um at that same time spent</text><text start="6577.98" dur="4.259">him getting to share things with me that</text><text start="6580.679" dur="3.48">were important for him to share would</text><text start="6582.239" dur="5.281">have been a better use of time</text><text start="6584.159" dur="6.06">and uh so that's that's one reflection</text><text start="6587.52" dur="4.38">well that's really beautiful I mean I'm</text><text start="6590.219" dur="3.721">sure you have a lot more but that's very</text><text start="6591.9" dur="4.319">beautiful and I mean what if I'm if I</text><text start="6593.94" dur="6.48">wanted to synthesize our conversation</text><text start="6596.219" dur="5.701">and bring it back to mental health I um</text><text start="6600.42" dur="4.56">you know one of the things that really</text><text start="6601.92" dur="5.4">strikes me is that the whole thread of</text><text start="6604.98" dur="3.48">what you're saying seems to me to be</text><text start="6607.32" dur="4.5">about</text><text start="6608.46" dur="7.04">you know a deep listening and a deep</text><text start="6611.82" dur="5.46">connection and a deep attention</text><text start="6615.5" dur="5.8">to</text><text start="6617.28" dur="7.68">to people and to the planet and to the</text><text start="6621.3" dur="5.46">needs of others as opposed to in some</text><text start="6624.96" dur="4.08">sense our own needs I mean we're in this</text><text start="6626.76" dur="4.14">sort of hyper individualistic Society</text><text start="6629.04" dur="4.5">where it's all about self-care and</text><text start="6630.9" dur="4.319">looking after ourselves and what are our</text><text start="6633.54" dur="3.42">needs and what are our needs going to be</text><text start="6635.219" dur="3.121">met and there's this whole movement what</text><text start="6636.96" dur="3.719">I'm hearing from you is something</text><text start="6638.34" dur="5.06">slightly different which is you know</text><text start="6640.679" dur="5.881">really connect to the needs of others</text><text start="6643.4" dur="6.64">and to the needs of the planet and don't</text><text start="6646.56" dur="6.72">try and superimpose your own ideas about</text><text start="6650.04" dur="5.9">how to fix them or what they need but</text><text start="6653.28" dur="5.7">truly a sort of quality of listening</text><text start="6655.94" dur="5.62">which you know can only be equated to</text><text start="6658.98" dur="8.219">you know really listening with love</text><text start="6661.56" dur="9.059">yeah and you know and in that is healing</text><text start="6667.199" dur="5.581">and so you know you just said something</text><text start="6670.619" dur="5.1">really important which is</text><text start="6672.78" dur="5.76">in the Deep listening there is healing</text><text start="6675.719" dur="4.861">even before the person listening gets</text><text start="6678.54" dur="4.98">the data to know what healing therapy to</text><text start="6680.58" dur="6.36">do yes right just in the connectivity</text><text start="6683.52" dur="5.78">there's healing exactly you can think of</text><text start="6686.94" dur="5.34">increased</text><text start="6689.3" dur="4.419">connectivity as being key to what</text><text start="6692.28" dur="4.68">healing means</text><text start="6693.719" dur="6.061">and and yet also in you</text><text start="6696.96" dur="4.62">in the utility sense that deep listening</text><text start="6699.78" dur="3.839">will give us a better Insight what other</text><text start="6701.58" dur="3.72">things would be helpful both are true it</text><text start="6703.619" dur="3.181">is healing itself and it empowers</text><text start="6705.3" dur="3.78">healing that is more attuned and</text><text start="6706.8" dur="4.439">calibrated</text><text start="6709.08" dur="4.619">um but I would say it's not</text><text start="6711.239" dur="5.101">others more than self self is a part of</text><text start="6713.699" dur="4.44">the whole right uh</text><text start="6716.34" dur="2.879">I would say most people don't have it</text><text start="6718.139" dur="3.181">deep enough</text><text start="6719.219" dur="3.96">listening like this with their own self</text><text start="6721.32" dur="4.5">because they go too quickly into what is</text><text start="6723.179" dur="4.921">the Fix-It thing</text><text start="6725.82" dur="5.04">um or they go too quickly into also what</text><text start="6728.1" dur="5.22">is the coping strategy and the</text><text start="6730.86" dur="3.9">um or moralizing themselves to do the</text><text start="6733.32" dur="3.18">right Behavior the way their parents did</text><text start="6734.76" dur="3.18">which is their internal parent voice not</text><text start="6736.5" dur="4.44">that kind of higher self Voice or</text><text start="6737.94" dur="5.16">whatever and to sit deeper with like</text><text start="6740.94" dur="3.9">where does this</text><text start="6743.1" dur="3.72">feeling come from can I what's under</text><text start="6744.84" dur="4.98">that feeling it's under that one when</text><text start="6746.82" dur="5.76">did I first feel this that process of</text><text start="6749.82" dur="5.339">self attention and listening and love</text><text start="6752.58" dur="4.2">with self I think is a huge part</text><text start="6755.159" dur="2.941">of how the authentic healing happens</text><text start="6756.78" dur="3.419">also</text><text start="6758.1" dur="3.48">and that is so true and then one of the</text><text start="6760.199" dur="2.94">things that occurs to me when you're</text><text start="6761.58" dur="3.96">talking about this is one of the real</text><text start="6763.139" dur="4.681">problems with social media and with</text><text start="6765.54" dur="3.86">technology is that the listening is</text><text start="6767.82" dur="5.76">really one way</text><text start="6769.4" dur="6.1">and you know we're the technology and</text><text start="6773.58" dur="5.579">the social media is not listening to us</text><text start="6775.5" dur="5.46">we're listening to it and</text><text start="6779.159" dur="4.08">you know so there's there's this sort of</text><text start="6780.96" dur="5.82">real disconnection and this real</text><text start="6783.239" dur="6.121">breakdown of bilateral communication</text><text start="6786.78" dur="4.919">which you know in some ways I come out</text><text start="6789.36" dur="5.54">more pessimistic about it than I went in</text><text start="6791.699" dur="3.201">after talking to you</text><text start="6795.119" dur="3.0">well</text><text start="6796.44" dur="4.44">yeah</text><text start="6798.119" dur="4.681">there was a study done by Harvard</text><text start="6800.88" dur="3.54">psychology department that I remember</text><text start="6802.8" dur="4.2">reading many years ago I don't remember</text><text start="6804.42" dur="5.4">all the details or the gist I found this</text><text start="6807.0" dur="6.119">so fascinating was</text><text start="6809.82" dur="4.74">they had people go on dates with two</text><text start="6813.119" dur="3.661">different kinds of people but the people</text><text start="6814.56" dur="4.32">it was blinded where the people who were</text><text start="6816.78" dur="3.3">going on the date did not double-blinded</text><text start="6818.88" dur="3.72">the people who were going on the date</text><text start="6820.08" dur="4.5">didn't know what the two different types</text><text start="6822.6" dur="4.74">of people were that were being tested</text><text start="6824.58" dur="4.559">and the other people that were the types</text><text start="6827.34" dur="3.54">of people being dated didn't know what</text><text start="6829.139" dur="3.901">thing they were a subclass of or that</text><text start="6830.88" dur="3.66">they were an incident class of but the</text><text start="6833.04" dur="3.599">key was</text><text start="6834.54" dur="3.84">they had</text><text start="6836.639" dur="4.381">um the test audience date someone who</text><text start="6838.38" dur="4.859">was very interesting</text><text start="6841.02" dur="4.92">and kind of like would generally be</text><text start="6843.239" dur="4.98">considered very interesting that they</text><text start="6845.94" dur="4.08">had spoke seven languages had a bunch of</text><text start="6848.219" dur="3.181">degrees had great stories had been all</text><text start="6850.02" dur="4.26">around the world whatever things like</text><text start="6851.4" dur="4.62">that and they had them go on a date with</text><text start="6854.28" dur="3.359">someone who was very interested someone</text><text start="6856.02" dur="3.599">who was fascinated and asked questions</text><text start="6857.639" dur="3.06">was like oh my God you did that and tell</text><text start="6859.619" dur="3.961">me more</text><text start="6860.699" dur="4.98">and without telling the people that that</text><text start="6863.58" dur="3.3">was the defining characteristic then</text><text start="6865.679" dur="2.641">they asked them afterwards about their</text><text start="6866.88" dur="3.18">experience in dates and you can already</text><text start="6868.32" dur="2.94">guess by the smile</text><text start="6870.06" dur="2.46">they're like well what was your</text><text start="6871.26" dur="2.76">experience with this person the</text><text start="6872.52" dur="2.639">interesting person like man that person</text><text start="6874.02" dur="2.46">was interesting they were fascinating</text><text start="6875.159" dur="2.58">they did all these things it was amazing</text><text start="6876.48" dur="2.46">it was kind of an honor to even get to</text><text start="6877.739" dur="2.46">hear the stories</text><text start="6878.94" dur="3.36">do you want to go on another date with</text><text start="6880.199" dur="3.781">them you know what as amazing as they</text><text start="6882.3" dur="3.18">were</text><text start="6883.98" dur="3.179">I didn't feel like there was really a</text><text start="6885.48" dur="4.62">spark between us there was kind of no</text><text start="6887.159" dur="4.921">yeah and so they it was no and then with</text><text start="6890.1" dur="3.24">the other person</text><text start="6892.08" dur="3.72">do you want to go on a date with them</text><text start="6893.34" dur="4.44">again they're like yeah totally there</text><text start="6895.8" dur="3.54">was just this genese call I can't even</text><text start="6897.78"

start="6903.0" dur="5.04">so in real interaction someone can</text><text start="6906.239" dur="5.94">respond to the quality of your listening</text><text start="6908.04" dur="6.54">right and now in social media I get</text><text start="6912.179" dur="4.5">likes for what I said</text><text start="6914.58" dur="3.9">I get reshares on what I said I don't</text><text start="6916.679" dur="4.56">get anything for how well I listened</text><text start="6918.48" dur="4.02">right it's not that the social media</text><text start="6921.239" dur="2.88">platform doesn't listen it actually</text><text start="6922.5" dur="3.239">listens like a which is how</text><text start="6924.119" dur="3.301">it can Harvest all the information about</text><text start="6925.739" dur="2.88">my click patterns and

dur="4.261">documentary they were the family members</text><text start="7776.48" dur="4.44">they die and they're like my whole life</text><text start="7779.36" dur="3.54">is meaningless I'm doing all the</text><text start="7780.92" dur="3.96">things wrong what that person said they</text><text start="7782.9" dur="3.839">would redo differently I am set up to</text><text start="7784.88" dur="4.58">live my life right eye with a huge</text><text start="7786.739" dur="2.721">amount of regret</text><text start="7789.8" dur="5.339">and then they will lose that awareness</text><text

so</text><text start="7798.56" dur="4.2">as soon as they come back on this thing</text><text start="7800.599" dur="4.741">and scroll for 15 minutes</text><text start="7802.76" dur="4.68">all that's gone right the the awareness</text><text start="7805.34" dur="3.779">has to have an attention span to it or</text><text start="7807.44" dur="5.759">it has to have an environment that keeps</text><text

start="7866.06" dur="3.599">do I hold it you know</text><text start="7868.04" dur="3.3">used to be something like go to church</text><text start="7869.659" dur="3.06">every Sunday you have some way

dur="5.16">um</text><text start="7876.38" dur="7.2">the very tangible thing is start</text><text start="7881.0" dur="4.739">ing yourself with people who already are</text><text start="7883.58" dur="4.26">more</text><text start="7885.739" dur="3.841">because the environment of information</text><text start="7887.84" dur="3.66">you take in in the social environment</text><text start="7889.58" dur="3.599">you take in will affect you and the</text><text start="7891.5" dur="3.42">things that you do to try to affect</text><text start="7893.179" dur="5.04">yourself independent of that will be</text><text start="7894.92" dur="7.62">kind of swimming Upstream</text><text start="7898.219" dur="6.601">so if you can pay attention to in the</text><text start="7902.54" dur="4.38">moments of

would be continuously in my</text><text start="7921.08" dur="4.92">mind as opposed to only rarely in my</text><text start="7922.94" dur="6.54">mind uh that's one thing that will make</text><text
