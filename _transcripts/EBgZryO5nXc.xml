framework</text><text start="4.38" dur="4.98">by Daniel schmuckenberger that we keep</text><text start="6.299" dur="5.641">talking about in our in our sessions</text><text start="9.36" dur="6.0">so Dennis martinberger recorded two</text><text start="11.94" dur="4.86">videos on the rebel wisdom podcast and</text><text start="15.36" dur="4.08">called it in search of the third</text><text start="16.8" dur="4.559">attractor meaning that we&apos;re steering</text><text start="19.44" dur="3.78">towards two attractors currently we&apos;ll</text><text start="21.359" dur="4.381">talk about later in the series or in</text><text start="23.22" dur="4.2">this video and looking for the third</text><text start="25.74" dur="3.84">attractor what that could even be he</text><text start="27.42" dur="4.439">doesn&apos;t have the solutions he just wants</text><text start="29.58" dur="4.56">to point out what the criteria Etc could</text><text start="31.859" dur="4.081">even look like so first of all what is</text><text start="34.14" dur="4.38">this video series about here you see the</text><text start="35.94" dur="4.92">thumbnail of the first video</text><text start="38.52" dur="4.199">he calls it an overview so it&apos;s not the</text><text start="40.86" dur="3.96">specific details it&apos;s not the solutions</text><text start="42.719" dur="4.441">it&apos;s just an overview on some of the</text><text start="44.82" dur="5.52">catastrophic wrists the current the</text><text start="47.16" dur="6.12">world currently faces and what could be</text><text start="50.34" dur="5.58">criteria for potential solutions to what</text><text start="53.28" dur="4.86">he calls The Meta crisis so this is in</text><text start="55.92" dur="3.6">short what it is about</text><text start="58.14" dur="3.48">um so what are we going to talk about in</text><text start="59.52" dur="3.839">this video first I want to point out a</text><text start="61.62" dur="4.44">couple important Frameworks before we go</text><text start="63.359" dur="4.08">into the depth of the the knowledge I</text><text start="66.06" dur="3.599">want to talk about the catastrophic</text><text start="67.439" dur="4.141">risks we&apos;re currently facing but the</text><text start="69.659" dur="4.741">meta crisis real quick the two current</text><text start="71.58" dur="5.34">attractors that we&apos;re going towards and</text><text start="74.4" dur="4.98">a possible phototractor what criteria</text><text start="76.92" dur="4.44">could be what tools could be Etc so</text><text start="79.38" dur="3.48">let&apos;s start one of the important</text><text start="81.36" dur="3.0">Frameworks he talks about is the great</text><text start="82.86" dur="4.02">game of power</text><text start="84.36" dur="4.259">so we hear about a lot of</text><text start="86.88" dur="4.5">um yeah</text><text start="88.619" dur="6.421">games being played but who the actual</text><text start="91.38" dur="6.18">big uh participants in the game are</text><text start="95.04" dur="4.14">Up For Debate I would say so he points</text><text start="97.56" dur="4.68">out a couple of criterias or three</text><text start="99.18" dur="4.92">criterias what people that want to</text><text start="102.24" dur="5.16">participate in this great game of power</text><text start="104.1" dur="6.36">globally need to have so some nuclear</text><text start="107.4" dur="6.359">capability is one of the Surefire uh</text><text start="110.46" dur="5.04">criteria so if you have nuclear bombs</text><text start="113.759" dur="3.241">like you will be part of the great game</text><text start="115.5" dur="3.299">of power</text><text start="117.0" dur="3.72">um some ability to influence Innovative</text><text start="118.799" dur="3.96">governmental organizations is part of it</text><text start="120.72" dur="4.499">as well or dominating one or more</text><text start="122.759" dur="3.18">aspects of exponential Tech because that</text><text start="125.219" dur="2.54">is</text><text start="125.939" dur="4.861">um as we&apos;re going to hear quite a bit</text><text start="127.759" dur="4.661">one of the key aspects to many aspects</text><text start="130.8" dur="4.62">of the meta crisis</text><text start="132.42" dur="4.92">so what kind of strategic actors are</text><text start="135.42" dur="5.16">part of this game great game of power we</text><text start="137.34" dur="4.86">have hyper individ uh hyper agents which</text><text start="140.58" dur="4.08">are individuals</text><text start="142.2" dur="4.259">um think of Putin Biden I mean there&apos;s</text><text start="144.66" dur="3.6">many behind the scenes as well but just</text><text start="146.459" dur="5.28">individual people that have a lot of</text><text start="148.26" dur="6.9">power uh either influencing governments</text><text start="151.739" dur="5.461">or dominating some part of exponential</text><text start="155.16" dur="4.98">tact we obviously have institutions like</text><text start="157.2" dur="4.8">the CIA and we have agrigors which are</text><text start="160.14" dur="3.9">nothing but the mimetic tribes if you</text><text start="162.0" dur="3.42">don&apos;t know about medic tribes there&apos;s a</text><text start="164.04" dur="3.839">great</text><text start="165.42" dur="3.959">um article on by the store I think it&apos;s</text><text start="167.879" dur="3.661">on medium</text><text start="169.379" dur="4.44">where he explains what the medic tribes</text><text start="171.54" dur="4.62">are what we have there&apos;s over 30 tribes</text><text start="173.819" dur="3.78">in today&apos;s world super interesting um</text><text start="176.16" dur="4.26">check that out</text><text start="177.599" dur="4.741">okay what are multiple traps</text><text start="180.42" dur="3.66">um multi-polar traps are basically</text><text start="182.34" dur="5.34">something where there&apos;s a perverse</text><text start="184.08" dur="5.64">incentive and I have to use it otherwise</text><text start="187.68" dur="3.72">the other person does it and I just</text><text start="189.72" dur="3.96">simply lose out and I&apos;m not part of the</text><text start="191.4" dur="4.559">game anymore so what what he often</text><text start="193.68" dur="4.86">mentions is a first mover advantage</text><text start="195.959" dur="4.64">for example cutting a forest down if I</text><text start="198.54" dur="4.619">don&apos;t cut the forest down then my</text><text start="200.599" dur="4.481">competitor will do it we&apos;ll do it just</text><text start="203.159" dur="3.481">as quickly he will have all the gains</text><text start="205.08" dur="4.739">and be able to even cut more of the</text><text start="206.64" dur="6.12">forest down so if I don&apos;t cut the forest</text><text start="209.819" dur="4.681">down as well and just as fast then I</text><text start="212.76" dur="4.38">will just lose out to him and the force</text><text start="214.5" dur="4.459">will be cut down anyways something some</text><text start="217.14" dur="4.86">another example is the penal</text><text start="218.959" dur="5.5">penalization for risk assessment</text><text start="222.0" dur="4.799">so if I want to be the first to market</text><text start="224.459" dur="5.221">then I will have a huge advantage over</text><text start="226.799" dur="4.981">my competitors but if I want to be sure</text><text start="229.68" dur="3.839">that there&apos;s not any any risks involved</text><text start="231.78" dur="5.16">that I don&apos;t know of yet and I want to</text><text start="233.519" dur="5.341">do a real solid risk assessment first I</text><text start="236.94" dur="3.9">again I just lose out the competitor who</text><text start="238.86" dur="3.42">doesn&apos;t do it is first to the market has</text><text start="240.84" dur="4.679">a huge advantage</text><text start="242.28" dur="5.16">a third example is the armed arms races</text><text start="245.519" dur="4.14">let&apos;s say there&apos;s a new technology for a</text><text start="247.44" dur="3.78">weapon I can be like yeah no I don&apos;t</text><text start="249.659" dur="3.601">want to do that because that&apos;s just too</text><text start="251.22" dur="4.079">dangerous maybe like AI drones or</text><text start="253.26" dur="4.8">something but if I don&apos;t do it my</text><text start="255.299" dur="5.761">another country does next War I simply</text><text start="258.06" dur="4.32">lose it&apos;s over so multi-polar traps is</text><text start="261.06" dur="3.12">something where it&apos;s not evil</text><text start="262.38" dur="4.14">individuals that take evil decisions</text><text start="264.18" dur="5.16">it&apos;s just something where I don&apos;t do it</text><text start="266.52" dur="5.459">then somebody else does it and then we</text><text start="269.34" dur="6.0">both lose anyways so it is having to</text><text start="271.979" dur="4.921">abuse as perverse incentive</text><text start="275.34" dur="3.66">um and not really having an option of</text><text start="276.9" dur="3.299">not doing it so multi-polar traps are</text><text start="279.0" dur="3.36">really at the core of many of the</text><text start="280.199" dur="5.581">problems we have and it&apos;s one of the</text><text start="282.36" dur="5.16">ways of of explaining these sometimes at</text><text start="285.78" dur="3.3">least controversial decisions with</text><text start="287.52" dur="3.6">something that&apos;s not just hey they are</text><text start="289.08" dur="4.44">evil it&apos;s something it&apos;s part of the</text><text start="291.12" dur="3.96">underlying problem another important</text><text start="293.52" dur="3.6">framework are the types of structure</text><text start="295.08" dur="4.26">used in a society so on one hand we have</text><text start="297.12" dur="4.2">all the physical technical aspects so</text><text start="299.34" dur="3.84">that&apos;s our infrastructure all the</text><text start="301.32" dur="5.159">Technologies we use from water food</text><text start="303.18" dur="5.16">energy Supply Transportation Etc we also</text><text start="306.479" dur="3.601">have the social structure so those are</text><text start="308.34" dur="4.38">our coordination protocols our</text><text start="310.08" dur="4.38">institutions our institutions and our</text><text start="312.72" dur="4.68">government body and we have the</text><text start="314.46" dur="5.64">superstructure so the our shared values</text><text start="317.4" dur="4.92">our culture our spirituality</text><text start="320.1" dur="3.599">um some more on a psychological level</text><text start="322.32" dur="3.719">than on a physical</text><text start="323.699" dur="4.621">all of these are inter-affecting each</text><text start="326.039" dur="4.741">other and as we&apos;ll hear later to to</text><text start="328.32" dur="4.86">create any new type of of civilization</text><text start="330.78" dur="4.919">structure all three of these have are</text><text start="333.18" dur="4.5">going to have to be affected so let&apos;s</text><text start="335.699" dur="4.741">talk about the catastrophic risks for a</text><text start="337.68" dur="4.68">second so what catastrophic risks that</text><text start="340.44" dur="4.259">are really catastrophic to all of</text><text start="342.36" dur="4.74">civilization are there well first of all</text><text start="344.699" dur="5.521">obviously nuclear war so if we have a</text><text start="347.1" dur="6.599">nuclear war happening there&apos;s not much</text><text start="350.22" dur="5.58">uh further life to be expected we have</text><text start="353.699" dur="4.741">all the climate change and environmental</text><text start="355.8" dur="4.92">issues is it topsoil depletion ocean</text><text start="358.44" dur="5.88">that zones pollinators biodiversity</text><text start="360.72" dur="6.12">species Extinction there might be some</text><text start="364.32" dur="4.92">debate as to how critical the climate</text><text start="366.84" dur="4.32">change as such actually is</text><text start="369.24" dur="3.84">um but there&apos;s not a debate that we have</text><text start="371.16" dur="2.819">some some problem in our environment for</text><text start="373.08" dur="3.3">sure</text><text start="373.979" dur="5.881">another key aspect are the fields of an</text><text start="376.38" dur="5.759">exponential Tech we have ai which we&apos;re</text><text start="379.86" dur="4.14">now seeing with chat GPT</text><text start="382.139" dur="4.261">um just how much influence that might be</text><text start="384.0" dur="4.56">having in social media uh sooner or</text><text start="386.4" dur="4.139">later where you can&apos;t really say what is</text><text start="388.56" dur="5.759">real what is not and what somebody just</text><text start="390.539" dur="6.66">created with an AI we have all the the</text><text start="394.319" dur="5.281">Weaponry aspects of AI so a drone with</text><text start="397.199" dur="5.461">with the eye it&apos;s just a whole new level</text><text start="399.6" dur="5.46">of warfare but we also have biotech and</text><text start="402.66" dur="4.259">nanotech um already mentioned drone and</text><text start="405.06" dur="4.8">cyber warfare so there&apos;s just a lot of</text><text start="406.919" dur="5.22">we have a lot more power in with tech</text><text start="409.86" dur="4.92">not with technology and there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="412.139" dur="4.56">more risks associated with it we also</text><text start="414.78" dur="3.66">have the simple intersection of economic</text><text start="416.699" dur="3.78">of an economic system requiring</text><text start="418.44" dur="4.5">exponential growth with a planet</text><text start="420.479" dur="5.28">reaching planetary boundaries so our</text><text start="422.94" dur="5.039">whole system is is based on exponential</text><text start="425.759" dur="4.621">growth of our economic system but our</text><text start="427.979" dur="4.5">planet is is not infinite so we can&apos;t</text><text start="430.38" dur="3.78">just grow in uh exponentially forever</text><text start="432.479" dur="4.021">we&apos;re going to reach some some</text><text start="434.16" dur="4.68">boundaries so let&apos;s talk about the meta</text><text start="436.5" dur="4.259">crisis what is the meta crisis it&apos;s the</text><text start="438.84" dur="4.5">connectedness of all the before</text><text start="440.759" dur="4.38">mentioned catastrophic risks so it&apos;s not</text><text start="443.34" dur="4.259">that we&apos;re having one issue and one</text><text start="445.139" dur="5.821">crisis in one part of the world we have</text><text start="447.599" dur="5.1">all of these crises to crises I don&apos;t</text><text start="450.96" dur="3.6">know but the plural is of that together</text><text start="452.699" dur="3.12">and</text><text start="454.56" dur="2.94">um they&apos;re connected with each other</text><text start="455.819" dur="3.361">that&apos;s the problem it&apos;s not just their</text><text start="457.5" dur="3.44">with this one little problem here and</text><text start="459.18" dur="4.26">there&apos;s one little problem there no it&apos;s</text><text start="460.94" dur="6.34">underlying problems that create all of</text><text start="463.44" dur="6.06">these crisis uh yeah afterwards</text><text start="467.28" dur="4.5">so what are the underlying issues it&apos;s</text><text start="469.5" dur="4.259">exponential technology we have so much</text><text start="471.78" dur="3.419">more power than we used to and it&apos;s</text><text start="473.759" dur="3.901">really come to a point where we can</text><text start="475.199" dur="4.861">actually destroy our whole civilization</text><text start="477.66" dur="4.68">um with it our problem solving as such</text><text start="480.06" dur="4.74">so the way we we actually go about</text><text start="482.34" dur="5.1">problem solving in our governments is</text><text start="484.8" dur="6.119">just mostly completely wrong we don&apos;t</text><text start="487.44" dur="5.819">have well thought out solutions to to</text><text start="490.919" dur="3.961">groups of problems we just have two</text><text start="493.259" dur="3.121">participants that are screaming at each</text><text start="494.88" dur="3.0">other and we have to vote for one of</text><text start="496.38" dur="3.78">those that&apos;s not how it&apos;s supposed to be</text><text start="497.88" dur="3.719">and our group and our sessions are</text><text start="500.16" dur="3.0">actually one of the aspects trying to</text><text start="501.599" dur="3.361">make better problem solving with</text><text start="503.16" dur="3.9">collective intelligence</text><text start="504.96" dur="4.62">we have unprecedented times due to</text><text start="507.06" dur="4.919">globalization so many civilizations have</text><text start="509.58" dur="3.48">ended or collapsed in in the history of</text><text start="511.979" dur="3.541">humanity</text><text start="513.06" dur="4.44">however we&apos;ve never had one Global</text><text start="515.52" dur="4.8">civilization that it was completely</text><text start="517.5" dur="5.159">interconnected so if this one fails</text><text start="520.32" dur="5.579">that&apos;s kind of it it&apos;s it&apos;s over our</text><text start="522.659" dur="5.161">whole civilization just collapses</text><text start="525.899" dur="3.481">we have the kind of related to the</text><text start="527.82" dur="3.72">exponential technology we have the power</text><text start="529.38" dur="3.84">of gods without the wisdom of God so we</text><text start="531.54" dur="3.96">actually have the power to destroy the</text><text start="533.22" dur="4.38">whole planet but have we gotten that</text><text start="535.5" dur="4.56">much wiser to actually be able to use</text><text start="537.6" dur="5.4">that kind of power schmuckenberger</text><text start="540.06" dur="5.58">argues not and I guess I would agree we</text><text start="543.0" dur="5.279">don&apos;t our our sins making and our wisdom</text><text start="545.64" dur="5.54">has not even closely developed as fast</text><text start="548.279" dur="7.081">as technology has and now we have</text><text start="551.18" dur="6.42">literal Apes uh with the with nuclear</text><text start="555.36" dur="5.099">bombs so yeah just think about that</text><text start="557.6" dur="4.72">multiple traps we we talked about before</text><text start="560.459" dur="5.281">those are also one of the underlying</text><text start="562.32" dur="5.34">issues um why we have this this meta</text><text start="565.74" dur="4.32">crisis</text><text start="567.66" dur="4.679">so the whole series is called in search</text><text start="570.06" dur="3.719">of the third attractor why in search of</text><text start="572.339" dur="3.361">the third attractor well first of all</text><text start="573.779" dur="3.901">because we have two current attractors</text><text start="575.7" dur="4.62">that we don&apos;t really know where we&apos;re</text><text start="577.68" dur="4.2">going but neither of them are great and</text><text start="580.32" dur="4.26">we don&apos;t really have what the the third</text><text start="581.88" dur="4.86">attractor will be so let&apos;s look first at</text><text start="584.58" dur="4.08">what are the two current attractors one</text><text start="586.74" dur="4.56">of them is catastrophe</text><text start="588.66" dur="5.22">if we keep doing uh kind of the</text><text start="591.3" dur="3.78">decentralized slow Choice making so with</text><text start="593.88" dur="3.6">our</text><text start="595.08" dur="5.4">um not ideal government bodies with the</text><text start="597.48" dur="5.7">the type of democracy we have right now</text><text start="600.48" dur="5.58">um it&apos;s kind of decentralized but it&apos;s</text><text start="603.18" dur="4.8">very slow and there&apos;s just we&apos;re not</text><text start="606.06" dur="5.219">even close to having all the decisions</text><text start="607.98" dur="5.7">to to get out of all the crises we&apos;re in</text><text start="611.279" dur="4.921">and with exponential technology we have</text><text start="613.68" dur="5.52">a lot of destructive power in a lot of</text><text start="616.2" dur="5.88">different hands so we used to have the</text><text start="619.2" dur="6.48">mutual assorted destruction between the</text><text start="622.08" dur="5.22">the Soviet Union and the USA and either</text><text start="625.68" dur="3.36">one of them knew that if the other</text><text start="627.3" dur="4.979">presses the button it&apos;s game over for</text><text start="629.04" dur="5.64">both of us so we just don&apos;t do that now</text><text start="632.279" dur="4.68">this this destructive power has been</text><text start="634.68" dur="3.3">decentralized a lot more than it used to</text><text start="636.959" dur="3.181">be</text><text start="637.98" dur="4.44">so now we don&apos;t just have mutually</text><text start="640.14" dur="5.28">assured destruction but we have so many</text><text start="642.42" dur="5.34">Powers with not just nuclear bombs but</text><text start="645.42" dur="5.159">with very destructive powers that this</text><text start="647.76" dur="5.639">is just not a an opportunity anymore so</text><text start="650.579" dur="4.621">this doesn&apos;t doesn&apos;t work anymore and</text><text start="653.399" dur="5.581">will lead sooner or later to catastrophe</text><text start="655.2" dur="5.759">the other attractor is dystopia so if</text><text start="658.98" dur="3.599">you do it like China for example with</text><text start="660.959" dur="3.901">their centralized fast Choice making</text><text start="662.579" dur="5.101">it&apos;s basically one person taking all the</text><text start="664.86" dur="4.62">decisions which has its advantages</text><text start="667.68" dur="4.62">because you&apos;re actually a lot faster</text><text start="669.48" dur="6.18">with this this Choice making and I mean</text><text start="672.3" dur="5.34">if you look at topics like education or</text><text start="675.66" dur="4.32">I guess economics as well even though I</text><text start="677.64" dur="4.439">don&apos;t know enough about that in China it</text><text start="679.98" dur="4.919">partly they&apos;re doing very well and</text><text start="682.079" dur="4.561">they&apos;re kind of even Tick Tock just how</text><text start="684.899" dur="4.201">Tick Tock is used in China compared to</text><text start="686.64" dur="4.74">how it&apos;s used in in other countries they</text><text start="689.1" dur="4.5">actually use it to to show engineering</text><text start="691.38" dur="4.019">projects and how to to be a better</text><text start="693.6" dur="3.66">person Etc</text><text start="695.399" dur="3.901">but this all comes at the cost of no</text><text start="697.26" dur="4.139">individual Freedom so if you actually</text><text start="699.3" dur="4.62">centralize all the power maybe even</text><text start="701.399" dur="4.801">globally to the wef or wherever you</text><text start="703.92" dur="4.32">wanna wherever you want to do that</text><text start="706.2" dur="5.28">um that the individuals around the world</text><text start="708.24" dur="5.76">will suffer do you basically just some</text><text start="711.48" dur="4.44">entity controlling whatever happens and</text><text start="714.0" dur="4.32">in order to be able to do that the</text><text start="715.92" dur="3.659">individuals can&apos;t have any power So</text><text start="718.32" dur="3.42">currently we&apos;re either going to</text><text start="719.579" dur="5.101">catastrophe or we&apos;re going to dystopia</text><text start="721.74" dur="4.44">either we just keep letting all the</text><text start="724.68" dur="3.659">problems simmer and we can&apos;t really do</text><text start="726.18" dur="3.839">anything about it and sooner or later</text><text start="728.339" dur="3.721">something&apos;s going to blow up and we&apos;re</text><text start="730.019" dur="4.021">all going to blow up or we&apos;re going to a</text><text start="732.06" dur="4.5">dystopian Direction where somebody takes</text><text start="734.04" dur="4.32">all the power necessary to actually be</text><text start="736.56" dur="3.959">able to make all of these decisions that</text><text start="738.36" dur="4.08">are necessary but we lost all of our</text><text start="740.519" dur="4.701">freedom in the process</text><text start="742.44" dur="5.519">so what is the third attractor</text><text start="745.22" dur="4.359">the quick question the quick answer to</text><text start="747.959" dur="3.06">that question is we don&apos;t know Daniel</text><text start="749.579" dur="3.661">schmuckenberger does not have the</text><text start="751.019" dur="4.801">solution what the third attractor is but</text><text start="753.24" dur="5.159">he has some criteria on what he would be</text><text start="755.82" dur="4.44">able to to entail so one of them it&apos;s</text><text start="758.399" dur="5.461">able to prevent all human-induced</text><text start="760.26" dur="6.0">catastrophes so in order to be a legit</text><text start="763.86" dur="5.4">third attractor we can&apos;t blow ourselves</text><text start="766.26" dur="5.699">up so that would be one of the criteria</text><text start="769.26" dur="4.8">it would also require a coherent Choice</text><text start="771.959" dur="3.541">making factoring the total collective</text><text start="774.06" dur="3.66">intelligence with the speed and</text><text start="775.5" dur="3.0">coherence a small number of Agents would</text><text start="777.72" dur="4.32">have</text><text start="778.5" dur="6.06">so in it&apos;s quite the sentence in in</text><text start="782.04" dur="5.22">general the more people you try to to</text><text start="784.56" dur="5.279">have making a choice the the slower it</text><text start="787.26" dur="4.259">is the less people so just a small</text><text start="789.839" dur="4.56">number of Agents would have the faster</text><text start="791.519" dur="6.0">it is but we want the intelligence of</text><text start="794.399" dur="6.901">the collective and and the with the</text><text start="797.519" dur="7.861">speed of of individuals so some type of</text><text start="801.3" dur="7.02">of AI supported decision-making process</text><text start="805.38" dur="4.98">not that the AI takes the decision but</text><text start="808.32" dur="4.8">that It prepares kind of the</text><text start="810.36" dur="5.279">problem-solving process as such</text><text start="813.12" dur="6.12">um without any having having this type</text><text start="815.639" dur="6.661">of fast decision making without any uh</text><text start="819.24" dur="4.92">centralized power that would be one of</text><text start="822.3" dur="3.9">the the criteria as well and that is the</text><text start="824.16" dur="5.4">things one of the aspects of what we are</text><text start="826.2" dur="5.16">working on to really improve the</text><text start="829.56" dur="3.959">processes of collective intelligence and</text><text start="831.36" dur="4.26">Collective sense making</text><text start="833.519" dur="4.981">um yes harmonizing the ability to hyper</text><text start="835.62" dur="5.339">agency while focusing on Collective</text><text start="838.5" dur="4.26">well-being so it&apos;s not me versus you and</text><text start="840.959" dur="4.56">I have to take some some perverse</text><text start="842.76" dur="5.46">incentive in order to to be even able to</text><text start="845.519" dur="5.041">sustain my hyper agency but I can</text><text start="848.22" dur="4.619">sustain my hyper agency while also</text><text start="850.56" dur="3.48">really being able to focus on Collective</text><text start="852.839" dur="4.081">well-being</text><text start="854.04" dur="4.5">and the the fourth one the fourth</text><text start="856.92" dur="3.599">criteria it has to be on all three</text><text start="858.54" dur="3.9">levels as we said before infrastructure</text><text start="860.519" dur="5.041">social social structure and</text><text start="862.44" dur="4.86">superstructure so not a small task but</text><text start="865.56" dur="3.719">at least gives us some criteria of how</text><text start="867.3" dur="3.719">to look at it he also gives us a couple</text><text start="869.279" dur="3.601">of potential tools</text><text start="871.019" dur="4.141">in the end it is all systems of</text><text start="872.88" dur="4.68">collective intelligence and education we</text><text start="875.16" dur="4.26">have to use our collective intelligence</text><text start="877.56" dur="3.12">which we&apos;re able to do now with the</text><text start="879.42" dur="3.659">internet</text><text start="880.68" dur="5.519">um and use it for for just better sense</text><text start="883.079" dur="5.101">making and and also education so</text><text start="886.199" dur="3.541">education is one of the aspects he</text><text start="888.18" dur="3.899">focuses on the more people know the</text><text start="889.74" dur="4.68">better the collective sense making so</text><text start="892.079" dur="4.38">using technology it could be AI</text><text start="894.42" dur="4.5">delivering some mentoring from anybody</text><text start="896.459" dur="5.521">in the world from any time so imagine</text><text start="898.92" dur="5.46">just asking Albert Einstein about the</text><text start="901.98" dur="6.18">basics of physics or whatever this will</text><text start="904.38" dur="6.0">be possible in not too much time so AI</text><text start="908.16" dur="6.419">is really could be one of the next steps</text><text start="910.38" dur="6.66">for for an insane level of Education</text><text start="914.579" dur="5.101">but also collective intelligence we need</text><text start="917.04" dur="4.68">to have new ways of problem solving</text><text start="919.68" dur="4.2">um and AI could also be a focus on</text><text start="921.72" dur="5.1">facilitating that how do we approach</text><text start="923.88" dur="5.34">each other what are the the real issues</text><text start="926.82" dur="5.34">of the meta crisis and what can we do to</text><text start="929.22" dur="4.979">to solve them so that is it that&apos;s just</text><text start="932.16" dur="4.26">a short overview on what the third</text><text start="934.199" dur="4.08">attractor framework from schmuckenberger</text><text start="936.42" dur="3.539">looks like we&apos;ll keep talking about it</text><text start="938.279" dur="3.0">in our discussions but now you have a</text><text start="939.959" dur="4.341">basic understanding of what it&apos;s all</text><text start="941.279" dur="3.021">about thank you</text></transcript>
