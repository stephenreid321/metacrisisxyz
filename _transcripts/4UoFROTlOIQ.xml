right</text><text start="20.22" dur="4.2">um wow I am super super stoked about</text><text start="22.98" dur="4.139">this episode of the planetary</text><text start="24.42" dur="5.4">regeneration podcast I have my friends</text><text start="27.119" dur="6.321">Daniel schmachtenberger and Jason Snyder</text><text start="29.82" dur="7.94">to dig into a conversation about</text><text start="33.44" dur="6.6">the edges and potential of localism</text><text start="37.76" dur="4.979">global coordination</text><text start="40.04" dur="5.5">failures challenges and opportunities</text><text start="42.739" dur="5.5">and super grateful for both of your time</text><text start="45.54" dur="5.4">uh this this afternoon this evening and</text><text start="48.239" dur="4.381">yeah just stoked to dive in maybe I&apos;ll</text><text start="50.94" dur="3.779">I&apos;ll just do a quick introduction for</text><text start="52.62" dur="4.38">each of you I I&apos;m pretty sure that most</text><text start="54.719" dur="4.32">guests listeners that is know both of</text><text start="57.0" dur="4.92">you but um I&apos;ll start with Daniel So</text><text start="59.039" dur="5.281">Daniel schmachtenberger is</text><text start="61.92" dur="4.739">um I think really one of the more</text><text start="64.32" dur="5.52">rigorous and interesting thinkers</text><text start="66.659" dur="5.64">amongst a particular emerging field of</text><text start="69.84" dur="4.8">thought that is exploring</text><text start="72.299" dur="4.741">um I don&apos;t know I&apos;ve heard this sort of</text><text start="74.64" dur="4.86">broadly this loose Confederation of</text><text start="77.04" dur="5.34">people referred to as game B a little</text><text start="79.5" dur="4.619">bit although in some ways Daniel I don&apos;t</text><text start="82.38" dur="3.9">totally you know put you in that</text><text start="84.119" dur="4.201">category but at least game be adjacent</text><text start="86.28" dur="4.14">and provocative and and sort of like</text><text start="88.32" dur="5.299">leading a lot of those conversations and</text><text start="90.42" dur="5.46">uh Jason you&apos;re one of the um</text><text start="93.619" dur="5.801">co-conveners and co-creators of the</text><text start="95.88" dur="6.0">Doomer optimism movement and podcast and</text><text start="99.42" dur="4.5">um I think this is sort of a meeting of</text><text start="101.88" dur="4.86">different but similar ways of thinking</text><text start="103.92" dur="5.22">about the meta crisis and maybe in some</text><text start="106.74" dur="5.4">way the meta opportunity or potential</text><text start="109.14" dur="5.4">for we humans and how to inhabit the</text><text start="112.14" dur="4.5">Earth in a better way so um with that</text><text start="114.54" dur="4.5">I&apos;d love it maybe pass it over to you</text><text start="116.64" dur="4.14">Daniel just to say hello and maybe you</text><text start="119.04" dur="4.259">know anything you want to just you know</text><text start="120.78" dur="4.619">frame out or say hello to the audience</text><text start="123.299" dur="3.721">and then Jason get your voice in there</text><text start="125.399" dur="4.621">and then I think after we do a quick</text><text start="127.02" dur="5.82">round let&apos;s jump into the the meat of</text><text start="130.02" dur="4.799">the conversation here together I&apos;ll let</text><text start="132.84" dur="3.66">you take it from here Daniel well thank</text><text start="134.819" dur="3.721">you for having me it&apos;s really good to be</text><text start="136.5" dur="4.2">here Gregory remember you and I were</text><text start="138.54" dur="4.199">talking about this when we met at a</text><text start="140.7" dur="3.96">conference uh some number of months ago</text><text start="142.739" dur="4.921">and we&apos;re talking about potential</text><text start="144.66" dur="4.32">downsides to uh exclusively localist</text><text start="147.66" dur="3.36">focus and so I look forward to getting</text><text start="148.98" dur="5.04">into that content but I have always</text><text start="151.02" dur="5.1">appreciated your work that is looking at</text><text start="154.02" dur="5.1">how to have Tech and service of nature</text><text start="156.12" dur="5.339">rather than the idea that a high nature</text><text start="159.12" dur="5.04">World means a low-tech world or a</text><text start="161.459" dur="5.521">high-tech world is uh exploitative of</text><text start="164.16" dur="5.46">nature because if some subset of</text><text start="166.98" dur="4.259">population tries a lower Tech world and</text><text start="169.62" dur="3.899">the other doesn&apos;t so one&apos;s trying to</text><text start="171.239" dur="4.201">lower Tech World simply can&apos;t influence</text><text start="173.519" dur="3.541">the ones that have a higher Tech world</text><text start="175.44" dur="3.54">all that much because the tech ends up</text><text start="177.06" dur="4.74">equaling power so how do we get to Tech</text><text start="178.98" dur="4.74">in service of ecology and foundational</text><text start="181.8" dur="5.579">Humanity I think is critically important</text><text start="183.72" dur="7.08">in the regenerative focus and um I am</text><text start="187.379" dur="7.021">just meeting Jason but um you know since</text><text start="190.8" dur="6.719">I work on catastrophic risk the the</text><text start="194.4" dur="5.16">Doomer optimism theme is good because we</text><text start="197.519" dur="5.101">kind of our approach to to take all of</text><text start="199.56" dur="4.8">the catastrophic risks collectively as</text><text start="202.62" dur="3.6">the design constraints for what Humanity</text><text start="204.36" dur="3.959">has to coordinate to make it through and</text><text start="206.22" dur="3.659">to look at only those models of</text><text start="208.319" dur="3.78">civilization and make it through all the</text><text start="209.879" dur="4.621">catastrophic risks is viable which is</text><text start="212.099" dur="4.981">definitely taking a well-informed by the</text><text start="214.5" dur="4.56">Doom approach and then looking at how to</text><text start="217.08" dur="3.18">thread that needle as The Optimist</text><text start="219.06" dur="3.599">approach or what we kind of call</text><text start="220.26" dur="4.14">post-cynical optimism sometimes so</text><text start="222.659" dur="4.561">looking forward to seeing where we go</text><text start="224.4" dur="4.86">great well hello pleasure to be here</text><text start="227.22" dur="4.079">I&apos;ve known Gregory for a little while</text><text start="229.26" dur="5.039">and I&apos;d like to say that we&apos;re friends</text><text start="231.299" dur="6.061">and sometimes we argue about things but</text><text start="234.299" dur="5.461">that&apos;s good and Daniel I&apos;ve followed</text><text start="237.36" dur="6.78">your work on podcasts for a few years</text><text start="239.76" dur="6.539">and I feel like it&apos;s been very useful</text><text start="244.14" dur="4.5">for me to help frame my thinking so it&apos;s</text><text start="246.299" dur="5.16">an honor to be in conversation with both</text><text start="248.64" dur="5.58">of you I guess here I&apos;m representing uh</text><text start="251.459" dur="5.28">the Doomer optimism podcast in world</text><text start="254.22" dur="4.139">even if it&apos;s not a monolithic things I</text><text start="256.739" dur="4.081">don&apos;t know to the degree that I can</text><text start="258.359" dur="4.981">represent it happy to be here</text><text start="260.82" dur="4.319">yeah and thanks for being here Jason and</text><text start="263.34" dur="4.02">and I forgot to mention I think we&apos;re</text><text start="265.139" dur="4.141">going to be co-releasing this uh on the</text><text start="267.36" dur="4.26">Doomer optimism feed and the planetary</text><text start="269.28" dur="4.56">regeneration feed and uh so I&apos;m pretty</text><text start="271.62" dur="4.44">excited about that cross-pollination so</text><text start="273.84" dur="5.639">you know just to start out Daniel I I</text><text start="276.06" dur="4.52">love the framing of High-Tech high</text><text start="279.479" dur="4.741">nature</text><text start="280.58" dur="6.42">low-tech High nature low nature</text><text start="284.22" dur="5.58">high-tech</text><text start="287.0" dur="4.479">this this sort of quadrant framework</text><text start="289.8" dur="3.899">probably you could sort of think of it</text><text start="291.479" dur="4.641">with um you know Tech and nature on</text><text start="293.699" dur="5.94">opposing sites and like what happens</text><text start="296.12" dur="5.74">when you&apos;re strategically oriented in</text><text start="299.639" dur="5.821">those different ways so do you want to</text><text start="301.86" dur="6.08">just um take a brief moment to expand on</text><text start="305.46" dur="5.1">that as a framework for thinking about</text><text start="307.94" dur="4.6">strategies in the 21st century for</text><text start="310.56" dur="4.56">people who are kind of bumping up</text><text start="312.54" dur="5.159">against the meta crisis the meaning</text><text start="315.12" dur="5.12">crisis and thinking about vocations and</text><text start="317.699" dur="5.581">lifeways and what the hell do we all do</text><text start="320.24" dur="4.959">as individuals or as communities</text><text start="323.28" dur="3.84">yeah sure</text><text start="325.199" dur="3.661">um I think if you put it on a two by two</text><text start="327.12" dur="4.799">grid like that high and low nature high</text><text start="328.86" dur="5.82">and low Tech from where we are and with</text><text start="331.919" dur="4.5">the implicit coordination dynamics that</text><text start="334.68" dur="3.9">have to be dealt with I think what you</text><text start="336.419" dur="5.521">framed it the high technology high</text><text start="338.58" dur="6.0">nature and more specifically technology</text><text start="341.94" dur="4.44">in service of the radiation of Nature</text><text start="344.58" dur="5.339">and our ability to continue to engage</text><text start="346.38" dur="7.8">with it uh to be part of it is the only</text><text start="349.919" dur="6.481">quadrant that can forward the low nature</text><text start="354.18" dur="6.12">high-tech is the one we&apos;re on right we</text><text start="356.4" dur="6.06">just use our technology to Nature into</text><text start="360.3" dur="5.58">trash faster than either side of that</text><text start="362.46" dur="7.019">open loop Health drives from pollution</text><text start="365.88" dur="5.94">and if you think about humans are rising</text><text start="369.479" dur="4.5">out of nature building Tech using the</text><text start="371.82" dur="3.599">tech to compete with other humans to</text><text start="373.979" dur="3.361">convert nature into Commodities</text><text start="375.419" dur="4.921">pollution and waste faster</text><text start="377.34" dur="5.88">that is obviously us using our</text><text start="380.34" dur="4.62">exponentially increasing capability to</text><text start="383.22" dur="4.5">destroy the substrate that we depend</text><text start="384.96" dur="4.2">upon I&apos;m not thinking of nature as a</text><text start="387.72" dur="3.0">substrate as a good way of thinking</text><text start="389.16" dur="4.979">about it because it leads to this kind</text><text start="390.72" dur="6.72">of extract way of being people thinking</text><text start="394.139" dur="5.221">about nature as intrinsically meaningful</text><text start="397.44" dur="4.68">beautiful sacred and that our life</text><text start="399.36" dur="4.8">should be in relationship to and in</text><text start="402.12" dur="4.919">service to it is much better but even</text><text start="404.16" dur="6.0">from just a kind of human utilitarian</text><text start="407.039" dur="5.581">view insofar as we emerge out of and it</text><text start="410.16" dur="4.08">is our substrate any system that debases</text><text start="412.62" dur="3.9">the substrate it depends on is in the</text><text start="414.24" dur="5.579">process of self-terminating so the</text><text start="416.52" dur="5.459">increasing Tech that way right a linear</text><text start="419.819" dur="4.621">materials economy that is looking at</text><text start="421.979" dur="5.521">nature as natural resources to be</text><text start="424.44" dur="4.62">extracted and the other side of that</text><text start="427.5" dur="4.8">after they&apos;re used for a short period of</text><text start="429.06" dur="4.74">time is uh pollution and waste and we&apos;re</text><text start="432.3" dur="3.48">extracting them faster than they can</text><text start="433.8" dur="3.179">replenish so we get depletion and all</text><text start="435.78" dur="3.479">the planetary boundaries on the</text><text start="436.979" dur="6.301">depletion inside loss of species loss of</text><text start="439.259" dur="6.481">soil loss of hydrocarbons phosphorus</text><text start="443.28" dur="4.56">blah blah blah then turning them into</text><text start="445.74" dur="3.799">waste and pollution on the other side</text><text start="447.84" dur="4.259">faster than they can be processed</text><text start="449.539" dur="6.761">climate change chemical planetary</text><text start="452.099" dur="7.921">boundaries mining wastes Etc all the</text><text start="456.3" dur="6.06">planetary boundaries come from high tech</text><text start="460.02" dur="4.2">you know with our financial system</text><text start="462.36" dur="3.72">having embedded growth obligations and</text><text start="464.22" dur="4.319">linear materials economy being what</text><text start="466.08" dur="4.559">coordinates how that Tech works and so</text><text start="468.539" dur="4.38">to not cross all the planetary</text><text start="470.639" dur="4.141">boundaries we have to address that</text><text start="472.919" dur="3.961">if you tried to say well what about the</text><text start="474.78" dur="4.52">low Tech ones low-tech low nature is</text><text start="476.88" dur="4.62">like the image of some kind of</text><text start="479.3" dur="5.44">post-apocalyptic scorched Earth there&apos;s</text><text start="481.5" dur="7.259">a few humans left on a shitty biosphere</text><text start="484.74" dur="6.84">in a caveman-like life High nature</text><text start="488.759" dur="5.541">low-tech might seem like a nice option</text><text start="491.58" dur="8.58">except it&apos;s not inactible right this is</text><text start="494.3" dur="8.739">where we were historically but if unless</text><text start="500.16" dur="6.0">the entire world agrees to all decrease</text><text start="503.039" dur="4.921">its Tech then whoever doesn&apos;t whether</text><text start="506.16" dur="3.12">they have more military Tech or more</text><text start="507.96" dur="3.84">extraction Tech or whatever they&apos;re</text><text start="509.28" dur="4.139">going to grow their populations faster</text><text start="511.8" dur="3.96">when in warfareers have more</text><text start="513.419" dur="3.3">geopolitical influence all those other</text><text start="515.76" dur="4.219">things</text><text start="516.719" dur="5.341">and so because whoever is</text><text start="519.979" dur="3.461">seeking to do something that is in</text><text start="522.06" dur="3.36">service to Nature that doesn&apos;t cross</text><text start="523.44" dur="3.72">planetary boundaries has to influence</text><text start="525.42" dur="5.16">everyone else because it&apos;s not like</text><text start="527.16" dur="5.22">people in some area can solve the</text><text start="530.58" dur="3.24">planetary boundary by themselves and yet</text><text start="532.38" dur="4.74">they&apos;re all affected by the planetary</text><text start="533.82" dur="5.34">boundary if if we want to avoid breaking</text><text start="537.12" dur="3.48">the hydrological pump of the Amazon or</text><text start="539.16" dur="4.02">having fluorinated surfactants</text><text start="540.6" dur="5.58">everywhere kill everything or species</text><text start="543.18" dur="5.219">Extinction we have to change what China</text><text start="546.18" dur="4.8">does and what India does and what Europe</text><text start="548.399" dur="4.741">does and what the US do which means</text><text start="550.98" dur="5.88">you&apos;ve got to have some modeled it</text><text start="553.14" dur="5.04">either that they&apos;re going to adopt and</text><text start="556.86" dur="4.8">which means that whatever you&apos;re doing</text><text start="558.18" dur="8.159">has to actually be in able to influence</text><text start="561.66" dur="6.299">and uh so realizing that there isn&apos;t a</text><text start="566.339" dur="4.44">king of everything that can say let&apos;s</text><text start="567.959" dur="4.981">degrowth and lower Tech then you don&apos;t</text><text start="570.779" dur="4.321">want some groups opting to do a thing</text><text start="572.94" dur="3.959">that isn&apos;t enough to change the</text><text start="575.1" dur="4.08">planetary reality and definitely can&apos;t</text><text start="576.899" dur="4.681">influence the rest of the scenario</text><text start="579.18" dur="5.099">so how do you use the top tools of</text><text start="581.58" dur="4.68">coordination and technology in a way</text><text start="584.279" dur="3.841">that regenerates rather than depletes</text><text start="586.26" dur="3.48">and that has the capacity to influence</text><text start="588.12" dur="5.0">the rest of the world to adopt them in</text><text start="589.74" dur="6.02">time seems to me the only way forward</text><text start="593.12" dur="7.24">uh word</text><text start="595.76" dur="6.28">that totally mimics my analysis and view</text><text start="600.36" dur="3.9">there&apos;s a whole bundle of questions</text><text start="602.04" dur="5.52">there that I&apos;m really excited to dig</text><text start="604.26" dur="6.06">into with both of you I think I kind of</text><text start="607.56" dur="6.3">want to weave your voice in here Jason</text><text start="610.32" dur="5.76">just you know what emerges for you when</text><text start="613.86" dur="4.26">you hear this sort of you know kind of I</text><text start="616.08" dur="5.64">think Daniel&apos;s staking out a pretty</text><text start="618.12" dur="6.06">clear perspective which I basically</text><text start="621.72" dur="5.78">agree with that you know if you think</text><text start="624.18" dur="6.24">about this hard you you sort of</text><text start="627.5" dur="6.16">realistically we have to be acting in</text><text start="630.42" dur="5.4">the high tech High nature quadrant I</text><text start="633.66" dur="5.52">think you know I like that framing it</text><text start="635.82" dur="5.76">matches my logical perspective and I</text><text start="639.18" dur="3.96">know that if that&apos;s not going to match a</text><text start="641.58" dur="4.14">lot of people&apos;s perspective in the</text><text start="643.14" dur="6.24">Doomer optimism Community who are going</text><text start="645.72" dur="6.5">to be thinking maybe there are ways to</text><text start="649.38" dur="5.519">move forward with a low-tech high nature</text><text start="652.22" dur="4.9">existence or transformation so I&apos;m just</text><text start="654.899" dur="4.081">curious you know what are your thoughts</text><text start="657.12" dur="2.459">and questions</text><text start="658.98" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="659.579" dur="6.301">after listening to Daniel</text><text start="661.92" dur="6.419">yeah okay well I guess first I would</text><text start="665.88" dur="5.579">want to question what kind of high-tech</text><text start="668.339" dur="6.06">uh I think most of us enjoy the internet</text><text start="671.459" dur="4.681">and we&apos;re often reflective that we do</text><text start="674.399" dur="5.101">enjoy the internet</text><text start="676.14" dur="6.6">um and what it enables even though we&apos;re</text><text start="679.5" dur="5.64">kind of let I adjust adjacent uh and so</text><text start="682.74" dur="7.2">what does that mean uh I would also want</text><text start="685.14" dur="6.66">to kind of question you guys on</text><text start="689.94" dur="6.54">how you would have high tech without</text><text start="691.8" dur="7.92">sacrifice zones all of the mining of

a</text><text start="1536.6" dur="4.26">result have to figure out how to make</text><text start="1538.94" dur="3.599">things work with each other and I think</text><text start="1540.86" dur="4.62">one of the</text><text start="1542.539" dur="4.861">like there&apos;s not enough trust in this</text><text start="1545.48" dur="3.72">global system the global system is</text><text start="1547.4" dur="4.2">let&apos;s regress to something smaller than</text><text start="1549.2" dur="4.74">Global creates a kind of regressive</text><text start="1551.6" dur="4.26">nationalism and also a

our</text><text start="1586.94" dur="4.38">technology is big enough to affect the</text><text start="1589.279" dur="3.961">whole world that everybody has to be</text><text start="1591.32"

locally you get the</text><text start="1609.26" dur="4.98">benefits of less transportation and more</text><text start="1611.419" dur="5.161">freshness and Tighter closed loops and</text><text start="1614.24" dur="4.439">the ability to see externalities more as</text><text start="1616.58" dur="3.78">well as resilience but I also believe</text><text start="1618.679" dur="3.48">there&apos;s a lot of things that should not</text><text start="1620.36" dur="3.78">be local because they happen more</text><text start="1622.159" dur="3.661">efficiently with economies of scale and</text><text start="1624.14" dur="2.94">because the interconnectivity of each</text><text start="1625.82" dur="3.599">other is actually and the</text><text start="1627.08" dur="5.099">interdependence is really important so</text><text start="1629.419" dur="6.421">that&apos;s the things that have to be held</text><text start="1632.179" dur="6.36">in tension yeah fantastic thanks Daniel</text><text start="1635.84" dur="5.1">and I think this is very this is this is</text><text start="1638.539" dur="4.081">the rich part of the conversation and I</text><text start="1640.94" dur="5.099">I kind of wanted to weave in a little</text><text start="1642.62" dur="5.76">bit of my perspective here which is you</text><text start="1646.039" dur="6.301">know if we&apos;re framing this out I really</text><text start="1648.38" dur="6.0">appreciate the clarity of framing the</text><text start="1652.34" dur="5.3">way that you know however we talk about</text><text start="1654.38" dur="6.179">it the neoliberal global order in which</text><text start="1657.64" dur="4.539">globalized trade and a globalized</text><text start="1660.559" dur="4.801">financial system</text><text start="1662.179" dur="6.12">is the antidote to</text><text start="1665.36" dur="4.74">you know World War III and uh you know</text><text start="1668.299" dur="3.48">nuclear Armageddon and I think it&apos;s</text><text start="1670.1" dur="4.559">important to understand that that is</text><text start="1671.779" dur="4.561">actually the inspiration of the</text><text start="1674.659" dur="4.981">institutions that have set up the world</text><text start="1676.34" dur="6.66">that we now live in and it&apos;s super clear</text><text start="1679.64" dur="6.6">just you know okay and and that is it at</text><text start="1683.0" dur="5.4">the expense of Mother Earth of nature of</text><text start="1686.24" dur="6.78">of living systems I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="1688.4" dur="7.8">crystal clear analysis and really you</text><text start="1693.02" dur="5.46">know from that analysis my personal</text><text start="1696.2" dur="7.079">perspective is if you shift the</text><text start="1698.48" dur="7.62">financial system such that value becomes</text><text start="1703.279" dur="5.76">uh not just an ecological debit</text><text start="1706.1" dur="5.88">ecological credit balancing system but</text><text start="1709.039" dur="6.781">that we actually start to derive uh</text><text start="1711.98" dur="7.62">status wealth and acknowledge the the</text><text start="1715.82" dur="6.5">value of living systems of nature</text><text start="1719.6" dur="5.34">um both from a sacred and completely</text><text start="1722.32" dur="6.459">unquantifiable way and like a veneration</text><text start="1724.94" dur="6.479">way an ethical way a moral way an</text><text start="1728.779" dur="5.461">artistic way an aesthetic way as well as</text><text start="1731.419" dur="4.88">a Quantified way and and this is sort of</text><text start="1734.24" dur="6.12">like I have a lot of thinking about</text><text start="1736.299" dur="6.221">currencies and money as properly</text><text start="1740.36" dur="5.34">multivalent it should be a wave and a</text><text start="1742.52" dur="5.519">particle should be sacred and able to be</text><text start="1745.7" dur="3.479">used in transaction but that&apos;s a maybe a</text><text start="1748.039" dur="4.74">different conversation for a different</text><text start="1749.179" dur="6.24">day but if we close that Loop then what</text><text start="1752.779" dur="6.02">happens I believe what happens is the</text><text start="1755.419" dur="6.36">aesthetic values and the sort of like</text><text start="1758.799" dur="5.321">regenerative efficiency of local people</text><text start="1761.779" dur="5.88">taking action to care for local places</text><text start="1764.12" dur="5.52">and live good local lives that are</text><text start="1767.659" dur="3.661">tending those food forests and caring</text><text start="1769.64" dur="4.139">for those riparian buffers and</text><text start="1771.32" dur="6.12">stewarding those forests becomes</text><text start="1773.779" dur="6.241">financially advantaged without you know</text><text start="1777.44" dur="4.32">like place you know and we&apos;re using and</text><text start="1780.02" dur="4.32">leveraging Technology to achieve that</text><text start="1781.76" dur="4.86">and that&apos;s in my mind and this is very</text><text start="1784.34" dur="4.68">it&apos;s a pretty simple analysis in a lot</text><text start="1786.62" dur="3.84">of ways but in my mind that&apos;s the you</text><text start="1789.02" dur="3.56">know that&apos;s the direction that&apos;s the</text><text start="1790.46" dur="5.16">sort of regen Direction which is to say</text><text start="1792.58" dur="5.44">that&apos;s the next step in the evolution of</text><text start="1795.62" dur="5.64">of global institutions is to transform</text><text start="1798.02" dur="5.58">our financial system to place the the</text><text

the center of how we</text><text start="1809.779" dur="6.78">measure Financial wealth yeah I think</text><text start="1813.26" dur="5.76">saying we want our currencies to be</text><text start="1816.559" dur="4.98">multivalent and to be particle and wave</text><text start="1819.02" dur="5.639">and to hold</text><text start="1821.539" dur="7.981">um nature in a sacred and artistic way</text><text start="1824.659" dur="8.101">but also a Quantified way I think at</text><text start="1829.52" dur="5.22">first blush that sounds right</text><text start="1832.76" dur="4.68">and of course the devil is in the</text><text start="1834.74" dur="5.34">details on it right so the</text><text start="1837.44" dur="6.18">quantification and then the</text><text start="1840.08" dur="6.54">commensuration of Quantified things is</text><text start="1843.62" dur="6.48">pretty deep to the game theoretic</text><text start="1846.62" dur="5.0">Challenge and all of the um in Tropic</text><text start="1850.1" dur="4.079">process we have</text><text start="1851.62" dur="5.74">so when we talk about the transformation</text><text start="1854.179" dur="5.761">of what has to be in terms of like our</text><text start="1857.36" dur="4.98">financial system there are some things</text><text start="1859.94" dur="5.099">there&apos;s a lot of things to talk about</text><text start="1862.34" dur="4.5">uh removing the growth obligation to</text><text start="1865.039" dur="3.661">have to keep up with just compounding</text><text start="1866.84" dur="5.219">interest let alone all the other things</text><text start="1868.7" dur="5.579">to force exponential growth of Energy</text><text start="1872.059" dur="4.441">Services obviously we have to do that</text><text

humongous because we don&apos;t know</text><text start="1881.659" dur="3.601">how to make a Global Financial system</text><text start="1883.46" dur="3.9">and not world war three any other way so</text><text start="1885.26" dur="4.799">that&apos;s a that&apos;s a big</text><text start="1887.36" dur="4.38">property rights is a huge thing who what</text><text start="1890.059" dur="5.761">does it mean to own the property who</text><text start="1891.74" dur="6.84">owns what property given that if my</text><text start="1895.82" dur="4.68">access to a resource comes from owning</text><text

dur="5.58">other Commodities or whatever it is</text><text start="1961.899" dur="5.681">pretty soon it&apos;s clear that if I cut</text><text start="1965.72" dur="3.959">down trees faster than I need them and</text><text start="1967.58" dur="4.44">have stores of Timber both because of</text><text start="1969.679" dur="4.261">economies of scale and ease of shipping</text><text start="1972.02"

dur="5.421">need what are the tools we need for this</text><text start="2385.359" dur="5.941">decision to be made over and over again</text><text start="2388.26" dur="6.4">but in like a local context

from sort of</text><text start="2470.5" dur="5.88">first principles you know I think you</text><text start="2473.5" dur="4.859">need to have you know these essentially</text><text start="2476.38"

at an</text><text start="3171.3" dur="3.84">atomic level and we have to factor the</text><text start="3173.339" dur="3.601">breakdown of those systems how do you</text><text start="3175.14"

somewhere else how</text><text start="3212.099" dur="4.861">do I think through the accounting of</text><text start="3213.9" dur="4.919">that properly and particularly if it&apos;s</text><text start="3216.96" dur="4.26">very hard to measure because of</text><text start="3218.819" dur="4.081">dispersals and and maybe I don&apos;t even</text><text start="3221.22" dur="4.08">know all the

dur="3.24">solids</text><text start="3232.98" dur="5.82">so this is just an example to start to</text><text start="3235.2" dur="5.82">say it&apos;s hard right it&apos;s hard to ensure</text><text

so just thinking through</text><text start="3258.72" dur="3.599">that is important</text><text start="3260.16" dur="4.62">that&apos;s the first thing and then I was</text><text start="3262.319" dur="6.0">gonna say can I can I interject there</text><text start="3264.78" dur="5.1">just yeah for a quick moment so so in</text><text start="3268.319" dur="3.901">the carbon world what you&apos;re describing</text><text start="3269.88" dur="4.62">is called leakage where you&apos;re you&apos;re</text><text start="3272.22" dur="4.139">working on calculating</text><text start="3274.5"

that in</text><text start="3281.88" dur="5.64">in obviously the from my perspective a</text><text start="3285.059" dur="4.741">logical thing to do is to make sure you</text><text start="3287.52" dur="5.52">you a you track that you incorporate</text><text start="3289.8" dur="6.12">that and you price it high enough to</text><text start="3293.04" dur="4.74">incentivize that larger

dur="5.161">upstream and we&apos;ve got to actually</text><text start="3306.48" dur="6.72">transform this whole system and it&apos;s</text><text start="3309.72" dur="5.339">logical how important that is because</text><text start="3313.2" dur="3.419">you know at the end of the day we are</text><text start="3315.059" dur="3.421">getting to this it&apos;s sort of like we get</text><text

dur="6.421">to go do it right reallocate resources</text><text start="3334.5" dur="4.859">to do that thing so okay so this is</text><text start="3337.74" dur="2.879">actually I&apos;m gonna go where I wanted to</text><text start="3339.359" dur="4.441">go next and then I want to come back to</text><text start="3340.619" dur="5.341">what you just said so let&apos;s say that we</text><text

dur="3.48">environmental destruction so we know</text><text start="3370.8" dur="4.319">that&apos;s not a good enough metric so then</text><text start="3372.839" dur="6.181">we want to start to tack on

let&apos;s say similarly we go to just</text><text start="3383.819" dur="4.161">the regenerative world we say okay we&apos;re</text><text start="3385.8" dur="5.519">going to focus on the metric</text><text start="3387.98" dur="6.04">sequestering CO2 we all know this is</text><text start="3391.319" dur="7.621">like a toy example but we all know that</text><text start="3394.02"

start="3416.94" dur="3.6">so we don&apos;t want carbon reductionism so</text><text start="3418.98" dur="4.44">we have to factor the nitrogen and the</text><text start="3420.54" dur="5.76">phosphorus and the soil microbiota</text><text start="3423.42" dur="6.6">and so then you start to say okay but</text><text start="3426.3" dur="6.42">how much effluent of nitrogen is worth</text><text start="3430.02" dur="6.12">how much of the CO2 now I have this</text><text start="3432.72" dur="5.399">exchange rate but as say in a name</text><text start="3436.14" dur="3.54">there&apos;s almost no

start="3442.319" dur="4.381">to get Co2 out you have a certain</text><text start="3444.0" dur="4.02">exchange rate as the nitrogen starts to</text><text start="3446.7" dur="3.72">increase towards the point of</text><text start="3448.02" dur="4.079">criticality that exchange rate has to</text><text start="3450.42" dur="3.419">change so there&apos;s this dynamically</text><text start="3452.099" dur="3.421">changing based on something other than</text><text start="3453.839" dur="5.041">markets because typically the dynamic</text><text start="3455.52" dur="5.099">exchange is based on each owner of value</text><text start="3458.88" dur="3.9">deciding what they will pay for the</text><text start="3460.619" dur="4.44">thing but here</text><text start="3462.78" dur="3.9">you can&apos;t just have individual owners of</text><text start="3465.059" dur="3.3">value deciding what they will pay for</text><text start="3466.68" dur="3.179">things that are necessary for planetary</text><text

care to invest in that particular</text><text start="3474.119" dur="3.541">thing</text><text start="3475.8" dur="5.819">um and so you have to have something</text><text start="3477.66" dur="5.88">like cost being fixed by law so let&apos;s</text><text start="3481.619" dur="5.161">even say that we have</text><text start="3483.54" dur="4.98">10 or 500 Biometrics that we&apos;re</text><text start="3486.78" dur="4.5">factoring in our resilience and we have</text><text start="3488.52" dur="4.799">some complex algorithm for affecting the</text><text start="3491.28" dur="4.38">weighting of those things then I bring</text><text start="3493.319" dur="5.221">an AI system to exploit it and I say</text><text start="3495.66" dur="4.8">okay well whatever strategy gives</text><text start="3498.54" dur="5.22">there&apos;s going to be some weighted</text><text start="3500.46" dur="6.599">function that will optimize the currency</text><text start="3503.76" dur="5.4">units I can get based on the current you</text><text start="3507.059" dur="5.28">know metric weighting set so I can use</text><text start="3509.16" dur="5.399">an AI to stay how do I optimize my</text><text start="3512.339" dur="3.78">currency extraction and of course it</text><text start="3514.559" dur="3.0">will be addressing carbon and nitrogen</text><text start="3516.119" dur="3.421">and all those things in there but it</text><text start="3517.559" dur="3.841">won&apos;t be addressing the pollinator or</text><text start="3519.54" dur="4.44">whatever thing isn&apos;t in that set yet and</text><text start="3521.4" dur="5.82">factored and so I can externalize harm</text><text start="3523.98" dur="5.16">to whatever is not in the set and or by</text><text start="3527.22" dur="3.78">exploiting an exchange rate that as soon</text><text start="3529.14" dur="3.479">as I exploit it a bit stops making sense</text><text start="3531.0" dur="4.74">but then as soon as people catch it up</text><text start="3532.619" dur="5.22">and realize it my my asymmetrically</text><text start="3535.74" dur="5.64">better than the systems faster AI</text><text start="3537.839" dur="6.24">figures out how to optimize for that so</text><text start="3541.38" dur="6.239">not everyone has an equal ability</text><text start="3544.079" dur="5.581">to exploit Market values so whoever is</text><text start="3547.619" dur="4.081">able to employ higher Tech tools to</text><text start="3549.66" dur="3.959">exploit the market value even in a</text><text start="3551.7" dur="3.54">weighted set of metrics can still end up</text><text start="3553.619" dur="3.0">doing mapping and that&apos;s the thing we</text><text start="3555.24" dur="3.059">have to protect for so you&apos;re talking</text><text start="3556.619" dur="3.301">about you use the AI to do the opposite</text><text start="3558.299" dur="4.441">and this is why it was key that you said</text><text start="3559.92" dur="4.8">it was not a private property ownership</text><text start="3562.74" dur="4.8">model that would incentivize that it was</text><text start="3564.72" dur="4.92">some Commons communal ownership model</text><text start="3567.54" dur="4.2">and you probably have some kind of</text><text start="3569.64" dur="5.34">choice making that is not exclusively</text><text start="3571.74" dur="5.28">associated with ownership right like if</text><text start="3574.98" dur="3.839">someone has a voting right associated</text><text start="3577.02" dur="4.44">with citizenship they can&apos;t actually</text><text start="3578.819" dur="5.28">sell that so it is non-fungible</text><text start="3581.46" dur="4.5">non-transferable and yet you might have</text><text start="3584.099" dur="4.141">certain choices like what gets encoded</text><text start="3585.96" dur="5.7">in rule of law that supersedes economic</text><text start="3588.24" dur="6.42">incentive uh that happen in that space</text><text start="3591.66" dur="5.459">so you could say the voting right is a</text><text start="3594.66" dur="4.22">non-fungible token that has power over</text><text

dur="3.96">democracy with having democracy and</text><text start="3608.94" dur="4.56">markets together it&apos;s just this you can</text><text start="3611.16" dur="4.919">see that the capacity of the

to</text><text start="3624.18" dur="3.78">happen I&apos;m just pointing out some of the</text><text start="3626.46" dur="3.72">things that have to be thought through</text><text start="3627.96" dur="4.379">well in the failure case of those</text><text start="3630.18" dur="5.46">strategies in the process of Designing</text><text start="3632.339" dur="5.161">them totally and and the risk here you</text><text start="3635.64" dur="4.979">know to be frank is that the biggest</text><text start="3637.5" dur="6.72">challenge we face is that thinking goes</text><text start="3640.619" dur="6.301">through well is an anti-signal to</text><text start="3644.22" dur="5.339">investment capital</text><text start="3646.92" dur="6.179">yeah because we&apos;re in the middle of this</text><text start="3649.559" dur="5.941">crazy race to the bottom where you know</text><text start="3653.099" dur="3.96">a VC wants you to not think about those</text><text start="3655.5" dur="3.9">things and they want you to just like</text><text start="3657.059" dur="4.081">get like win the short term game over</text><text start="3659.4" dur="3.419">and over and do that as effectively as</text><text start="3661.14" dur="4.679">possible and if you&apos;re not doing that</text><text start="3662.819" dur="4.881">it&apos;s an anti-signal to investment there</text><text

present moment resources</text><text start="3672.54" dur="3.66">going to come from to really sort of</text><text start="3674.76" dur="3.72">structure and engage with those</text><text start="3676.2" dur="3.859">questions we&apos;ve done a good job of sort</text><text start="3678.48" dur="4.56">of like magically</text><text start="3680.059" dur="5.081">giving ourselves space and time although</text><text start="3683.04" dur="4.5">you know that that doesn&apos;t doesn&apos;t last</text><text start="3685.14" dur="4.32">forever and the amount of space and time</text><text start="3687.54" dur="5.519">needed to think through and just design</text><text start="3689.46" dur="6.72">like go through design exercises Pilots</text><text start="3693.059" dur="5.341">be humble and like expect to be wrong</text><text start="3696.18" dur="5.399">and sort of continue to set up the right</text><text start="3698.4" dur="5.04">sandboxes for this you know because at</text><text start="3701.579" dur="5.28">the end of the day I think I completely</text><text start="3703.44" dur="5.76">resonate with your intuition Daniel that</text><text start="3706.859" dur="4.081">you know in order for this to work we</text><text start="3709.2" dur="4.379">actually have to get down and and</text><text start="3710.94" dur="6.0">redefine sort of like the Monopoly on</text><text start="3713.579" dur="6.121">private property and exiting rights and</text><text start="3716.94" dur="5.46">that&apos;s really key to to setting things</text><text start="3719.7" dur="4.44">up so that they work well is you know</text><text start="3722.4" dur="3.899">really at the end of the day I believe</text><text start="3724.14" dur="4.38">this is all a</text><text start="3726.299" dur="3.901">um an exercise in re-embedding markets</text><text start="3728.52" dur="5.88">into Commons</text><text start="3730.2" dur="6.48">right because that that&apos;s how markets</text><text start="3734.4" dur="4.56">can be a force for coordination instead</text><text start="3736.68" dur="4.8">of just sort of like this you know this</text><text start="3738.96" dur="5.82">race in which value extraction is is</text><text start="3741.48" dur="5.639">optimized embedding markets in Commons I</text><text start="3744.78" dur="4.86">think is a really good high level tag</text><text start="3747.119" dur="4.801">for a lot of things that needs to happen</text><text start="3749.64" dur="4.919">Jason where are you at in this</text><text start="3751.92" dur="5.04">conversation that sort of emerged you</text><text start="3754.559" dur="4.621">know and rapidly sped off as I was like</text><text start="3756.96" dur="3.8">oh oh this is you know this is what</text><text start="3759.18" dur="4.74">we&apos;re working on exactly</text><text start="3760.76" dur="4.839">well I&apos;m I&apos;m enjoying listening uh to</text><text start="3763.92" dur="4.58">this I find this interesting I mean in</text><text start="3765.599" dur="7.921">the back of my mind what I&apos;m thinking is</text><text start="3768.5" dur="7.42">let&apos;s say that somehow uh your vision</text><text start="3773.52" dur="4.339">was achieved Gregory and we were able to</text><text start="3775.92" dur="4.56">internalize all of the externalities</text><text start="3777.859" dur="5.321">what would that mean about how Society</text><text start="3780.48" dur="5.9">is structured and this goes back to</text><text start="3783.18" dur="6.6">my idea about kind of networked</text><text start="3786.38" dur="5.52">bioregionalism or Cosmopolitan localism</text><text start="3789.78" dur="6.12">or you know whatever kind of</text><text start="3791.9" dur="5.679">uh you know vague kind of generality you</text><text start="3795.9" dur="4.38">know we want to think about and and to</text><text start="3797.579" dur="4.201">me it&apos;s still like you know if if we&apos;re</text><text start="3800.28" dur="4.62">moving away from linear systems and</text><text start="3801.78" dur="5.64">there&apos;s a lot more recycling of minerals</text><text start="3804.9" dur="4.439">um we developed technology to do that I</text><text start="3807.42" dur="4.56">still think that there&apos;s going to be</text><text start="3809.339" dur="5.76">more focus and maybe you I&apos;m curious if</text><text start="3811.98" dur="4.319">you agree on local production of some</text><text start="3815.099" dur="4.26">things</text><text start="3816.299" dur="5.28">um I think food is a big one and so it&apos;s</text><text start="3819.359" dur="3.781">a and and is less efficient because you</text><text start="3821.579" dur="4.26">don&apos;t have the economies of scale and so</text><text start="3823.14" dur="5.459">it&apos;s an implicit kind of degrowth which</text><text start="3825.839" dur="6.0">you know many people think needs to</text><text start="3828.599" dur="5.341">happen anyway right and but we still</text><text start="3831.839" dur="3.48">need Global coordination we need Global</text><text start="3833.94" dur="4.2">Tech especially</text><text start="3835.319" dur="5.04">in the digital Tech sphere uh and Mining</text><text start="3838.14" dur="5.28">of key minerals and things and so</text><text start="3840.359" dur="4.081">there&apos;ll still be global trade but uh</text><text start="3843.42" dur="4.62">and there are still big Global</text><text start="3844.44" dur="5.7">coordination but I I guess what is you</text><text start="3848.04" dur="4.44">know if all this goes according to plan</text><text start="3850.14" dur="4.02">how is society structured differently</text><text start="3852.48" dur="4.68">like like do you have an idea about that</text><text start="3854.16" dur="5.72">or we just have no way of knowing I</text><text start="3857.16" dur="6.0">certainly have ideas I I&apos;d love to hear</text><text

another case</text><text start="4106.279" dur="5.161">um this actually comes up for me today</text><text start="4108.199" dur="5.701">in terms of my concerns about how much</text><text start="4111.44" dur="4.799">utilitarian ethics are proliferating as</text><text start="4113.9" dur="5.16">we&apos;re doing planning ethics and machine</text><text start="4116.239" dur="4.5">learning so that the

start="4146.06" dur="6.119">um in that specific example do you know</text><text start="4149.719" dur="4.441">if anyone is thinking about what it</text><text start="4152.179" dur="4.5">would look like to allow a driver to</text><text start="4154.16" dur="4.86">program in their own choice about that</text><text start="4156.679" dur="4.62">like the owner of the car or a company</text><text start="4159.02" dur="5.46">that you know owns a fleet or something</text><text start="4161.299" dur="5.341">to say you know we would you know</text><text start="4164.48" dur="4.739">because people make those choices maybe</text><text start="4166.64" dur="4.5">in Split Second decisions but you know</text><text start="4169.219" dur="3.841">people do make that that&apos;s a decision</text><text start="4171.14" dur="4.8">that usually that that agency would</text><text start="4173.06" dur="5.279">usually sort of best down to a person in</text><text start="4175.94" dur="4.5">the driver&apos;s

start="4182.319" dur="4.9">yeah so the I mean that&apos;s a very</text><text start="4185.48" dur="4.5">complicated topic is when you start to</text><text start="4187.219" dur="5.1">have these very complex cybernated</text><text start="4189.98" dur="5.219">systems that control on this hibernated</text><text start="4192.319" dur="5.101">systems affects a lot so do we try to</text><text

being thought of in all of</text><text start="4202.4" dur="4.62">these places I would say one of the</text><text start="4204.38" dur="4.98">places the conversation has advanced a</text><text start="4207.02" dur="4.32">lot is the control of social media</text><text start="4209.36" dur="3.72">algorithm settings knowing how</text><text start="4211.34" dur="4.02">problematic they are currently when you</text><text start="4213.08" dur="4.86">optimize for time on site and engagement</text><text start="4215.36" dur="5.64">in ways that increase</text><text start="4217.94" dur="4.2">depression and tribalism and sanctimony</text><text start="4221.0" dur="3.179">and</text><text start="4222.14" dur="5.039">um certainty and wrongness at the same</text><text start="4224.179" dur="4.321">time it&apos;s obvious that they need control</text><text start="4227.179" dur="3.48">differently</text><text start="4228.5" dur="4.14">does the government step in to control</text><text start="4230.659" dur="3.961">the algorithm and ensure that it&apos;s in</text><text start="4232.64" dur="5.519">some positive fiduciary relationship</text><text start="4234.62" dur="6.42">with the society and the individuals who</text><text start="4238.159" dur="6.0">kind of figures out and adjudicates what</text><text start="4241.04" dur="5.06">that algorithm set should be or does</text><text start="4244.159" dur="4.741">each user get to decide for themselves</text><text start="4246.1" dur="5.2">and can the user even actually do that</text><text start="4248.9" dur="5.759">well if they can&apos;t Factor the complexity</text><text start="4251.3" dur="4.439">of what the non-obvious effects of those</text><text start="4254.659" dur="3.781">settings are</text><text start="4255.739" dur="4.44">and then also what are the default</text><text start="4258.44" dur="4.14">settings because even if I can change</text><text start="4260.179" dur="5.461">the settings almost nobody will and so</text><text start="4262.58" dur="5.34">the ease of change in the default</text><text start="4265.64" dur="5.22">settings end up being significant so</text><text start="4267.92" dur="5.22">yeah I think this is a very important uh</text><text start="4270.86" dur="5.1">it&apos;s a very important topic</text><text start="4273.14" dur="6.059">but the place I was going is utopianism</text><text start="4275.96" dur="5.64">causing violence the version right now</text><text start="4279.199" dur="4.741">that I see a lot is</text><text start="4281.6" dur="5.34">um especially you know the EA movement</text><text start="4283.94" dur="6.779">and places that think about long-termism</text><text start="4286.94" dur="7.799">through utilitarian ethical lenses</text><text start="4290.719" dur="6.361">can say in the most amount of suffering</text><text start="4294.739" dur="4.44">could occur and the most amount of</text><text start="4297.08" dur="4.02">benefit could occur by Humanity

dur="4.56">we&apos;re in interplanetary species so to</text><text start="4304.159" dur="4.381">the amount of harm that happens from not</text><text start="4306.86" dur="4.2">getting there</text><text start="4308.54" dur="3.96">is so much more that it justifies</text><text start="4311.06" dur="5.54">anything we need to do to get there</text><text start="4312.5" dur="6.54">therefore dot dot dot and in the name of</text><text start="4316.6" dur="4.66">excessive epistemic certainty about</text><text start="4319.04" dur="4.199">future cases we can justify a lot of</text><text start="4321.26" dur="3.12">violence now because it&apos;s less harmful</text><text start="4323.239" dur="3.541">than the other thing in our thought</text><text start="4324.38" dur="4.2">model and of course we can do this with</text><text start="4326.78" dur="5.459">climate change because climate change is</text><text start="4328.58" dur="7.079">going to be so bad we need to do X Y and</text><text start="4332.239" dur="6.241">Z geoengineering project so I would say</text><text start="4335.659" dur="5.221">in general the I want people to forecast</text><text start="4338.48" dur="4.92">and make good choices now based on that</text><text start="4340.88" dur="4.74">but I&apos;m also dubious of them being over</text><text start="4343.4" dur="4.259">certain of their forecasts and as a</text><text start="4345.62" dur="4.38">result from a totally ethical standpoint</text><text start="4347.659" dur="5.761">justifying harmful actions now because</text><text start="4350.0" dur="4.8">it seems less harmful than inaction and</text><text start="4353.42" dur="3.84">so how to make sure that when you&apos;re</text><text start="4354.8" dur="4.2">doing that thing you&apos;re calculating</text><text start="4357.26" dur="3.6">that you&apos;re weighing your own</text><text start="4359.0" dur="2.96">uncertainty heavily enough is really</text><text start="4360.86" dur="3.96">important</text><text start="4361.96" dur="4.719">disclaimer noted now we want to hear the</text><text start="4364.82" dur="4.919">vision of you of the future that you</text><text start="4366.679" dur="5.701">want to see and live in so let&apos;s say</text><text start="4369.739" dur="6.301">that we look at a civilization using the</text><text start="4372.38" dur="5.52">Marvin Harris model of a civilization is</text><text start="4376.04" dur="3.84">can be thought of in terms of its</text><text start="4377.9" dur="3.9">infrastructure its social structures and</text><text start="4379.88" dur="4.38">its superstructure infrastructure being</text><text start="4381.8" dur="4.859">the entire technology stack that it</text><text start="4384.26" dur="4.38">utilizes social structures being all of</text><text start="4386.659" dur="4.201">the agreement Fields the economics the</text><text start="4388.64" dur="4.74">governance the law the institutions that</text><text start="4390.86" dur="5.04">it uses for Collective Choice making and</text><text start="4393.38" dur="3.74">the superstructure being its culture and</text><text start="4395.9" dur="4.2">it&apos;s basically</text><text start="4397.12" dur="5.74">shared values definition of the good</text><text start="4400.1" dur="3.9">life things like that so if we instead</text><text start="4402.86" dur="3.02">of saying infrastructure social</text><text start="4404.0" dur="4.679">structure superstructure we could say</text><text start="4405.88" dur="4.72">technology political economy and culture</text><text start="4408.679" dur="3.721">something like that then we could say</text><text start="4410.6" dur="3.72">these three things inevitably interact</text><text start="4412.4" dur="3.72">with each other no one is the most</text><text start="4414.32" dur="4.14">fundamental different schools of thought</text><text start="4416.12" dur="4.14">will argue like Marvin Harris are a good</text><text start="4418.46" dur="4.14">actually infrastructure drives the other</text><text start="4420.26" dur="4.26">ones almost exclusively almost every</text><text start="4422.6" dur="4.139">spiritual and religious ideology says</text><text start="4424.52" dur="4.5">why superstructure can guide the other</text><text start="4426.739" dur="3.781">ones obviously when insofar as we&apos;re</text><text start="4429.02" dur="2.76">thinking about economic theory and</text><text start="4430.52" dur="2.699">theory of governance we&apos;re focused on</text><text start="4431.78" dur="3.18">the way the social structures will go to</text><text start="4433.219" dur="4.321">the other ones so just to go very fast</text><text start="4434.96" dur="4.92">through this they all interact each</text><text start="4437.54" dur="4.8">other and there are necessary things</text><text start="4439.88" dur="4.799">that must happen criteria wise in each</text><text start="4442.34" dur="4.26">of those that lead to a set of</text><text start="4444.679" dur="5.401">reinforcing dynamics that can lead to a</text><text start="4446.6" dur="6.599">meta-stable civilization and so if we</text><text start="4450.08" dur="5.159">were to talk about uh great what you&apos;re</text><text start="4453.199" dur="3.721">saying each of those three is nested in</text><text start="4455.239" dur="3.661">ecology yes of course these are the</text><text start="4456.92" dur="4.319">three three aspects of kind of human</text><text start="4458.9" dur="5.04">civilization and exactly we&apos;re totally</text><text start="4461.239" dur="5.281">nested in ecology and you could say the</text><text start="4463.94" dur="4.5">ecology is nested in physics if you want</text><text start="4466.52" dur="5.4">so a couple of things</text><text start="4468.44" dur="5.46">we talk about the infrastructure side a</text><text start="4471.92" dur="2.88">lot though in this conversation we&apos;ve</text><text start="4473.9" dur="2.24">actually been talking about social</text><text start="4474.8" dur="4.26">structure</text><text start="4476.14" dur="4.42">currencies and governance and like that</text><text start="4479.06" dur="3.78">but we&apos;ve been talking about abstractly</text><text start="4480.56" dur="4.08">we talk about infrastructure like a</text><text start="4482.84" dur="4.5">closed-loop materials economy we have to</text><text start="4484.64" dur="4.019">ensure that we are not uh meeting human</text><text start="4487.34" dur="2.58">needs</text><text start="4488.659" dur="4.02">via</text><text start="4489.92" dur="4.319">turning nature unrenewably into Meeting</text><text start="4492.679" dur="3.601">those human needs and particularly</text><text start="4494.239" dur="4.321">unrenewably at larger scales and can</text><text start="4496.28" dur="4.8">continue to happen and then creating</text><text start="4498.56" dur="5.76">waste faster than can be processed so</text><text start="4501.08" dur="5.579">one you have to move to completely</text><text start="4504.32" dur="4.46">closed loop Atomic accounting like at an</text><text start="4506.659" dur="4.741">atomic and molecular level closed loops</text><text start="4508.78" dur="4.12">and you have to go post growth that</text><text start="4511.4" dur="3.24">doesn&apos;t mean there can&apos;t be growth but</text><text start="4512.9" dur="4.319">it means that the embedded growth</text><text start="4514.64" dur="3.96">obligation has to go away so that any</text><text start="4517.219" dur="3.48">growth that happens is actually</text><text start="4518.6" dur="4.5">calibratable with the environment</text><text start="4520.699" dur="6.181">so now what actually does that materials</text><text start="4523.1" dur="6.36">economy look like I think well obviously</text><text start="4526.88" dur="6.24">our energy production has to transition</text><text start="4529.46" dur="5.82">in that world to a uh renewable energy</text><text start="4533.12" dur="5.52">source and a post-pollution energy</text><text start="4535.28" dur="5.7">source or where we can be processing</text><text start="4538.64" dur="5.28">that pollution within a</text><text start="4540.98" dur="4.739">a set of processes that can be described</text><text start="4543.92" dur="4.319">as closed loop adequately</text><text start="4545.719" dur="4.201">and I think that this is where if you</text><text start="4548.239" dur="3.5">just say what is the very long term what</text><text start="4549.92" dur="5.16">versus what is the very nearer term</text><text start="4551.739" dur="5.141">near-term based on intermittency issues</text><text start="4555.08" dur="4.079">and based on energy return on energy</text><text start="4556.88" dur="5.66">investment</text><text start="4559.159" dur="6.721">um do we get off of hydrocarbons</text><text start="4562.54" dur="6.159">exclusively with kind of decentralized</text><text start="4565.88" dur="5.94">Renewables probably not</text><text start="4568.699" dur="5.161">um probably some large-scale centralized</text><text start="4571.82" dur="5.399">renewable type things like deep</text><text start="4573.86" dur="5.4">geothermal and maybe space based solar</text><text start="4577.219" dur="4.801">whatever are probably important</text><text start="4579.26" dur="4.32">and probably nuclear is important but</text><text start="4582.02" dur="4.8">here&apos;s where I would say</text><text start="4583.58" dur="6.119">thorium nuclear and phase three or phase</text><text start="4586.82" dur="5.399">four and micronuclear in non-seismic</text><text start="4589.699" dur="4.381">areas with hardened energy grids and</text><text start="4592.219" dur="4.381">different waste management is really</text><text start="4594.08" dur="4.32">really different than phase one and</text><text start="4596.6" dur="3.9">phase two nuclear without a hardened</text><text start="4598.4" dur="3.6">energy Grid in seismic areas so you</text><text start="4600.5" dur="2.82">shouldn&apos;t think of nuclear as a category</text><text start="4602.0" dur="3.48">just like you shouldn&apos;t think of</text><text start="4603.32" dur="6.18">vaccines as a category you should think</text><text start="4605.48" dur="6.42">of each one with its own unique pros and</text><text start="4609.5" dur="4.26">cons but there is obviously</text><text start="4611.9" dur="3.36">it takes a certain amount of hydrocarbon</text><text start="4613.76" dur="3.78">energy to build any of the new energy</text><text start="4615.26" dur="4.08">since that&apos;s where energy comes from so</text><text start="4617.54" dur="4.08">there is a transition of the energy</text><text start="4619.34" dur="4.8">economy and then a transition of our</text><text start="4621.62" dur="4.559">materials acquisition and our waste</text><text start="4624.14" dur="3.78">management and so we can think about</text><text start="4626.179" dur="3.48">that there&apos;s a whole lot more in terms</text><text start="4627.92" dur="3.12">of what should be local what should be</text><text start="4629.659" dur="3.241">at various scales what should be at the</text><text start="4631.04" dur="3.72">city scale the bioregion scale

the</text><text start="4822.38" dur="6.62">critical path or like the the past</text><text start="4824.239" dur="9.121">dependency you know what what how do we</text><text start="4829.0" dur="8.199">dance along that line to come decompose</text><text start="4833.36" dur="5.76">or compost or re you know allow people</text><text start="4837.199" dur="4.621">to to regenerate or evolve their</text><text start="4839.12" dur="5.34">worldview you know because obviously if</text><text start="4841.82" dur="5.96">you impose if if you act with a world</text><text start="4844.46"

into it right so</text><text start="4853.04" dur="4.679">what&apos;s the yeah I&apos;d love to hear you</text><text start="4855.62" dur="4.32">Riff on that for just a moment</text><text start="4857.719" dur="4.921">um in service to like toggling back and</text><text start="4859.94" dur="4.14">forth between the the ends and the means</text><text start="4862.64" dur="4.079">yeah</text><text start="4864.08" dur="5.28">um okay so first let&apos;s when we say</text><text start="4866.719" dur="5.641">Warfare we usually mean actual physical</text><text start="4869.36" dur="5.7">violence so called kinetic Warfare but</text><text start="4872.36" dur="4.799">sometimes we can talk about peace time</text><text start="4875.06" dur="3.84">where we engage in trade and politics</text><text start="4877.159" dur="4.141">and diplomacy and then wartime where we</text><text start="4878.9" dur="5.22">engage in bombs but the other way to</text><text start="4881.3" dur="6.3">look at it is a Continuum of navigating</text><text start="4884.12" dur="6.36">conflict where you know bunclosovit says</text><text start="4887.6" dur="4.38">war is politics by other means which</text><text start="4890.48" dur="3.36">that same statement can be reversed the</text><text start="4891.98" dur="5.28">other way so in that way you can talk</text><text start="4893.84" dur="5.339">about kinetic Warfare in the context of</text><text start="4897.26" dur="3.6">economic Warfare diplomatic Warfare</text><text start="4899.179" dur="3.661">cultural Warfare information Warfare</text><text start="4900.86" dur="5.4">population Center Warfare and</text><text start="4902.84" dur="5.7">particularly since the proliferation of</text><text start="4906.26" dur="4.86">things like fifth generation population</text><text start="4908.54" dur="4.92">Centric Warfare are actually primary</text><text start="4911.12" dur="5.64">strategies of nation states against each</text><text start="4913.46" dur="4.8">other the clear line of using bombs to</text><text start="4916.76" dur="4.14">attack each other versus not is really</text><text start="4918.26" dur="5.399">gone so then we&apos;re really looking at</text><text start="4920.9" dur="4.62">kind of conflict theory and</text><text start="4923.659" dur="3.901">um and so you can even see that the left</text><text start="4925.52" dur="3.78">and right inside of the US are engaged</text><text start="4927.56" dur="3.36">in a culture War right and if the war</text><text start="4929.3" dur="4.14">and culture war against each other where</text><text start="4930.92" dur="4.62">each of the last few elections feels</text><text start="4933.44" dur="4.5">existential to the entire Republican</text><text start="4935.54" dur="3.36">system if our guy doesn&apos;t win to the</text><text start="4937.94" dur="3.54">other guy</text><text start="4938.9" dur="4.44">to the other side and so obviously a</text><text start="4941.48" dur="3.78">democracy breaks down if your fellow</text><text start="4943.34" dur="3.6">countrymen are the enemy are in</text><text start="4945.26" dur="4.2">existentially terrible enemy that you&apos;re</text><text start="4946.94" dur="5.46">at war with there is no kind of common</text><text start="4949.46" dur="5.52">Unity basis but what I and so what you</text><text start="4952.4" dur="5.04">see is that the left will say things</text><text start="4954.98" dur="4.98">that appeal to the left even if they</text><text start="4957.44" dur="4.98">totally villainize the right because</text><text start="4959.96" dur="4.8">there is no anti-incentive in the</text><text start="4962.42" dur="3.96">current governance system immediately</text><text start="4964.76" dur="4.02">for villainizing the other side and</text><text start="4966.38" dur="3.66">pissing them off because you you know if</text><text start="4968.78" dur="3.919">you had something like ranked Choice</text><text start="4970.04" dur="4.619">voting you would actually be</text><text start="4972.699" dur="4.421">disincentivized for doing that highly</text><text start="4974.659" dur="5.04">polarizing thing because whoever gets</text><text start="4977.12" dur="4.32">voted very last does much worse and so</text><text start="4979.699" dur="3.421">you&apos;d have an incentive to appeal across</text><text start="4981.44" dur="3.48">the entire space but where the current</text><text start="4983.12" dur="3.42">incentive is mostly just to appeal to</text><text start="4984.92" dur="3.0">your own side you can do it by</text><text start="4986.54" dur="4.26">villainizing the other but then of</text><text start="4987.92" dur="5.16">course the other gets existentially</text><text start="4990.8" dur="4.379">scared enough from that they mount a</text><text start="4993.08" dur="3.659">more powerful and counter response next</text><text start="4995.179" dur="3.121">time they get elected whatever you did</text><text start="4996.739" dur="2.46">in four years gets undone in the next</text><text start="4998.3" dur="3.12">four years</text><text start="4999.199" dur="3.54">and whatever strategies of warfare that</text><text start="5001.42" dur="3.06">you learned that were effective they</text><text start="5002.739" dur="3.301">reverse engineered made better next time</text><text start="5004.48" dur="3.66">and so the net result is just an</text><text start="5006.04" dur="3.78">escalation of an arms race and the</text><text start="5008.14" dur="3.36">escalation of the arms race means the</text><text start="5009.82" dur="2.7">consequences just keep getting worse and</text><text start="5011.5" dur="3.179">worse</text><text start="5012.52" dur="4.62">so if you&apos;re not totally</text><text start="5014.679" dur="3.661">short-sighted you will stop that</text><text start="5017.14" dur="3.059">um if you&apos;re totally short-sighted</text><text start="5018.34" dur="3.3">you&apos;ll say we&apos;ll deal with that later we</text><text start="5020.199" dur="3.121">have to win the selection whatever it</text><text start="5021.64" dur="3.0">takes villainize the other side tell</text><text start="5023.32" dur="4.26">some lies so long as you can get away</text><text start="5024.64" dur="4.62">with them you know whatever it is</text><text start="5027.58" dur="3.78">um but if you realize that whatever you</text><text start="5029.26" dur="4.08">do that&apos;s so important that it it&apos;s</text><text start="5031.36" dur="4.26">worth doing that in these four years</text><text start="5033.34" dur="4.379">we&apos;ll all get undone in the next ones</text><text start="5035.62" dur="3.539">and you&apos;re equipping the other side to</text><text start="5037.719" dur="2.761">be more powerful by whatever new</text><text start="5039.159" dur="2.821">strategies you figure out that they&apos;ll</text><text start="5040.48" dur="3.66">reverse engineer</text><text start="5041.98" dur="5.46">then you calm yourself down a little bit</text><text start="5044.14" dur="5.4">and say okay not just if I&apos;m going to</text><text start="5047.44" dur="4.08">share a message</text><text start="5049.54" dur="4.139">uh how do I share a message that appeals</text><text start="5051.52" dur="3.3">with my intended user base but who&apos;s not</text><text start="5053.679" dur="2.401">going to like and agree with this</text><text start="5054.82" dur="3.24">message and how are they going to</text><text start="5056.08" dur="4.98">respond you&apos;ve got to think about that</text><text start="5058.06" dur="5.52">so thinking through the long-term</text><text start="5061.06" dur="5.4">failure of culture War can get someone</text><text start="5063.58" dur="6.24">to stop it and in the same way with</text><text start="5066.46" dur="6.84">Kinetic War thinking through</text><text start="5069.82" dur="6.06">um okay so in an escalating arms race of</text><text start="5073.3" dur="4.32">this on all new exponential Technologies</text><text start="5075.88" dur="4.26">where we&apos;re going to weaponize Gene</text><text start="5077.62" dur="5.4">specific bio weapons and</text><text start="5080.14" dur="4.559">um autonomous AI weapon systems and this</text><text start="5083.02" dur="3.06">means it&apos;s smaller and smaller actors</text><text start="5084.699" dur="3.0">are going to have catastrophic weapons</text><text start="5086.08" dur="4.619">like who the wants to live in that</text><text start="5087.699" dur="5.401">world and how does anyone deploy that</text><text start="5090.699" dur="4.681">Tech and ensure that it doesn&apos;t then get</text><text start="5093.1" dur="6.0">deployed against them so there is a way</text><text start="5095.38" dur="7.02">that anyone who&apos;s engaged in war out of</text><text start="5099.1" dur="6.42">necessity can think through the</text><text start="5102.4" dur="6.36">long-term non-viability of that path and</text><text start="5105.52" dur="5.58">start to say is there a better path</text><text start="5108.76" dur="5.28">if you think that path is viable though</text><text start="5111.1" dur="5.7">you might go for it and I&apos;m not saying</text><text start="5114.04" dur="5.159">in the current world there is no place</text><text start="5116.8" dur="4.7">for war if you have a group that has</text><text start="5119.199" dur="4.621">been highly conditioned with</text><text start="5121.5" dur="4.06">ethnocentric genocidal cleansing</text><text start="5123.82" dur="3.54">ideologies and their weaponized and</text><text start="5125.56" dur="3.96">they&apos;re willing to move with that you</text><text start="5127.36" dur="4.02">can&apos;t necessarily not engage with that</text><text start="5129.52" dur="5.1">but the question is how to engage with</text><text start="5131.38" dur="5.22">it only in kind of absolute necessity</text><text start="5134.62" dur="3.9">and orienting towards a case of getting</text><text start="5136.6" dur="4.26">out of that thing and that&apos;s actually</text><text start="5138.52" dur="4.92">very tricky because</text><text start="5140.86" dur="5.22">I don&apos;t think you can say let&apos;s never</text><text start="5143.44" dur="5.759">physically engage in War I think you</text><text start="5146.08" dur="4.619">just your ideology will lose but if</text><text start="5149.199" dur="3.301">you&apos;re successful at it you usually</text><text start="5150.699" dur="4.261">think about how to keep using that same</text><text start="5152.5" dur="4.32">success principle so to say how do we</text><text start="5154.96" dur="3.9">use a success principle only when we&apos;re</text><text start="5156.82" dur="4.68">necessary well obsoleting the thing that</text><text start="5158.86" dur="5.339">made us successful is a type of frame of</text><text start="5161.5" dur="5.34">mind that is necessary but not common</text><text start="5164.199" dur="5.221">yeah I feel like you&apos;re sort of sharing</text><text start="5166.84" dur="6.72">you know it&apos;s like Machiavelli&apos;s Prince</text><text start="5169.42" dur="6.36">this is like uh schmachtenberger&apos;s you</text><text start="5173.56" dur="3.74">know Prince 2.0</text><text start="5175.78" dur="3.72">like if you&apos;re going to be a leader</text><text start="5177.3" dur="5.14">these are the things that you need to</text><text start="5179.5" dur="7.739">think through in order to have a</text><text start="5182.44" dur="7.44">longevity and and stability in in power</text><text start="5187.239" dur="3.721">is a responsible not that Machiavelli</text><text start="5189.88" dur="3.66">was necessarily concerned with</text><text start="5190.96" dur="5.34">responsibility but you know maybe not</text><text start="5193.54" dur="6.42">given like yeah game B Machiavelli yeah</text><text start="5196.3" dur="4.919">but I think game I think Machiavelli was</text><text start="5199.96" dur="4.08">saying</text><text start="5201.219" dur="5.041">if you want to be effective at all in</text><text start="5204.04" dur="4.38">protecting your people or engaging in</text><text start="5206.26" dur="4.5">anything like these are principles that</text><text start="5208.42" dur="4.86">are at play you must understand them but</text><text start="5210.76" dur="5.16">then what we&apos;re saying is the ongoing</text><text start="5213.28" dur="4.62">arms race of everyone employing those</text><text start="5215.92" dur="3.779">principles more effectively in the short</text><text start="5217.9" dur="4.14">term actually ruins everything in the</text><text start="5219.699" dur="3.901">long term and yet if you don&apos;t employ</text><text start="5222.04" dur="4.08">them at all in the short term you&apos;ll</text><text start="5223.6" dur="5.28">probably just fail so how do you not</text><text start="5226.12" dur="4.92">fail in the short term while seeking to</text><text start="5228.88" dur="3.72">change the entire game rather than just</text><text start="5231.04" dur="3.119">continue to escalate it because winning</text><text start="5232.6" dur="4.44">it doesn&apos;t equal winning it forever it</text><text start="5234.159" dur="4.801">equals escalating it yeah no for sure</text><text start="5237.04" dur="3.84">and I think that that&apos;s a that&apos;s a</text><text start="5238.96" dur="6.719">that&apos;s a really important that sort of</text><text start="5240.88" dur="8.7">like not losing while changing the

dur="6.901">how do we develop culture or then</text><text start="5608.62" dur="7.559">culture can be turned into governance</text><text start="5613.12" dur="5.16">rule of law Etc which can buy and guide</text><text start="5616.179" dur="4.56">and direct the tech then you have to</text><text start="5618.28" dur="4.14">have a society that&apos;s investing in that</text><text start="5620.739"

dur="4.201">was the first level of me wanting to</text><text start="5649.06" dur="4.8">address the question of long-term future</text><text start="5651.34" dur="5.52">of civilization at a criteria

esoteric a bit</text><text start="5878.26" dur="4.379">Meandering and left more threads open</text><text start="5880.179" dur="3.901">than it closed but um I still enjoyed</text><text start="5882.639"

start="5902.62" dur="4.2">it would be fun to do a little bit of a</text><text start="5904.78" dur="4.14">a series Dialogue on some of these</text><text start="5906.82" dur="4.56">especially the future of food I think</text><text start="5908.92" dur="4.44">that&apos;d be really fun to dig into and</text><text start="5911.38" dur="3.359">talk about in more depth but you know</text><text

dur="4.2">do you have any uh thoughts Reflections</text><text start="5925.48" dur="4.98">uh any anything you want to leave the</text><text start="5927.82" dur="4.62">audience with as we close out well I</text><text start="5930.46" dur="5.64">just want to thank you guys I thought</text><text start="5932.44" dur="6.779">this was stimulating for me yeah I guess</text><text start="5936.1" dur="4.26">a couple closing thoughts one you know I</text><text start="5939.219" dur="4.621">think what we&apos;re trying to do with</text><text start="5940.36" dur="5.52">doomor optimism is one it&apos;s a</text><text start="5943.84" dur="3.66">recognition so like what you&apos;re talking</text><text start="5945.88" dur="2.759">about Daniel and all of these</text><text start="5947.5" dur="3.3">considerations</text><text start="5948.639" dur="4.681">I&apos;m glad that there&apos;s people out there</text><text start="5950.8" dur="5.22">that are that are doing this and I and</text><text start="5953.32" dur="6.18">you know I hope more orders of magnitude</text><text start="5956.02" dur="5.82">more people think in these terms uh and</text><text start="5959.5" dur="5.1">their kind of responsibility for</text><text start="5961.84" dur="4.08">larger scale systems I I but I also</text><text start="5964.6" dur="4.079">think that a lot of people aren&apos;t going</text><text start="5965.92" dur="4.56">to to do that and I think what we&apos;re</text><text start="5968.679" dur="3.5">trying to do with doom optimism is give</text><text start="5970.48" dur="6.659">people a very kind of</text><text start="5972.179" dur="7.901">tangible way to ReDiscover value in</text><text start="5977.139" dur="6.361">their life and tangibility in their life</text><text start="5980.08" dur="5.159">you know by say starting a homestead</text><text start="5983.5" dur="4.44">maybe that&apos;s helping you kick your</text><text start="5985.239" dur="5.881">internet addiction and it&apos;s helping you</text><text start="5987.94" dur="8.52">think more crucially about technology</text><text start="5991.12" dur="7.26">and energy and uh Loops in the biosphere</text><text start="5996.46" dur="5.4">and</text><text start="5998.38" dur="4.62">because you&apos;re not an atomized agent uh</text><text start="6001.86" dur="3.0">perhaps you&apos;re</text><text start="6003.0" dur="4.44">you know engaged in culture building</text><text start="6004.86" dur="5.299">again developing relationships and</text><text start="6007.44" dur="5.759">because you&apos;re also on the internet some</text><text start="6010.159" dur="4.961">you&apos;re you&apos;re still you&apos;re not becoming</text><text start="6013.199" dur="3.661">hopefully that&apos;s this is my hope not</text><text start="6015.12" dur="6.24">you&apos;re not becoming so inward focused</text><text start="6016.86" dur="7.74">that you know that you become you know</text><text start="6021.36" dur="5.46">either uncaring or ignorance of the</text><text start="6024.6" dur="5.28">larger responsibility that that you&apos;re a</text><text start="6026.82" dur="6.899">part of and the political economy uh</text><text start="6029.88" dur="5.7">social structure I I think that&apos;s well</text><text start="6033.719" dur="3.721">you&apos;re you&apos;re you&apos;re you&apos;re placing</text><text start="6035.58" dur="4.619">certain limits on yourself or you&apos;re</text><text start="6037.44" dur="5.1">trying to by localizing right instead of</text><text start="6040.199" dur="4.98">just buying the thing always on Amazon</text><text start="6042.54" dur="4.619">which we all do but in you know trying</text><text start="6045.179" dur="3.661">you know perhaps you could get it</text><text start="6047.159" dur="3.0">locally from a neighbor or in your</text><text start="6048.84" dur="3.96">county or you could make it yourself</text><text start="6050.159" dur="4.741">right and so and and there&apos;s an implicit</text><text start="6052.8" dur="3.78">kind of degrowth implication of that as</text><text start="6054.9" dur="3.66">well because it&apos;s necessarily not as</text><text start="6056.58" dur="4.26">efficient uh if you&apos;re not accounting</text><text start="6058.56" dur="4.44">for externalities and so I I&apos;d like to</text><text start="6060.84" dur="4.5">think that the projects are complement</text><text start="6063.0" dur="4.44">injury but maybe they&apos;re working on</text><text start="6065.34" dur="5.76">different scales and so I guess I&apos;ll</text><text start="6067.44" dur="6.719">leave it there yeah and I think if again</text><text start="6071.1" dur="6.42">I don&apos;t know the audience in your world</text><text start="6074.159" dur="5.161">well but if there were people who felt</text><text start="6077.52" dur="3.3">apathetic and hopeless about the macro</text><text start="6079.32" dur="3.419">scale of the world and their optimism</text><text start="6080.82" dur="4.8">came from decreasing the scale of like</text><text start="6082.739" dur="5.221">maybe I do have agency over my own life</text><text start="6085.62" dur="3.96">maybe over my own local region more and</text><text start="6087.96" dur="4.199">maybe there is something net positive I</text><text start="6089.58" dur="4.139">can do for the World by at least not</text><text start="6092.159" dur="6.0">being</text><text start="6093.719" dur="6.9">part of or not contributing to the</text><text start="6098.159" dur="4.261">extractive world as much and maybe</text><text start="6100.619" dur="3.421">prototyping something maybe creating</text><text start="6102.42" dur="3.299">some local resilience and prototyping</text><text start="6104.04" dur="3.78">something that would help prevent some</text><text start="6105.719" dur="4.161">of the cascading failures I don&apos;t want</text><text start="6107.82" dur="4.5">to decrease people&apos;s</text><text start="6109.88" dur="3.819">motivation to do that I think that if</text><text start="6112.32" dur="3.54">people are feeling motivated in that way</text><text start="6113.699" dur="5.881">that is important and awesome and all</text><text start="6115.86" dur="6.18">you know I would say is that like going</text><text start="6119.58" dur="3.72">from no agency to some agency even if</text><text start="6122.04" dur="2.88">it&apos;s just the agency to make your own</text><text start="6123.3" dur="3.3">life better is the movement in the right</text><text start="6124.92" dur="3.66">direction and going from</text><text start="6126.6" dur="3.72">the agency to make your own life better</text><text start="6128.58" dur="3.84">to your family&apos;s life better and then</text><text start="6130.32" dur="4.02">maybe a local community is better is a</text><text start="6132.42" dur="4.259">movement in the right direction and to</text><text start="6134.34" dur="6.299">just keep that direction going as much</text><text start="6136.679" dur="6.361">as you can realizing that</text><text start="6140.639" dur="4.861">even if you stop getting most of your</text><text start="6143.04" dur="4.26">needs your food and whatever met by</text><text start="6145.5" dur="4.26">Global Supply chains you are still part</text><text start="6147.3" dur="4.02">of a world that independent of even</text><text start="6149.76" dur="2.82">caring for the other people and animals</text><text start="6151.32" dur="3.06">in other parts of the world which you</text><text start="6152.58" dur="3.72">probably do you&apos;re also directly</text><text start="6154.38" dur="4.08">affected by them or indirectly but</text><text start="6156.3" dur="6.18">really affected by them</text><text start="6158.46" dur="6.239">and to not get dysfunctionally bummed by</text><text start="6162.48" dur="4.92">what you can&apos;t do about it but to care</text><text start="6164.699" dur="7.081">about it in ways that can motivate new</text><text start="6167.4" dur="8.88">insights and even if let&apos;s say you moved</text><text start="6171.78" dur="6.839">to get to produce a lot less waste and</text><text start="6176.28" dur="5.1">have much deeper better relationships</text><text start="6178.619" dur="5.941">with your neighbors and you know produce</text><text start="6181.38" dur="5.04">much more of your own food and you start</text><text start="6184.56" dur="3.48">to realize that you can extend this to</text><text start="6186.42" dur="2.699">your larger Community than just a few</text><text start="6188.04" dur="3.78">neighbors and you actually create some</text><text start="6189.119" dur="5.1">local resilience the step from that to</text><text start="6191.82" dur="4.14">then mapping what were the things you</text><text start="6194.219" dur="3.181">thought would work that didn&apos;t and what</text><text start="6195.96" dur="4.08">were the things that surprised you that</text><text start="6197.4" dur="4.259">really worked well and putting that</text><text start="6200.04" dur="4.74">online so that other people that are</text><text start="6201.659" dur="4.861">inspired to do similarly can everyone</text><text start="6204.78" dur="4.439">can be benefiting from what everybody</text><text start="6206.52" dur="4.5">learns and staying apprised of the macro</text><text start="6209.219" dur="3.541">issues enough that where you would have</text><text start="6211.02" dur="4.74">the ability to do something meaningful</text><text start="6212.76" dur="4.14">you can that&apos;s really all I would add to</text><text start="6215.76" dur="3.419">that Focus</text><text start="6216.9" dur="4.259">yeah and that&apos;s and that&apos;s really for me</text><text start="6219.179" dur="4.741">at least that&apos;s kind of the ex part of</text><text start="6221.159" dur="6.56">the explicit project is this idea of</text><text start="6223.92" dur="7.68">Cosmo local uh diffusion of innovation</text><text start="6227.719" dur="7.42">and mutual Aid and knowledge sharing you</text><text start="6231.6" dur="6.119">know across scales in physically you</text><text start="6235.139" dur="5.701">know at a bioregional scale but uh</text><text start="6237.719" dur="5.94">mimetically uh at much larger scales and</text><text start="6240.84" dur="4.859">so yeah I think that&apos;s great advice</text><text start="6243.659" dur="4.321">um and I think that&apos;s that&apos;s definitely</text><text start="6245.699" dur="6.721">the direction that you know I&apos;m trying</text><text start="6247.98" dur="7.02">to help help got it good love it yeah</text><text start="6252.42" dur="4.5">um I I apologize I&apos;m gonna have to move</text><text start="6255.0" dur="5.46">us towards rapping I&apos;ve just gotta um</text><text start="6256.92" dur="5.46">get the kiddos in in bed

dur="6.9">as a householder yeah and I&apos;m um I&apos;m</text><text start="6269.699" dur="3.96">amped that this first thread I mean I</text><text start="6272.46" dur="3.719">think we went a lot of different places</text><text start="6273.659" dur="6.261">but that for my instinct that that</text><text start="6276.179" dur="8.161">conversation and sort of like around</text><text start="6279.92" dur="6.88">embedding our instincts around the</text><text start="6284.34" dur="4.859">Aesthetics and ethics of local action</text><text start="6286.8" dur="4.08">and you know the the importance of</text><text start="6289.199" dur="4.801">relearning you know all of that stuff</text><text start="6290.88" dur="5.16">but also getting that living edge with</text><text start="6294.0" dur="5.159">the global coordination coordination</text><text start="6296.04" dur="5.699">issues and the sometimes mind-blowing</text><text start="6299.159" dur="4.861">both ethical and</text><text start="6301.739" dur="4.5">um technological quandaries that we&apos;re</text><text start="6304.02" dur="4.5">facing and just like it&apos;s a very rich</text><text start="6306.239" dur="5.4">tension and I really feel like holding</text><text start="6308.52" dur="5.88">that tension and allowing that to guide</text><text start="6311.639" dur="4.621">our creative agency and the questions</text><text start="6314.4" dur="4.14">that we&apos;re asking is just really really</text><text start="6316.26" dur="4.859">fruitful so I&apos;m super grateful for both</text><text start="6318.54" dur="4.199">of
