<transcript><text start="2.34" dur="4.0">[Music]</text><text start="8.12" dur="4.28">I'll admit I'm a little nervous um you</text><text start="10.96" dur="3.719">know sometimes when you're in the</text><text start="12.4" dur="5.28">presence of like highly intelligent</text><text start="14.679" dur="6.241">people you start to like you feel a</text><text start="17.68" dur="4.28">little dumb thank you so much for that</text><text start="20.92" dur="2.56">even though I know I'm also an</text><text start="21.96" dur="3.239">intelligent person and still you get</text><text start="23.48" dur="3.76">that little bit of an ego trip so thank</text><text start="25.199" dur="4.281">you I think everybody here probably</text><text start="27.24" dur="3.64">knows that Sarah runs pretty much the</text><text start="29.48" dur="3.48">whole programming and the whole</text><text start="30.88" dur="5.08">curriculum and so it's a huge honor that</text><text start="32.96" dur="6.24">you did the dialogue with me directly</text><text start="35.96" dur="6.36">thank you yeah you know I I really love</text><text start="39.2" dur="4.76">um being afraid actually maybe it's</text><text start="42.32" dur="4.759">because I'm a Pisces maybe it's I'm a</text><text start="43.96" dur="6.279">little emo um but I think that when we</text><text start="47.079" dur="5.8">push ourselves to small micro does of</text><text start="50.239" dur="6.361">fear uh which we call in permaculture</text><text start="52.879" dur="5.561">The Edge we talk about that a lot um is</text><text start="56.6" dur="3.599">this is where we actually grow and this</text><text start="58.44" dur="5.439">is where we adapt and this is where we</text><text start="60.199" dur="6.001">learn to be resilient and we realize</text><text start="63.879" dur="4.041">what some of our our limits are as well</text><text start="66.2" dur="3.12">as what some of our strengths are so</text><text start="67.92" dur="4.68">thank you for helping to cultivate that</text><text start="69.32" dur="6.439">and myself um on the</text><text start="72.6" dur="4.76">topic uh I have a really hard time</text><text start="75.759" dur="4.521">actually focusing when there's ambient</text><text start="77.36" dur="5.24">noise so we will struggle with related</text><text start="80.28" dur="4.08">things together yeah that's good that's</text><text start="82.6" dur="3.159">good in our awkwardness we present</text><text start="84.36" dur="5.56">ourselves to</text><text start="85.759" dur="5.481">you um so the title of this talk is an</text><text start="89.92" dur="4.08">interesting one and we'll we'll see</text><text start="91.24" dur="5.32">where we go we have a lot of talking</text><text start="94.0" dur="5.079">points but we also wanted to just</text><text start="96.56" dur="5.04">dialogue because that really is so much</text><text start="99.079" dur="6.441">of the gift of our humanity is this</text><text start="101.6" dur="7.6">ability to communicate to abstract</text><text start="105.52" dur="5.32">Concepts and to share in in the moment</text><text start="109.2" dur="4.08">in the beautiful present moment the</text><text start="110.84" dur="4.76">title of this talk was thoughts on</text><text start="113.28" dur="4.4">psychological orientation to a world in</text><text start="115.6" dur="4.799">meta crisis right we we gave it this</text><text start="117.68" dur="7.039">really headyy title right</text><text start="120.399" dur="7.441">um and it is a very important topic when</text><text start="124.719" dur="4.6">we think about our our metac crisis that</text><text start="127.84" dur="4.32">we're having but we can't even really</text><text start="129.319" dur="5.321">fully understand what metac crisis means</text><text start="132.16" dur="3.92">until we Define more and more of what's</text><text start="134.64" dur="3.36">happening in the world and what you were</text><text start="136.08" dur="3.879">saying is like we don't want to reduce</text><text start="138.0" dur="3.879">things right like I'm an herbalist I'm a</text><text start="139.959" dur="4.881">permaculture it's like reductionist</text><text start="141.879" dur="4.921">thinking um is useful right like we see</text><text start="144.84" dur="4.039">that as a tool it's a tool of modern</text><text start="146.8" dur="3.719">science and modern you know</text><text start="148.879" dur="5.281">philosophical belief belie we also know</text><text start="150.519" dur="6.761">how dangerous reductionism is um but</text><text start="154.16" dur="5.28">we're holistic thinkers right we really</text><text start="157.28" dur="3.879">see that there's this big picture out</text><text start="159.44" dur="4.04">there that there's everything is</text><text start="161.159" dur="4.561">interconnected like I said we aren't we</text><text start="163.48" dur="4.399">aren't anything without all of you and</text><text start="165.72" dur="4.159">in many ways your experience isn't</text><text start="167.879" dur="4.921">anything without us and all of you</text><text start="169.879" dur="5.64">together and so in that interconnection</text><text start="172.8" dur="5.159">thinking about meta crisis I feel like</text><text start="175.519" dur="4.601">we do have to start to weed through and</text><text start="177.959" dur="5.441">reduce a little bit in how we even</text><text start="180.12" dur="5.36">create definitions for what things like</text><text start="183.4" dur="3.919">meta means or what crisis means and when</text><text start="185.48" dur="4.039">I was reading about you you know you're</text><text start="187.319" dur="5.48">talking about you being a</text><text start="189.519" dur="7.841">civilization designer which is a heavy</text><text start="192.799" dur="6.72">load to carry and what when we think</text><text start="197.36" dur="6.519">about designing a civilization I'm</text><text start="199.519" dur="6.041">thinking of Millennia of influence that</text><text start="203.879" dur="3.961">we have in the world and that we're</text><text start="205.56" dur="4.44">participating in the world and so what</text><text start="207.84" dur="5.24">does even civilization if we could start</text><text start="210.0" dur="4.92">to weed through that as we're creating</text><text start="213.08" dur="4.84">the new world anyone out here use the</text><text start="214.92" dur="5.239">new world Paradigm in your vernacular</text><text start="217.92" dur="6.239">you can do a straight elbow I know you</text><text start="220.159" dur="6.601">do right so what does it mean to even</text><text start="224.159" dur="2.601">think about</text><text start="227.68" dur="4.24">civilization there's so many things that</text><text start="229.599" dur="5.36">you said that I kind of want to address</text><text start="231.92" dur="5.8">like um I actually really rigorously</text><text start="234.959" dur="5.801">avoid using terms like Civilization</text><text start="237.72" dur="5.12">designer uh I'll say it's a your bio it</text><text start="240.76" dur="4.44">says it's a topic I'm interested in</text><text start="242.84" dur="5.239">that's a distinction uh I don't think</text><text start="245.2" dur="5.0">anyone can do civilization design but I</text><text start="248.079" dur="6.121">think thinking</text><text start="250.2" dur="5.92">through what viable civilizational</text><text start="254.2" dur="3.879">structures would be is an important</text><text start="256.12" dur="6.76">thing to do while also recognizing the</text><text start="258.079" dur="4.801">limits of our capacity to do it I</text><text start="263.04" dur="4.96">think so there's a problem with the term</text><text start="265.56" dur="4.4">civilization I'll I'll speak to that but</text><text start="268.0" dur="3.6">first there's a problem with terms right</text><text start="269.96" dur="7.16">as you were speaking about reductionism</text><text start="271.6" dur="8.52">and words so when Lau thought of what he</text><text start="277.12" dur="4.56">would start the da a jing with the first</text><text start="280.12" dur="3.28">thing to say was the da that is</text><text start="281.68" dur="6.0">speakable is not the Eternal</text><text start="283.4" dur="5.96">da and I wrote a poem a few years ago</text><text start="287.68" dur="4.92">called the dance of the da and the</text><text start="289.36" dur="6.04">10,000 things and it it asks like is an</text><text start="292.6" dur="4.48">adom real and it's like kind of like</text><text start="295.4" dur="4.76">kind of an Adam is real the way we</text><text start="297.08" dur="6.16">Define it and very pragmatic atically we</text><text start="300.16" dur="5.319">can do a lot of chemistry very reliably</text><text start="303.24" dur="5.16">but when we Define the</text><text start="305.479" dur="6.201">atom we don't include in the definition</text><text start="308.4" dur="5.639">of the atom the electromagnetic field</text><text start="311.68" dur="3.68">without which it wouldn't exist or the</text><text start="314.039" dur="3.44">strong force without which it wouldn't</text><text start="315.36" dur="4.8">exist or the higs field without which it</text><text start="317.479" dur="6.0">wouldn't exist or the star that</text><text start="320.16" dur="5.84">Supernova to make it so the atom</text><text start="323.479" dur="4.361">definition takes for granted a whole</text><text start="326.0" dur="4.4">universe of reality without which it</text><text start="327.84" dur="3.479">wouldn't exist right and so this is true</text><text start="330.4" dur="4.44">for every</text><text start="331.319" dur="6.041">word and so concepts are useful and</text><text start="334.84" dur="5.28">there is error embedded in everyone all</text><text start="337.36" dur="6.16">the way down to error embedded in every</text><text start="340.12" dur="7.079">word and this is actually pretty</text><text start="343.52" dur="5.76">critical to the metac crisis because I</text><text start="347.199" dur="4.28">think everybody here knows that both</text><text start="349.28" dur="4.4">climate change is both a really big deal</text><text start="351.479" dur="4.961">and carbon reductionism is a problem</text><text start="353.68" dur="5.239">it's possible to over focus on how we</text><text start="356.44" dur="4.24">reduce carbon in ways that underfocus on</text><text start="358.919" dur="4.761">biodiversity it and dead zones and</text><text start="360.68" dur="4.44">oceans and nitrogen run off and a lot of</text><text start="363.68" dur="3.6">other</text><text start="365.12" dur="5.96">things but it's not just carbon right</text><text start="367.28" dur="5.8">it's any metric if we talk about number</text><text start="371.08" dur="6.28">of trees planted like the concept of a</text><text start="373.08" dur="8.32">tree is a problem because of 2,000 year</text><text start="377.36" dur="5.8">old tree and 100y old tree and trees</text><text start="381.4" dur="4.639">that have totally different genetics</text><text start="383.16" dur="4.2">like all of that's lost as soon as you</text><text start="386.039" dur="3.041">make a concept that you can make a</text><text start="387.36" dur="4.64">metric about that you can do large scale</text><text start="389.08" dur="5.16">optimis a of but to do large scale you</text><text start="392.0" dur="4.12">can't include all the Nuance so inherent</text><text start="394.24" dur="5.12">to being able to scale is the reduction</text><text start="396.12" dur="6.68">of information is the externalities</text><text start="399.36" dur="5.72">Associated so when you think about the</text><text start="402.8" dur="5.2">thou sh create no graven images and no</text><text start="405.08" dur="6.519">false Idols the way I think about that</text><text start="408.0" dur="5.72">is that models of reality are false</text><text start="411.599" dur="5.241">Idols if you take them to be</text><text start="413.72" dur="5.919">reality right any any model of human</text><text start="416.84" dur="4.359">psychology of how ecosystems work work</text><text start="419.639" dur="4.761">of fundamental</text><text start="421.199" dur="5.481">physics uh has some utility to it but is</text><text start="424.4" dur="4.04">not true with a capital T and to the</text><text start="426.68" dur="3.6">degree that we get over excited about it</text><text start="428.44" dur="3.439">make it true of the capital T where the</text><text start="430.28" dur="4.24">model of reality is different than</text><text start="431.879" dur="4.88">reality if we optimize for that model is</text><text start="434.52" dur="4.359">where we end up harming reality so there</text><text start="436.759" dur="4.56">needs to be some capacity to perceive</text><text start="438.879" dur="6.281">reality not through the lens of what we</text><text start="441.319" dur="7.361">already know as important right IM</text><text start="445.16" dur="6.039">immediate or non-mediated direct sensing</text><text start="448.68" dur="4.56">of what's out of conceptual Frameworks</text><text start="451.199" dur="6.0">right and when we talk about things like</text><text start="453.24" dur="7.639">the error in the word right the word</text><text start="457.199" dur="5.321">becomes the pure Truth at some points</text><text start="460.879" dur="4.16">and what we do is with the word is we</text><text start="462.52" dur="5.84">create an identity around that word and</text><text start="465.039" dur="5.88">then the framework of that identity</text><text start="468.36" dur="4.64">loses its permeability right it's</text><text start="470.919" dur="4.801">something like akin to a geopolitical</text><text start="473.0" dur="4.72">border like uh I'm Sarah or you're</text><text start="475.72" dur="3.84">Daniel or this is en Vision festival and</text><text start="477.72" dur="4.439">we do see there's some type of a order</text><text start="479.56" dur="4.28">and we see my skin and we see your skin</text><text start="482.159" dur="3.88">but what we know is that there's this</text><text start="483.84" dur="4.44">huge energetic exchange there's a</text><text start="486.039" dur="5.041">microbiome flying all around us there's</text><text start="488.28" dur="5.4">electromagnetic field all these things</text><text start="491.08" dur="4.92">right that's moving in between us and so</text><text start="493.68" dur="5.0">the word being so powerful the word</text><text start="496.0" dur="5.96">being spells that we're creating that we</text><text start="498.68" dur="5.199">become so stuck on is actually so</text><text start="501.96" dur="4.639">dangerous and it's one of I feel our</text><text start="503.879" dur="5.081">Gifts of our human reality is that we're</text><text start="506.599" dur="5.401">able to do this you know and it's also</text><text start="508.96" dur="3.04">our our largest</text><text start="513.959" dur="4.161">limitation yeah it's where you want to</text><text start="516.519" dur="5.041">think about the</text><text start="518.12" dur="5.479">models in terms of their usefulness you</text><text start="521.56" dur="4.56">want to run lots of different models</text><text start="523.599" dur="4.881">that seem to emphasize different things</text><text start="526.12" dur="3.92">maybe even conflict with each other and</text><text start="528.48" dur="3.72">you want to hold them all with some</text><text start="530.04" dur="5.359">lightness and you want to hold in terms</text><text start="532.2" dur="6.0">of the no false Idols you want to hold</text><text start="535.399" dur="6.56">your relationship to what is sacred as</text><text start="538.2" dur="4.759">fundamentally UNM modelable unmeasurable</text><text start="541.959" dur="3.761">non</text><text start="542.959" dur="4.801">optimizable so a corollary of the Dow</text><text start="545.72" dur="4.239">that is speakable is not the Eternal Dow</text><text start="547.76" dur="4.72">is the metric set that is optimizable is</text><text start="549.959" dur="4.681">not the right metric set which is the</text><text start="552.48" dur="4.96">core issue with AI and AI alignment</text><text start="554.64" dur="6.08">which is now probably the fastest</text><text start="557.44" dur="7.04">emerging issue that the world faces</text><text start="560.72" dur="5.559">is the issue of a gii alignment</text><text start="564.48" dur="3.799">generalized artificial intelligence is</text><text start="566.279" dur="4.68">is it if there's something that can</text><text start="568.279" dur="4.321">optimize for a goal set very very</text><text start="570.959" dur="4.201">powerfully very</text><text start="572.6" dur="5.12">rapidly so rapidly and powerfully that</text><text start="575.16" dur="4.359">once it's doing that we can't change it</text><text start="577.72" dur="3.559">is there any goal set that you can give</text><text start="579.519" dur="3.681">it that is</text><text start="581.279" dur="3.56">good</text><text start="583.2" dur="4.759">and</text><text start="584.839" dur="6.721">the it's a complex topic but I would say</text><text start="587.959" dur="6.32">simply the answer is no right there's no</text><text start="591.56" dur="4.399">finitely describable computable goal set</text><text start="594.279" dur="3.081">that you would want to optimize</text><text start="595.959" dur="4.921">infinitely</text><text start="597.36" dur="6.159">because and we see this with the the the</text><text start="600.88" dur="5.56">good measure of a life is GDP well</text><text start="603.519" dur="5.601">obviously GDP is not a good measure of</text><text start="606.44" dur="4.399">reality because it can go up from war</text><text start="609.12" dur="3.68">and addiction and sickness and lots of</text><text start="610.839" dur="5.321">things like that so then you say well</text><text start="612.8" dur="4.8">GDP plus a genie coefficient plus carbon</text><text start="616.16" dur="4.4">and that still doesn't include</text><text start="617.6" dur="5.12">biodiversity and so you add more metrics</text><text start="620.56" dur="5.399">there will always be some stuff that is</text><text start="622.72" dur="5.16">in the real particularly in the unknown</text><text start="625.959" dur="4.041">unknown set that is not in the metric</text><text start="627.88" dur="5.519">set that is being optimized for this is</text><text start="630.0" dur="5.36">true for AI it's also true for markets</text><text start="633.399" dur="5.521">it's also true for any kind of</text><text start="635.36" dur="5.76">optimization process so I don't want to</text><text start="638.92" dur="5.0">infinitely optimize any finitely</text><text start="641.12" dur="5.04">described thing which is why we want</text><text start="643.92" dur="3.479">some relationship to reality that is</text><text start="646.16" dur="3.799">outside of</text><text start="647.399" dur="5.041">description and we and ultimately the</text><text start="649.959" dur="5.721">sacred is bound to a direct

dur="4.52">image comes in of Looking Through The</text><text start="660.6" dur="5.32">Eyes of a child you know and how that</text><text start="663.12" dur="6.36">little one is constantly asking why and</text><text start="665.92" dur="6.32">why but why but why and if you've ever</text><text start="669.48" dur="4.64">experienced that with young ones or even</text><text start="672.24" dur="4.32">of ourselves you know we stop asking we</text><text start="674.12" dur="4.12">want to ask why and then we feel we have</text><text start="676.56" dur="3.04">to keep finding the answers find the</text><text start="678.24" dur="3.399">answer find the answer but when they're</text><text start="679.6" dur="3.76">the little ones and they keep taking us</text><text start="681.639" dur="4.401">down that hole they challenge us to</text><text start="683.36" dur="4.719">remember that we we can actually know</text><text start="686.04" dur="4.08">everything right there and so to create</text><text start="688.079" dur="6.0">attempt to create metrics for everything</text><text start="690.12" dur="8.08">is kind of pushing Beyond maybe what</text><text start="694.079" dur="6.641">is the the sacred mystery of our reality</text><text start="698.2" dur="5.92">you know and trying to metric everything</text><text start="700.72" dur="6.52">and optimizing everything is inherently</text><text start="704.12" dur="5.0">um an exploitive capitalistic model</text><text start="707.24" dur="5.76">right which is going in many ways which</text><text start="709.12"

start="874.519" dur="5.521">that one thing I was thinking is you</text><text start="877.24" dur="5.12">just said um inherent to</text><text start="880.04" dur="4.479">the that that kind of

start="914.36" dur="4.88">intent this is a thing that I would like</text><text start="916.8" dur="7.68">to address</text><text start="919.24" dur="7.2">is it's fundamentally easier to solve a</text><text start="924.48" dur="3.599">problem than it is to ensure that your</text><text start="926.44" dur="3.319">solution to that problem doesn't cause</text><text start="928.079" dur="4.281">other problems</text><text start="929.759" dur="4.44">it's easier in kind not just</text><text start="932.36" dur="4.2">motivationally but epistemologically</text><text start="934.199" dur="4.921">thought wise cuz if I'm defining my</text><text start="936.56" dur="4.92">problem like whatever it is I want to</text><text start="939.12" dur="3.76">bring CO2 down or I want to help the

start="952.639" dur="3.521">that problem as</text><text start="954.079" dur="4.56">defined and so I'm trying to create a</text><text start="956.16" dur="5.72">first order effect on a small

dur="4.88">or the whatever it is but because</text><text start="967.0" dur="5.04">whatever I create is going to interact</text><text start="968.88" dur="4.92">with social systems and ecologies and</text><text start="972.04" dur="3.08">economies that are complex it's going to</text><text start="973.8" dur="2.8">have effect on other things it's going</text><text start="975.12" dur="5.68">to

just build the</text><text start="992.0" dur="5.04">thing is first order effects on a small</text><text start="994.12" dur="5.0">number of things so it is there's an</text><text start="997.04" dur="5.56">asymmetry it's radically</text><text start="999.12" dur="5.719">easier to solve narrowly defined</text><text start="1002.6" dur="3.56">problems than to define the problem well</text><text start="1004.839" dur="3.161">enough and come up with a solution that</text><text start="1006.16" dur="5.0">doesn't do that there's also an</text><text start="1008.0" dur="5.759">asymmetry in the game theory that those</text><text start="1011.16" dur="5.84">who focus on the opportunity more and</text><text start="1013.759" dur="5.32">the risk less get first mover advantage</text><text start="1017.0" dur="3.56">and get capital and get power and then</text><text start="1019.079" dur="3.281">when the problems happen they say we</text><text start="1020.56" dur="4.119">couldn't have

dur="6.28">intent we create different types of it</text><text start="1092.12" dur="3.559">was a word that our friend elor the</text><text start="1094.0" dur="4.2">other day in his talk used it is we</text><text start="1095.679" dur="4.961">create aliis for our good intent which I</text><text start="1098.2" dur="6.08">thought was really a profound thing to</text><text start="1100.64" dur="6.64">to acknowledge and in our good intent</text><text start="1104.28" dur="4.68">and starting on the scales that feel</text><text start="1107.28" dur="5.32">attainable to us you because you're such</text><text start="1108.96" dur="6.48">a a macro thinker but for many of us in</text><text start="1112.6" dur="5.04">audience it's really difficult to see</text><text start="1115.44" dur="5.32">things from the macro scale because</text><text start="1117.64" dur="4.72">we're so wrapped up in our own worlds</text><text start="1120.76" dur="4.799">sometimes that like looking outside of</text><text start="1122.36" dur="6.04">ourselves it's like so heavy you know or</text><text start="1125.559" dur="4.641">if we start to inform ourselves about</text><text start="1128.4" dur="5.12">what's happening to other people around</text><text start="1130.2" dur="5.16">the world it's devastating on the soul</text><text start="1133.52" dur="4.36">level you know when we look at</text><text start="1135.36" dur="3.72">situations like in Iran for example</text><text start="1137.88" dur="3.24">that's what feel feels most passionate</text><text start="1139.08" dur="3.92">to me right now is the female movement</text><text start="1141.12" dur="4.88">there that's happening you know and I</text><text start="1143.0" dur="6.039">feel powerless to it but where I do feel</text><text start="1146.0" dur="7.4">power powerful is in situations like</text><text start="1149.039" dur="9.241">this where I feel powerful is in those</text><text start="1153.4"

we talk</text><text start="1163.12" dur="5.76">about things like consensus and it's</text><text start="1166.52" dur="4.279">hard it's really hard it's hours and</text><text start="1168.88" dur="4.56">hours and hours and hours and days and</text><text start="1170.799" dur="5.201">days and days of processing to finally</text><text start="1173.44" dur="5.4">say that we all agree on if it should be</text><text start="1176.0" dur="5.44">pizza or pasta right like the simple</text><text start="1178.84" dur="5.44">things we'll sit there and debate about</text><text start="1181.44" dur="5.84">as as human beings because our consensus</text><text start="1184.28" dur="6.879">is so often rooted in personal opinion</text><text start="1187.28" dur="6.879">is that how do we then if we if we can't</text><text start="1191.159" dur="5.161">scale consensus what we're inherently</text><text start="1194.159" dur="4.601">seeing is that what is scalable are</text><text start="1196.32" dur="4.52">things that are punitive in nature like</text><text start="1198.76" dur="4.56">punishable by nature and that so then</text><text start="1200.84" dur="4.319">we're operating in fear-based

political power</text><text start="1747.399" dur="4.16">in the situation so it's actually this</text><text start="1749.96" dur="4.16">the important thing is one has to lean</text><text

that</text><text start="1779.84" dur="4.559">twitch of I want to look I want to look</text><text start="1782.399" dur="3.681">what's happening you know or the moments</text><text start="1784.399" dur="3.64">when you're in the forest and being</text><text start="1786.08" dur="3.52">silent and sitting and you feel</text><text start="1788.039" dur="3.721">uncomfortable with the life that's</text><text start="1789.6" dur="4.199">around you and all the things that you</text><text start="1791.76" dur="3.48">feel like you have to do that are</text><text start="1793.799" dur="3.6">important in your world and then when</text><text start="1795.24" dur="4.72">you really start to sit there is when</text><text start="1797.399" dur="4.241">when and ease and lean into the</text><text start="1799.96" dur="3.839">uncomfortableness is when you start to</text><text start="1801.64" dur="4.36">see all the life around you I just got</text><text start="1803.799" dur="2.201">really</text><text start="1806.2" dur="4.839">loud you start to see all that life</text><text start="1808.519" dur="6.241">around you and you start to feel so</text><text start="1811.039" dur="6.76">deeply interconnected with it all and</text><text start="1814.76" dur="5.279">seeing that your life in some ways is</text><text start="1817.799" dur="5.72">everything and nothing at</text><text start="1820.039" dur="4.76">once yeah so you take the you were</text><text start="1823.519" dur="2.361">mentioning the relationship between</text><text start="1824.799" dur="4.0">Despair and</text><text start="1825.88" dur="7.32">apathy and despair is way better than</text><text start="1828.799" dur="7.36">apathy apathy is</text><text start="1833.2" dur="5.24">um an escape from pain that you don't</text><text start="1836.159" dur="6.041">feel like you can deal with through</text><text start="1838.44" dur="5.64">agency right so if I'm if I'm feeling</text><text start="1842.2" dur="4.12">despair it's because something I care</text><text start="1844.08" dur="4.16">about is being harmed and I'm feeling</text><text start="1846.32" dur="4.719">that but underneath it the source of it</text><text start="1848.24" dur="5.039">is care right if I didn't love or care</text><text start="1851.039" dur="4.681">about if you didn't love those women if</text><text start="1853.279" dur="3.681">you didn't care about their if you</text><text start="1855.72" dur="2.88">didn't find something sacred and</text><text start="1856.96" dur="3.439">beautiful beautiful about their life you</text><text start="1858.6" dur="3.919">wouldn't give any shits about it right</text><text start="1860.399" dur="4.041">so the despair is actually an expression</text><text start="1862.519" dur="4.64">of what you find beautiful meaningful</text><text start="1864.44" dur="4.239">sacred and that you love it's what the</text><text start="1867.159" dur="2.961">fear is about too right the fear and</text><text start="1868.679" dur="3.72">anxiety is about that things that you</text><text start="1870.12" dur="3.679">find Sacred will be harmed the anger is</text><text start="1872.399" dur="3.0">also about the same thing it's that</text><text start="1873.799" dur="3.441">something that you find Sacred beautiful</text><text start="1875.399" dur="3.441">meaningful is being harmed and you're</text><text start="1877.24" dur="4.64">looking at who's doing</text><text start="1878.84" dur="4.959">it so if you trace all those emotions</text><text start="1881.88" dur="4.639">back to their source is what is actually</text><text start="1883.799" dur="4.72">sacred to me that I want to be in</text><text start="1886.519" dur="3.441">service to</text><text start="1888.519" dur="3.88">and then you realize if the despair</text><text start="1889.96" dur="4.4">shuts my agency down it's actually not</text><text start="1892.399" dur="5.561">an ethical thing I can</text><text start="1894.36" dur="8.08">indulge cuz this Love Actually requires</text><text start="1897.96" dur="6.16">me to be as effective as I can be and so</text><text start="1902.44" dur="3.44">I find that there's a transformation if</text><text start="1904.12" dur="3.72">I take what I'm afraid of and I trace it</text><text start="1905.88" dur="4.2">back to what is it that I care about</text><text start="1907.84" dur="4.4">that I don't want to have be harmed and</text><text start="1910.08" dur="4.4">I really tune into the sacredness there</text><text start="1912.24" dur="5.36">and then I say how can I be most in</text><text start="1914.48" dur="5.199">service I get like I it's something</text><text start="1917.6" dur="5.4">that's more like careful than</text><text start="1919.679" dur="5.761">fearful the anger turns into like</text><text start="1923.0" dur="6.679">impassioned action the despair turns</text><text start="1925.44" dur="6.64">into both grief and awe and motivation</text><text start="1929.679" dur="4.281">and the apathy is actually even we can</text><text start="1932.08" dur="4.36">empathize with it in ourself and others</text><text start="1933.96" dur="5.0">it's an overwhelm at pain that we don't</text><text start="1936.44" dur="5.56">know how to deal with but the answer is</text><text start="1938.96" dur="4.839">actually more figuring out how to have</text><text start="1942.0" dur="4.32">agency more so we can stay with the</text><text start="1943.799" dur="4.561">feelings rather than turn them off and I</text><text start="1946.32" dur="3.88">feel like some of the agency is actually</text><text start="1948.36" dur="5.679">the choice and how we work with our</text><text start="1950.2" dur="6.56">feelings and how we let them sometimes</text><text start="1954.039" dur="5.76">cause ourselves harm cause others harm</text><text start="1956.76" dur="5.799">based on how we feel and so that first</text><text start="1959.799" dur="5.041">step in agency is acknowledging the</text><text start="1962.559" dur="4.08">feelings that we're having processing</text><text start="1964.84" dur="5.48">through them and what also comes up for</text><text start="1966.639" dur="6.201">me which was such a profound um Moment</text><text start="1970.32" dur="4.44">In My Reality coming from like that</text><text start="1972.84" dur="3.679">Catholic wounding which I bet a lot of</text><text start="1974.76" dur="4.12">you have out there right and</text><text start="1976.519" dur="7.361">acknowledging things like witch wound</text><text start="1978.88" dur="8.399">and um stepping into you know personal</text><text start="1983.88" dur="6.48">power embodied power and agency was</text><text start="1987.279" dur="5.441">realizing that holy places aren't places</text><text start="1990.36" dur="4.72">with identities and they aren't places</text><text start="1992.72" dur="4.64">that are held by the few but it's</text><text start="1995.08" dur="3.839">actually in every single step we take</text><text start="1997.36" dur="4.199">and that the Holy Ground is right</text><text start="1998.919" dur="4.441">beneath your feet right now everywhere</text><text start="2001.559" dur="6.6">that we're we're moving through the</text><text start="2003.36" dur="7.199">world and in you know that Holy</text><text start="2008.159" dur="5.12">of the ground and that Holy step it's</text><text start="2010.559" dur="4.36">reminding us that that is sacred to me</text><text start="2013.279" dur="4.36">and that everything in life is sacred to</text><text start="2014.919" dur="4.441">me so it's like if we can come into that</text><text start="2017.639" dur="5.361">place and this is what I love so much</text><text start="2019.36" dur="6.4">about um modern Witchcraft and that</text><text start="2023.0" dur="5.6">movement is exactly that because
