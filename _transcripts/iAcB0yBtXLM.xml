dur="4.8">probably want to unpack what we even</text><text start="179.28" dur="7.38">mean by spiritual Sunset is a pretty</text><text start="182.64" dur="6.12">um unprecise term often but the the</text><text start="186.66" dur="5.579">psychological</text><text start="188.76" dur="5.28">interior sacred whatever dimensions of</text><text start="192.239" dur="4.321">uh</text><text start="194.04" dur="4.32">the state of our world a</text><text start="196.56" dur="4.86">would love to be in that conversation</text><text start="198.36" dur="4.379">together I don&apos;t have a preset set of</text><text start="201.42" dur="2.64">things to talk about on it because as</text><text start="202.739" dur="4.14">you mentioned it&apos;s not the thing I talk</text><text start="204.06" dur="5.039">about all the time but uh obviously very</text><text start="206.879" dur="4.28">interesting</text><text start="209.099" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="213.14" dur="4.42">I was fortunate in my growing up to get</text><text start="215.94" dur="2.879">to study a lot of the</text><text start="217.56" dur="3.539">people that might be called great</text><text start="218.819" dur="5.401">polymaths throughout history so I have a</text><text start="221.099" dur="5.341">heap of respect for them and I&apos;ve</text><text start="224.22" dur="5.159">tried to learn what I can I</text><text start="226.44" dur="4.68">would not describe myself that way</text><text start="229.379" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="231.12" dur="4.08">I think the connection as I would</text><text start="233.519" dur="4.14">describe myself as</text><text start="235.2" dur="3.48">being deeply interested in lots of</text><text start="237.659" dur="4.561">things</text><text start="238.68" dur="5.339">and I find that what people are</text><text start="242.22" dur="3.299">interested in and what they find</text><text start="244.019" dur="3.241">meaningful</text><text start="245.519" dur="3.601">and at the heart of that what they find</text><text start="247.26" dur="4.32">Sacred are usually connected though they</text><text start="249.12" dur="3.839">might not be explicitly aware</text><text start="251.58" dur="4.14">and the things that people are</text><text start="252.959" dur="6.601">interested in and enough they often</text><text start="255.72" dur="6.62">develop some capacity at and if someone</text><text start="259.56" dur="2.78">has some</text><text start="262.74" dur="4.08">sense of the wholeness of reality as</text><text start="265.199" dur="3.901">opposed to like</text><text start="266.82" dur="5.58">when we think in different disciplines</text><text start="269.1" dur="6.42">here&apos;s where biology starts in chemistry</text><text start="272.4" dur="4.38">stops or physics or whatever</text><text start="275.52" dur="3.239">um I</text><text start="276.78" dur="3.54">those are ways we take the complexity of</text><text start="278.759" dur="3.841">the world and try to divide it to make</text><text start="280.32" dur="4.5">subjects and make it easier to study but</text><text start="282.6" dur="4.14">those divisions don&apos;t exist in reality</text><text start="284.82" dur="3.599">in that way so if</text><text start="286.74" dur="4.14">we have some sense of just the</text><text start="288.419" dur="4.381">integrated wholeness of reality and</text><text start="290.88" dur="4.62">we&apos;re kind of interested in it there&apos;s</text><text start="292.8" dur="4.44">some sense that reality itself is sacred</text><text start="295.5" dur="2.94">then there would be nothing that isn&apos;t</text><text start="297.24" dur="4.08">interesting</text><text start="298.44" dur="4.08">right it&apos;s like if it&apos;s like what if</text><text start="301.32" dur="2.58">you&apos;re really in love with your partner</text><text start="302.52" dur="4.02">what</text><text start="303.9" dur="4.739">aspect of their being is uninteresting</text><text start="306.54" dur="4.32">to you like it&apos;s a weird proposition to</text><text start="308.639" dur="4.381">say item give a what she thinks</text><text start="310.86" dur="4.82">about or like her talk books on fashion</text><text start="313.02" dur="4.98">or whatever it is and it&apos;s such a</text><text start="315.68" dur="3.519">superficial place to be because even if</text><text start="318.0" dur="2.88">you didn&apos;t think you cared about that</text><text start="319.199" dur="3.481">topic on your own</text><text start="320.88" dur="3.84">if you really care about this peeing and</text><text start="322.68" dur="3.299">this being cares about it work to</text><text start="324.72" dur="2.52">understand why they care about it</text><text start="325.979" dur="4.921">because there&apos;s some part of their being</text><text start="327.24" dur="5.1">you&apos;re missing if the fascination they</text><text start="330.9" dur="3.299">have if the care if the love doesn&apos;t</text><text start="332.34" dur="4.799">Translate to</text><text start="334.199" dur="6.0">and so if you get that you&apos;re like well</text><text start="337.139" dur="4.861">whatever every aspect of them I&apos;m</text><text start="340.199" dur="3.84">interested in because part of Love is</text><text start="342.0" dur="3.18">the desire to know because what does it</text><text start="344.039" dur="3.181">mean that I love somebody if I don&apos;t</text><text start="345.18" dur="2.76">really know who they are</text><text start="347.22" dur="5.28">um</text><text start="347.94" dur="6.66">and if I have some love for reality then</text><text start="352.5" dur="3.9">wanting to know it more is one of the</text><text start="354.6" dur="4.2">things right wanting to appreciate it</text><text start="356.4" dur="4.92">more wanting to being more service to it</text><text start="358.8" dur="4.679">and those are all just kind of natural</text><text start="361.32" dur="3.3">byproducts and so</text><text start="363.479" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="364.62" dur="5.76">relatively Young</text><text start="367.259" dur="5.66">I had the Insight that everything was</text><text start="370.38" dur="2.539">interesting</text><text start="373.139" dur="3.421">that the things that I thought weren&apos;t</text><text start="375.36" dur="2.82">interesting because at first I didn&apos;t</text><text start="376.56" dur="3.96">think that but the the things I thought</text><text start="378.18" dur="6.42">weren&apos;t interesting was just because I</text><text start="380.52" dur="7.019">didn&apos;t get them I didn&apos;t understand why</text><text start="384.6" dur="4.62">uh anyone else found it interesting and</text><text start="387.539" dur="2.94">if I tuned in empathetically enough to</text><text start="389.22" dur="2.52">them and I could see it I&apos;m like oh</text><text start="390.479" dur="3.601">there&apos;s a whole dimension of</text><text start="391.74" dur="3.54">meaningfulness and Beauty in parts of</text><text start="394.08" dur="3.08">the nature of reality that I&apos;m just</text><text start="395.28" dur="7.38">missing</text><text start="397.16" dur="7.12">and when jibron said it&apos;s in it was in</text><text start="402.66" dur="2.879">meditation upon the dewdrop that I</text><text start="404.28" dur="3.479">discovered the mysteries of the ocean</text><text start="405.539" dur="4.801">right the kind of poetic way to speak to</text><text start="407.759" dur="4.921">the the fractal nature or the as without</text><text start="410.34" dur="4.38">so then</text><text start="412.68" dur="4.26">when there is some understanding of the</text><text start="414.72" dur="4.62">integratedness of reality a deep insight</text><text start="416.94" dur="5.759">about anything also gives you some</text><text start="419.34" dur="4.56">insight about everything else and uh one</text><text start="422.699" dur="4.701">of the places that I gained the most</text><text start="423.9" dur="5.28">Insight was taking some principle and</text><text start="427.4" dur="4.299">thermodynamics and applying it to</text><text start="429.18" dur="4.26">gardening or some principle in</text><text start="431.699" dur="3.72">evolutionary theory and applying it to</text><text start="433.44" dur="2.819">relationships or whatever getting that</text><text start="435.419" dur="2.521">like</text><text start="436.259" dur="3.541">those theories were ways of</text><text start="437.94" dur="3.36">understanding the universe but all of</text><text start="439.8" dur="3.0">them gave different insights looking at</text><text start="441.3" dur="4.14">the world through thermodynamics lens</text><text start="442.8" dur="4.56">versus an evolutionary cyclins versus a</text><text start="445.44" dur="4.02">complexity Theory lens gave different</text><text start="447.36" dur="3.54">insights on the same reality</text><text start="449.46" dur="2.94">so if I could take those insights and</text><text start="450.9" dur="3.6">apply them to lots of things and apply</text><text start="452.4" dur="4.44">lots of different ones just got to see</text><text start="454.5" dur="3.419">more multi-dimensionally right one of</text><text start="456.84" dur="2.52">the projects we launched called the</text><text start="457.919" dur="4.261">consilience project that&apos;s what the word</text><text start="459.36" dur="5.399">consilience means is the more</text><text start="462.18" dur="4.859">perspectives one can take on a thing the</text><text start="464.759" dur="4.261">more depth and richness of information</text><text start="467.039" dur="3.981">they can get about it</text><text start="469.02" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="471.06" dur="5.46">so and I think you know the The Meta</text><text start="473.94" dur="4.02">crisis this area of study of like</text><text start="476.52" dur="3.6">what are all the problems of the world</text><text start="477.96" dur="5.22">is really like</text><text start="480.12" dur="4.079">came from a childhood inquiry of</text><text start="483.18" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="484.199" dur="3.421">what is worth doing</text><text start="486.3" dur="3.179">and</text><text start="487.62" dur="4.26">uh there were so many things that were</text><text start="489.479" dur="5.581">worth doing and I became I became kind</text><text start="491.88" dur="5.039">of clear that when you focus on one one</text><text start="495.06" dur="2.88">I just couldn&apos;t leave some of the areas</text><text start="496.919" dur="4.201">out</text><text start="497.94" dur="5.039">right like it was just I don&apos;t know how</text><text start="501.12" dur="3.18">many people have this experience some</text><text start="502.979" dur="2.821">for sure</text><text start="504.3" dur="3.239">but when I would think about really</text><text start="505.8" dur="3.78">focusing on factory farms or really</text><text start="507.539" dur="3.241">focusing on</text><text start="509.58" dur="3.6">um</text><text start="510.78" dur="3.78">the issue of how many dogs and cats are</text><text start="513.18" dur="3.84">getting put to sleep every year or clear</text><text start="514.56" dur="4.14">cutting or whatever it was the idea that</text><text start="517.02" dur="4.259">I was not focusing on the other things</text><text start="518.7" dur="4.62">just wrecked me</text><text start="521.279" dur="3.661">and then getting to see that there were</text><text start="523.32" dur="3.48">so many groups focusing on those things</text><text start="524.94" dur="3.839">and yet so many of those things</text><text start="526.8" dur="3.36">collectively were getting worse not</text><text start="528.779" dur="2.881">better and I was wondering do we just</text><text start="530.16" dur="2.94">need more effort in these areas or is</text><text start="531.66" dur="3.84">there something about the nature of the</text><text start="533.1" dur="3.96">effort that is that is</text><text start="535.5" dur="3.48">um off</text><text start="537.06" dur="3.66">and the answer is both but there was</text><text start="538.98" dur="4.08">definitely something about and people</text><text start="540.72" dur="4.14">heard me talk other places the way we</text><text start="543.06" dur="2.94">solve problems causes other problems</text><text start="544.86" dur="2.76">almost all the time because we Define</text><text start="546.0" dur="3.42">the problem too narrowly we create a</text><text start="547.62" dur="3.42">first order Solution that&apos;s a technology</text><text start="549.42" dur="2.7">or a law or a business or whatever to</text><text start="551.04" dur="3.66">solve it</text><text start="552.12" dur="4.14">but that&apos;s connected to a complex set of</text><text start="554.7" dur="4.02">things and it produces second and third</text><text start="556.26" dur="4.199">order effects somewhere else so the dam</text><text start="558.72" dur="3.42">to bring electricity to poor people to</text><text start="560.459" dur="3.601">solve the poverty issue might extinct a</text><text start="562.14" dur="3.9">bunch of species Down River from the dam</text><text start="564.06" dur="3.18">that just got flooded or whatever and</text><text start="566.04" dur="4.44">this</text><text start="567.24" dur="4.98">a million examples of this</text><text start="570.48" dur="5.16">so there&apos;s a</text><text start="572.22" dur="4.98">it actually became clear that the study</text><text start="575.64" dur="3.96">of the</text><text start="577.2" dur="3.78">issues in the world and the siloing of</text><text start="579.6" dur="2.76">the issues in the world was a part of</text><text start="580.98" dur="4.08">the problem itself why we weren&apos;t</text><text start="582.36" dur="5.46">solving them in a way that boehm talked</text><text start="585.06" dur="6.54">about very well David Bohm</text><text start="587.82" dur="6.36">and uh so the like what is worth caring</text><text start="591.6" dur="4.2">about everything and how it fits</text><text start="594.18" dur="4.02">together what is worth studying is kind</text><text start="595.8" dur="4.44">of everything the study is for itself</text><text start="598.2" dur="3.96">it&apos;s pure knowledge of just the intimacy</text><text start="600.24" dur="4.44">with universes intrinsically interesting</text><text start="602.16" dur="4.14">and it&apos;s also has utility it can</text><text start="604.68" dur="3.24">increase the capacity to be of service</text><text start="606.3" dur="2.4">to</text><text start="607.92" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="608.7" dur="5.94">those are some initial thoughts</text><text start="611.22" dur="6.299">but Daniel did you was there a point as</text><text start="614.64" dur="4.8">a young man or a teenager you begin as</text><text start="617.519" dur="3.781">you were kind of chewing on all this and</text><text start="619.44" dur="4.74">seeing it was that starting to emerge as</text><text start="621.3" dur="5.46">a calling for you that maybe that was</text><text start="624.18" dur="4.68">your uh path to start connecting the</text><text start="626.76" dur="4.639">dots and seeing how these things uh</text><text start="628.86" dur="2.539">mattered</text><text start="631.74" dur="2.779">I think</text><text start="639.54" dur="4.26">I think most people when they&apos;re young</text><text start="641.58" dur="5.699">are enculturated in a particular way</text><text start="643.8" dur="5.76">about who they are and what life is</text><text start="647.279" dur="4.141">about and what they should pursue</text><text start="649.56" dur="4.14">and then some of them continue on that</text><text start="651.42" dur="4.44">path some of them recognize that their</text><text start="653.7" dur="4.68">parents idea of what their calling</text><text start="655.86" dur="3.84">should be or their culture&apos;s idea is not</text><text start="658.38" dur="4.199">their own and then they have kind of</text><text start="659.7" dur="4.68">this path change</text><text start="662.579" dur="4.38">um</text><text

this</text><text start="772.8" dur="3.18">was significantly disadvantageous</text><text start="774.779" dur="3.12">because like</text><text start="775.98" dur="3.419">it wasn&apos;t until I was an

dur="3.06">American history and things that were</text><text start="803.94" dur="2.82">actually important that I just didn&apos;t</text><text start="805.139" dur="3.301">know were important I just had none of</text><text start="806.76" dur="3.66">them but then there were some areas that</text><text start="808.44" dur="3.54">I got to study way more deeply than</text><text start="810.42" dur="3.06">people normally would have at those</text><text start="811.98" dur="3.06">times but because I was studying things</text><text start="813.48" dur="3.78">I was interested in</text><text start="815.04" dur="3.539">I doubled down on interest right and I</text><text start="817.26" dur="3.84">think one of the things that happens for</text><text start="818.579" dur="3.541">a kid is when you don&apos;t facilitate their</text><text start="821.1" dur="3.539">interests because you don&apos;t know how</text><text start="822.12" dur="3.719">which so often the kids are asking</text><text

because</text><text start="830.399" dur="4.981">they come up all the time when a kid</text><text start="833.04" dur="6.239">asks why is the sky blue or why is fire</text><text start="835.38" dur="6.24">hot you have to understand many layers</text><text start="839.279" dur="5.641">of physics but then also neuroscience</text><text start="841.62" dur="4.98">and then also the philosophy of

dur="2.58">you know how to facilitate the interest</text><text start="868.74" dur="4.32">they end up learning everything from</text><text start="870.12" dur="4.44">theory of mind too uh philosophy

dur="3.66">but if you don&apos;t facilitate the things</text><text start="880.5" dur="3.779">they&apos;re interested in and you force them</text><text start="882.54" dur="3.599">to do that they&apos;re not interested</text><text start="884.279" dur="3.601">in it can break their interest and then</text><text start="886.139" dur="5.76">they become a little bit more focused on</text><text

start="929.16" dur="2.34">terms of their Interest being things</text><text start="930.42" dur="3.479">were</text><text start="931.5" dur="4.68">a pretty good set of things so my my</text><text start="933.899" dur="4.261">parents were reading Buckminster Fuller</text><text start="936.18" dur="4.5">and kind of design science and they were</text><text start="938.16" dur="4.919">reading David

start="962.94" dur="5.6">were like my primitive Concepts and</text><text start="966.0" dur="4.86">included in those were the core</text><text start="968.54" dur="4.12">existential questions of what are we</text><text start="970.86" dur="3.779">what are we here for what is this all</text><text start="972.66" dur="4.26">about and then the people using kind of</text><text start="974.639" dur="3.961">the most advanced Frameworks of the time</text><text start="976.92" dur="3.659">like systems theory and design science</text><text start="978.6" dur="4.979">to think about how do we go about making</text><text start="980.579" dur="5.641">a better world and like that so I never</text><text start="983.579" dur="5.041">really had to find my way to that that</text><text start="986.22" dur="6.359">was kind of the default setting</text><text start="988.62" dur="5.579">I had to find and upon further inquiry</text><text start="992.579" dur="3.481">of like was that a wrong default setting</text><text start="994.199" dur="3.361">should I just</text><text start="996.06" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="997.56" dur="4.139">just make money or make art or something</text><text start="999.42" dur="6.359">else like no that didn&apos;t that ended up</text><text start="1001.699" dur="8.281">continuing to be roughly right direction</text><text start="1005.779" dur="6.541">um but trying to more competently answer</text><text start="1009.98" dur="3.599">how to understand the issues of the</text><text start="1012.32" dur="4.759">world and how to be of service to them</text><text start="1013.579" dur="8.401">there&apos;s a lot of content refinement</text><text start="1017.079" dur="8.081">and Daniel so you had a an unusually</text><text start="1021.98" dur="5.699">broad self-directed education but</text><text start="1025.16" dur="4.2">there&apos;s also something else that&apos;s quite</text><text start="1027.679" dur="4.5">distinctive about your thinking and that</text><text start="1029.36" dur="7.339">is a rare degree of integration</text><text start="1032.179" dur="4.52">and how did how did you develop that</text><text start="1038.36" dur="6.3">I have friends who are developmental</text><text start="1041.6" dur="5.28">theorists uh who</text><text start="1044.66" dur="3.899">Zach Stein who I work with closely and</text><text start="1046.88" dur="4.26">many others</text><text start="1048.559" dur="6.0">who we&apos;ll talk about how there&apos;s an</text><text start="1051.14" dur="4.38">increase in the type of</text><text start="1054.559" dur="2.941">um</text><text start="1055.52" dur="4.98">complexity of what someone can process</text><text start="1057.5" dur="5.4">the way they notice changes in context</text><text start="1060.5" dur="4.2">for processing the same content the way</text><text start="1062.9" dur="3.06">they can seek and shift perspectives and</text><text start="1064.7" dur="3.18">then integrate them and I think there&apos;s</text><text start="1065.96" dur="3.719">a lot true and important there</text><text start="1067.88" dur="3.72">have other friends who are critics of</text><text start="1069.679" dur="4.86">Developmental Theory because they say</text><text start="1071.6" dur="5.22">there&apos;s a lot of societal normative</text><text start="1074.539" dur="4.38">assumptions based on how people are kind</text><text start="1076.82" dur="3.06">of ubiquitously trained that in a</text><text start="1078.919" dur="2.041">different Society with different</text><text start="1079.88" dur="2.82">childhood development would go</text><text start="1080.96" dur="4.079">differently</text><text start="1082.7" dur="4.14">um so for instance</text><text start="1085.039" dur="3.301">if kids</text><text start="1086.84" dur="5.1">are being</text><text start="1088.34" dur="5.579">taught in school this is math this is</text><text start="1091.94" dur="4.02">social studies this is history this is</text><text start="1093.919" dur="3.961">biology and they&apos;re being taught a</text><text start="1095.96" dur="3.54">compartmentalized Universe where they&apos;re</text><text start="1097.88" dur="3.419">never asked how the social science is</text><text start="1099.5" dur="3.62">being influenced by the biology or vice</text><text start="1101.299" dur="4.021">versa or how the principles Co apply</text><text start="1103.12" dur="4.36">they&apos;re getting a non-integrated</text><text start="1105.32" dur="4.8">fragmented world</text><text start="1107.48" dur="4.92">given to them and actually behaviorally</text><text start="1110.12" dur="3.6">trained up on thinking that way they&apos;re</text><text start="1112.4" dur="3.12">not being given any kind of integrated</text><text start="1113.72" dur="3.12">framework so then we get excited when</text><text start="1115.52" dur="2.76">someone becomes an integrative thinker</text><text start="1116.84" dur="2.699">later because it was trained out of</text><text start="1118.28" dur="3.72">everybody</text><text start="1119.539" dur="5.161">um uh I don&apos;t think it is actually</text><text start="1122.0" dur="6.0">necessary that people learn that way I</text><text start="1124.7" dur="4.76">think it&apos;s not even the case in say</text><text start="1128.0" dur="4.679">um</text><text start="1129.46" dur="5.92">pre-industrialized education it was just</text><text start="1132.679" dur="4.86">wasn&apos;t even the case in the same way</text><text start="1135.38" dur="5.34">um and so</text><text start="1137.539" dur="5.041">because my education was self-directed</text><text start="1140.72" dur="4.199">it also didn&apos;t have clear delineations</text><text start="1142.58" dur="5.4">of topics I was never doing</text><text start="1144.919" dur="4.321">math or social studies I was doing an</text><text start="1147.98" dur="2.699">inquiry about something that was</text><text start="1149.24" dur="3.36">interesting that might have involved</text><text start="1150.679" dur="3.721">some math and some you know quite a few</text><text start="1152.6" dur="4.28">things so</text><text start="1154.4" dur="5.22">if you&apos;re trying to understand</text><text start="1156.88" dur="5.02">integrative things like how does a body</text><text start="1159.62" dur="4.919">cell organize how does a fetus actually</text><text start="1161.9" dur="4.74">develop how does that then</text><text start="1164.539" dur="4.981">you&apos;re having to intrinsically be</text><text start="1166.64" dur="5.399">radically interdisciplinary</text><text start="1169.52" dur="4.32">um what is worth doing in the world and</text><text start="1172.039" dur="3.841">how do we know and</text><text start="1173.84" dur="3.839">um so I think the most interesting</text><text start="1175.88" dur="4.02">questions are at a high enough level of</text><text start="1177.679" dur="4.74">abstraction to address them well there&apos;s</text><text start="1179.9" dur="4.98">the taxonomy of questions beneath them</text><text start="1182.419" dur="4.62">is very interdisciplinary and you</text><text start="1184.88" dur="4.5">actually have to bridge across them</text><text start="1187.039" dur="4.581">so I do think</text><text start="1189.38" dur="4.919">um a totally different educational</text><text start="1191.62" dur="6.28">Paradigm could have</text><text start="1194.299" dur="4.801">uh analysis and synthesis or integration</text><text start="1197.9" dur="3.0">on and all that said happening</text><text start="1199.1" dur="3.12">simultaneously at each level of</text><text start="1200.9" dur="2.659">complexity</text><text start="1202.22" dur="5.52">yeah</text><text start="1203.559" dur="6.521">and underneath pulling together uh some</text><text start="1207.74" dur="4.559">of the things you&apos;ve said you&apos;ve spoken</text><text start="1210.08" dur="5.4">to your education you&apos;ve spoken to the</text><text start="1212.299" dur="5.101">to the Natural uh integrative thinking</text><text start="1215.48" dur="5.18">that emerges from a problem-solving</text><text start="1217.4" dur="6.019">approach to education as opposed to a</text><text start="1220.66" dur="5.74">compartmentalized uh Scholastic</text><text

an appreciation of</text><text start="1233.9" dur="6.54">the whole and a desire to optimize</text><text start="1237.62" dur="5.48">service and it seems like what I&apos;m</text><text start="1240.44"

dur="4.38">valuable it was to have invested people</text><text start="1729.98" dur="3.96">be in that level of dialogue I started</text><text start="1732.26" dur="5.159">seeking out tutors before I

dur="4.92">for parents what to do with their kids</text><text start="1742.7" dur="4.68">I</text><text start="1744.38" dur="4.919">I somehow knew because I also had stuff</text><text start="1747.38"

wanted</text><text start="1767.299" dur="3.901">to learn I figured out what I could</text><text start="1768.98" dur="4.26">possibly do to be useful to them and</text><text start="1771.2"

dur="3.96">anyway I&apos;ve got to bring this up we&apos;re</text><text start="2137.98" dur="4.02">preparing for this I went through your</text><text start="2140.14" dur="3.54">websites and I came across a Blog</text><text start="2142.0" dur="3.72">article you&apos;d written things that I</text><text start="2143.68" dur="6.419">learned from my dad</text><text start="2145.72" dur="7.08">I was deeply moved by this a halfway</text><text start="2150.099" dur="5.101">through when we got to the part uh how</text><text start="2152.8" dur="5.819">to treat women I think I I started</text><text start="2155.2" dur="5.22">weeping and uh immediately</text><text start="2158.619" dur="4.141">I like your father but I like you</text><text start="2160.42" dur="5.4">because this is what you remembered from</text><text start="2162.76" dur="5.46">your father and it was so incredibly</text><text start="2165.82" dur="5.519">powerful and basic</text><text start="2168.22" dur="7.2">and I see such a a need</text><text start="2171.339" dur="7.441">for young men to be initiated into some</text><text start="2175.42" dur="5.159">sort of positive manhood and what your</text><text start="2178.78" dur="3.24">father laid out I got a lot from my</text><text start="2180.579" dur="3.721">father but obviously he was not as</text><text start="2182.02" dur="3.599">articulate it&apos;s your dad he lived a lot</text><text start="2184.3" dur="5.039">of these principles you were talking</text><text start="2185.619" dur="5.22">about and can I read one of them</text><text start="2189.339" dur="5.101">um</text><text start="2190.839" dur="6.661">God I love this the highest value</text><text start="2194.44" dur="5.84">for men is serving women</text><text start="2197.5" dur="6.98">nature and children future Generations</text><text start="2200.28" dur="4.2">the highest value for men</text><text start="2205.42" dur="5.54">you should shout it from the rooftops</text><text start="2207.099" dur="3.861">that&apos;s incredibly profound</text><text start="2211.96" dur="3.659">yeah my dad would say things all the</text><text start="2213.76" dur="3.72">time like you&apos;re either serving your</text><text start="2215.619" dur="3.601">family or the family of mankind or</text><text start="2217.48" dur="3.359">you&apos;re off path those are the only two</text><text start="2219.22" dur="3.2">things you can be doing that are not off</text><text start="2220.839" dur="3.421">path</text><text start="2222.42" dur="3.76">and</text><text start="2224.26" dur="4.38">um the family of mankind was the term</text><text start="2226.18" dur="4.74">used but inclusive of</text><text start="2228.64" dur="4.34">life not just human life</text><text start="2230.92" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="2233.32" dur="6.539">yeah I mean I wrote that</text><text start="2236.8" dur="4.62">because my dad&apos;s Health was very uh</text><text start="2239.859" dur="2.941">delicate at the time and it wasn&apos;t clear</text><text start="2241.42" dur="3.6">if he was going to be around much longer</text><text start="2242.8" dur="5.46">or not and</text><text start="2245.02" dur="4.86">so often people write a eulogy of all</text><text start="2248.26" dur="3.0">the things that they appreciated from</text><text start="2249.88" dur="3.239">their parent after they&apos;re dead and they</text><text start="2251.26" dur="3.06">don&apos;t get to experience it directly and</text><text start="2253.119" dur="5.941">I thought that</text><text start="2254.32" dur="6.42">that would be a loss and so uh I wanted</text><text start="2259.06" dur="4.08">to write it for that reason</text><text start="2260.74" dur="4.26">but I also wanted to write it that</text><text start="2263.14" dur="4.38">particular one is definitely not a full</text><text start="2265.0" dur="4.859">expression of what I learned from my dad</text><text start="2267.52" dur="5.099">it was called things I learned about</text><text start="2269.859" dur="5.22">being a man from my dad</text><text start="2272.619" dur="4.621">um and so it was it was definitely</text><text start="2275.079" dur="4.321">oriented to</text><text start="2277.24" dur="4.02">the</text><text start="2279.4" dur="3.959">principles that have to do with transfer</text><text start="2281.26" dur="4.26">of masculinity as opposed to just would</text><text start="2283.359" dur="3.841">be equally true for all people some of</text><text start="2285.52" dur="3.72">them are of course that</text><text start="2287.2" dur="5.76">and part of the reason that I wrote it</text><text start="2289.24" dur="6.42">at that time was I think I&apos;d had</text><text start="2292.96" dur="5.94">in conversations arise in the week or</text><text start="2295.66" dur="4.679">two before of</text><text start="2298.9" dur="6.959">men</text><text start="2300.339" dur="8.221">young men so boy into man phase who</text><text start="2305.859" dur="5.821">had just clearly never been fathered in</text><text start="2308.56" dur="5.34">important ways and were causing pain to</text><text start="2311.68" dur="5.04">women they were in relationships with to</text><text start="2313.9" dur="4.679">people around them were being poorer</text><text start="2316.72" dur="4.28">leaders and</text><text start="2318.579" dur="5.161">it was just um</text><text start="2321.0" dur="5.26">I was like there are so many people that</text><text start="2323.74" dur="4.08">didn&apos;t have so many men that are in</text><text start="2326.26" dur="3.48">their masculine role not having the</text><text start="2327.82" dur="4.259">fortune of having had a good role model</text><text start="2329.74" dur="5.16">or good teaching in that way and I</text><text start="2332.079" dur="5.28">wonder if some tiny little bit of</text><text start="2334.9" dur="4.38">vicarious element of it can come through</text><text start="2337.359" dur="5.041">by writing about it so that&apos;s why I</text><text start="2339.28" dur="5.1">wrote that one in that way I think it</text><text start="2342.4" dur="3.42">came through for me brother thank you</text><text start="2344.38" dur="3.719">for that</text><text start="2345.82" dur="4.74">um and one of the things he said is like</text><text start="2348.099" dur="3.961">on your time off what you do is you get</text><text start="2350.56" dur="3.36">in your pickup truck this was before</text><text start="2352.06" dur="4.08">cell phones and all and you drive around</text><text start="2353.92" dur="4.439">and find people are having trouble with</text><text start="2356.14" dur="3.54">their cars getting them started you fix</text><text start="2358.359" dur="3.24">their cars and send them on their way</text><text start="2359.68" dur="3.72">and he said that&apos;s a good time that&apos;s</text><text start="2361.599" dur="4.381">the way to spend your day off and it&apos;s</text><text start="2363.4" dur="5.04">always orientation Noble disinterested</text><text start="2365.98" dur="5.46">service and it&apos;s just</text><text start="2368.44" dur="6.659">I I anyway but it was so funny because</text><text start="2371.44" dur="5.639">yeah this was before cell phones and so</text><text start="2375.099" dur="3.181">when someone was broken down on the side</text><text start="2377.079" dur="3.601">of the road pulling over to pick them up</text><text start="2378.28" dur="3.42">was an important thing and um you know</text><text start="2380.68" dur="3.84">my</text><text start="2381.7" dur="6.419">I think part of teaching someone about</text><text start="2384.52" dur="6.059">how the world Works in general</text><text start="2388.119" dur="5.421">and also part of the ideas and I</text><text start="2390.579" dur="2.961">understand this is</text><text start="2393.76" dur="4.74">um normative like bigender normative</text><text start="2396.18" dur="5.439">thinking on the thing</text><text start="2398.5" dur="5.76">um that is how it was given to me uh</text><text start="2401.619" dur="5.781">was that for</text><text start="2404.26" dur="6.18">a boy growing into a man knowing how to</text><text start="2407.4" dur="5.02">solve problems and fix things those are</text><text start="2410.44" dur="4.98">particularly important thing so</text><text start="2412.42" dur="5.04">um anytime there was construction to do</text><text start="2415.42" dur="3.48">he always involved me in it even where</text><text start="2417.46" dur="4.44">involving me and it took a lot more time</text><text start="2418.9" dur="4.56">than doing it without me because he was</text><text start="2421.9" dur="4.439">not just trying to fix the thing he was</text><text start="2423.46" dur="5.34">also trying to raise a child who would</text><text start="2426.339" dur="4.141">someday not just be an adult but would</text><text start="2428.8" dur="3.42">themselves be a parent and a teacher and</text><text start="2430.48" dur="3.48">how to do that thing properly and</text><text start="2432.22" dur="3.78">whenever there was something to fix on</text><text start="2433.96" dur="4.92">the car it took 10 times longer to show</text><text start="2436.0" dur="5.339">me how to do it and you know then uh</text><text start="2438.88" dur="5.219">then not and so</text><text start="2441.339" dur="4.081">but then it was also well we&apos;re fixing</text><text start="2444.099" dur="3.181">the car</text><text start="2445.42" dur="3.96">there were so many things like if a job</text><text start="2447.28" dur="4.26">is worth doing it&apos;s worth doing well and</text><text start="2449.38" dur="4.02">well begun is half done and see the job</text><text start="2451.54" dur="3.78">do the job stay out of the misery these</text><text start="2453.4" dur="3.959">kind of idioms and the if a job is worth</text><text start="2455.32" dur="4.86">doing it&apos;s worth doing well meant</text><text start="2457.359" dur="4.681">you just know half-assing the thing like</text><text start="2460.18" dur="4.26">we and so like I&apos;ll give you an example</text><text start="2462.04" dur="4.2">that was so beautiful</text><text start="2464.44" dur="3.48">I remember the first

dur="4.561">so</text><text start="2567.119" dur="3.941">think through the process pretty well</text><text start="2570.16" dur="3.36">first</text><text start="2571.06" dur="3.539">and anticipate where the mistakes and</text><text start="2573.52" dur="2.46">the problems and the challenges are</text><text start="2574.599" dur="3.061">going to happen there&apos;s so much of my</text><text

dur="8.299">process better and uh yeah yeah like I</text><text start="2590.38" dur="7.34">can see now how you were basically uh</text><text start="2594.359" dur="8.561">self-taught and coached and mentored</text><text start="2597.72" dur="8.26">into uh into the ideals which would lead</text><text start="2602.92" dur="5.58">you into a life of service into a way of</text><text start="2605.98" dur="7.2">thinking which would bring you into a</text><text start="2608.5" dur="9.18">big picture approach and into a planning</text><text start="2613.18" dur="7.98">mode that would allow you to anticipate</text><text start="2617.68" dur="8.22">second third order complications and to</text><text start="2621.16" dur="7.22">think through those to uh you were honed</text><text start="2625.9" dur="4.56">for the work you&apos;re doing</text><text start="2628.38" dur="3.4">now there&apos;s something that I was</text><text start="2630.46" dur="2.82">starting to say it&apos;s important please</text><text start="2631.78" dur="2.579">remember your thoughts because I don&apos;t</text><text start="2633.28" dur="4.26">want you to forget it but I don&apos;t want</text><text start="2634.359" dur="4.98">to forget this you were you had</text><text start="2637.54" dur="3.48">um mentioned John the</text><text start="2639.339" dur="3.78">um that a fun time was to load up the</text><text start="2641.02" dur="3.36">tools and go looking for people who are</text><text start="2643.119" dur="3.061">broken down and fix up their car because</text><text start="2644.38" dur="3.06">AAA wouldn&apos;t say they come all the time</text><text start="2646.18" dur="3.899">especially if it was snowing outside</text><text start="2647.44" dur="5.52">they could actually be in danger</text><text start="2650.079" dur="4.861">um so obviously that meant</text><text start="2652.96" dur="5.399">you know they&apos;re</text><text start="2654.94" dur="5.28">I had to know some how to fix a car type</text><text start="2658.359" dur="4.201">skills so</text><text start="2660.22" dur="4.44">I was mentioning that my dad would take</text><text start="2662.56" dur="3.779">a lot more time to do the thing than pay</text><text start="2664.66" dur="3.24">someone else to do it and to do it with</text><text start="2666.339" dur="3.48">me than do it on his own because he was</text><text start="2667.9" dur="5.1">wanting me to learn</text><text start="2669.819" dur="5.52">ing these other deeper psychological</text><text start="2673.0" dur="5.4">spiritual Integrity lessons along with</text><text start="2675.339" dur="4.381">it like well begun is half done and if a</text><text start="2678.4" dur="4.699">job&apos;s worth doing it&apos;s worth doing well</text><text start="2679.72" dur="5.58">but then also</text><text start="2683.099" dur="4.541">learning the mechanical engineering of</text><text start="2685.3" dur="4.559">why was the screw threaded this way</text><text start="2687.64" dur="3.959">rather than the other way and why was</text><text start="2689.859" dur="3.421">The Sting built this way and then the</text><text start="2691.599" dur="3.361">history of internal combustion engines</text><text start="2693.28" dur="2.52">and when the transmission came out and</text><text start="2694.96" dur="2.76">the</text><text start="2695.8" dur="3.38">um you know like and and then the</text><text start="2697.72" dur="4.26">physics of</text><text start="2699.18" dur="4.72">how the explosion happens inside of the</text><text start="2701.98" dur="5.339">piston and so there&apos;s a very integrated</text><text start="2703.9" dur="5.82">set of knowledge that was happening</text><text start="2707.319" dur="4.561">and that takes just a lot of investment</text><text start="2709.72" dur="4.26">right it takes a lot of care and a lot</text><text start="2711.88" dur="4.32">of investment and</text><text start="2713.98" dur="6.18">but then when we would do that it was</text><text start="2716.2" dur="5.22">like Sunday the other Sun let&apos;s have fun</text><text start="2720.16" dur="2.76">um</text><text start="2721.42" dur="5.28">he wasn&apos;t into sports so we didn&apos;t throw</text><text start="2722.92" dur="4.98">a ball uh that&apos;s my my hand eye</text><text start="2726.7" dur="2.58">coordination at the level of ball</text><text start="2727.9" dur="4.439">throwing didn&apos;t develop all that much</text><text start="2729.28" dur="4.74">but we would uh</text><text start="2732.339" dur="3.361">load the</text><text start="2734.02" dur="3.12">load the truck up with tools and go look</text><text start="2735.7" dur="4.68">for people who are broken down fix it up</text><text start="2737.14" dur="6.66">and the interesting thing was it didn&apos;t</text><text start="2740.38" dur="5.28">feel like some Dreadful sacrifice of</text><text start="2743.8" dur="3.66">service that we had to do the way that a</text><text start="2745.66" dur="3.54">lot of people</text><text start="2747.46" dur="3.6">um feel when they&apos;re doing some church</text><text start="2749.2" dur="3.0">activity as kids they don&apos;t like if I</text><text start="2751.06" dur="2.88">like the most fun thing we could</text><text start="2752.2" dur="4.32">possibly do like it was just actually</text><text start="2753.94" dur="3.96">really enjoyable because one I&apos;m getting</text><text start="2756.52" dur="2.579">this high quality time with my dad right</text><text start="2757.9" dur="2.34">he&apos;s not trying to get me to go do the</text><text start="2759.099" dur="3.121">thing on my own</text><text start="2760.24" dur="3.9">who were getting to</text><text start="2762.22" dur="3.18">be learning in the process and then</text><text start="2764.14" dur="3.42">helping people where there&apos;s this</text><text start="2765.4" dur="3.78">immediate you know expression of these</text><text start="2767.56" dur="4.08">people being delighted and surprised and</text><text start="2769.18" dur="5.7">so there was absolutely it wasn&apos;t just</text><text start="2771.64" dur="6.6">like an ethic of service it was like uh</text><text start="2774.88" dur="5.4">like a way to condition that as</text><text start="2778.24" dur="4.02">that the what I want for myself</text><text start="2780.28" dur="5.1">personally and who I want to be for the</text><text start="2782.26" dur="4.26">world there wasn&apos;t even a distinction</text><text start="2785.38" dur="2.58">yeah</text><text start="2786.52" dur="4.98">beautiful</text><text start="2787.96" dur="5.399">yeah another thing your dad said Not Top</text><text start="2791.5" dur="4.319">apartment on your dad I could go on and</text><text start="2793.359" dur="4.74">on this but he said and this is so</text><text start="2795.819" dur="3.901">simple but so profound he said</text><text start="2798.099" dur="3.841">forgive</text><text start="2799.72" dur="4.56">just as a given you&apos;ve got to forgive</text><text start="2801.94" dur="3.78">and the second part is help them do</text><text start="2804.28" dur="3.66">better</text><text start="2805.72" dur="4.379">so you just don&apos;t forgive okay I&apos;m okay</text><text start="2807.94" dur="4.139">I&apos;m clear you know it doesn&apos;t bother</text><text start="2810.099" dur="5.281">anymore because I forgiven but the other</text><text start="2812.079" dur="6.721">part is help them do better I just think</text><text start="2815.38" dur="5.459">that&apos;s one of my when I was a kid and</text><text start="2818.8" dur="6.059">there&apos;s a period where my</text><text start="2820.839" dur="5.461">parents were uh in the TM community and</text><text start="2824.859" dur="3.121">um built this beautiful Community called</text><text start="2826.3" dur="3.72">Lakeview Estates out in

development business</text><text start="2834.819" dur="5.461">and there was someone that was an</text><text start="2837.16" dur="5.28">extremely close friend of the family and</text><text start="2840.28" dur="5.1">um an employee and partner</text><text start="2842.44" dur="5.1">who had for</text><text start="2845.38" dur="3.3">whatever reasons</text><text start="2847.54" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="2848.68" dur="4.2">decided that uh</text><text start="2850.96" dur="3.659">he was going to</text><text start="2852.88" dur="2.84">come into our house and steal a bunch of</text><text start="2854.619" dur="4.381">the artwork</text><text start="2855.72" dur="5.26">and uh because he you know had the key</text><text start="2859.0" dur="4.26">to the house and all like that</text><text start="2860.98" dur="4.859">and</text><text start="2863.26" dur="5.28">uh you know a betrayal like that</text><text start="2865.839" dur="4.5">oftentimes very easy to be like</text><text start="2868.54" dur="3.18">want to be vindictive or at least</text><text start="2870.339" dur="4.141">totally cut ties</text><text start="2871.72" dur="4.56">I remember my dad intercepting him not</text><text start="2874.48" dur="3.24">letting him do that and then taking him</text><text start="2876.28" dur="3.6">out and having this conversation like</text><text start="2877.72" dur="4.26">dude what the like what happened</text><text start="2879.88" dur="4.38">inside your head is this who you want to</text><text start="2881.98" dur="3.78">be and there was still to like help them</text><text start="2884.26" dur="2.7">do better</text><text start="2885.76" dur="3.839">um</text><text start="2886.96" dur="4.619">and</text><text start="2889.599" dur="2.76">one of the ones that really stood out to</text><text start="2891.579" dur="3.181">me</text><text start="2892.359" dur="4.321">and you know I there&apos;s something where I</text><text start="2894.76" dur="3.78">feel torn about this first just as a</text><text start="2896.68" dur="3.72">caveat I must say</text><text start="2898.54" dur="3.9">the reason I didn&apos;t write one about my</text><text start="2900.4" dur="4.32">mom at the time was because I don&apos;t</text><text start="2902.44" dur="3.659">think there is as gruesome a deficit of</text><text start="2904.72" dur="2.94">mothering in the world as there is</text><text start="2906.099" dur="5.161">fathering currently</text><text start="2907.66" dur="6.78">and so I didn&apos;t have as many women</text><text start="2911.26" dur="5.46">sharing with me just like kind of abject</text><text start="2914.44" dur="3.419">failures of fundamental things as I had</text><text start="2916.72" dur="2.58">guys so I was a little bit more</text><text start="2917.859" dur="4.681">motivated for that reason also her</text><text start="2919.3" dur="6.36">health is better but my mother is also</text><text start="2922.54" dur="5.52">every bit as important in in my life and</text><text start="2925.66" dur="4.02">childhood and who I became and uh was</text><text start="2928.06" dur="3.66">the one that got me into activism and</text><text start="2929.68" dur="3.419">had me going door to door with and that</text><text start="2931.72" dur="2.879">all the protests with Peta and</text><text start="2933.099" dur="4.321">Greenpeace and all those things as a kid</text><text start="2934.599" dur="5.341">and got me studying art and introduced</text><text start="2937.42" dur="3.84">me to Dolly and Picasso and

dur="3.661">had a strong patriarchal line that</text><text start="2954.4" dur="4.08">taught him some of these things his dad</text><text start="2956.02" dur="4.62">was first generation green beret and so</text><text start="2958.48" dur="3.96">that you know thought that way but he</text><text start="2960.64" dur="4.199">also had a really up childhood</text><text start="2962.44" dur="3.84">with a humongous amount of trauma</text><text start="2964.839" dur="3.78">um his dad commits suicide his sister</text><text start="2966.28" dur="4.079">commits suicide is</text><text start="2968.619" dur="3.781">um many of his family members were in</text><text start="2970.359" dur="3.98">and out of incarceration and mental</text><text start="2972.4" dur="3.9">institutions and</text><text start="2974.339" dur="4.061">and</text><text start="2976.3" dur="4.14">um the violence of the childhood he was</text><text start="2978.4" dur="5.219">in he&apos;s covered in physical scars from</text><text start="2980.44" dur="4.2">weapons you know like he had a rough go</text><text start="2983.619" dur="3.601">of it</text><text start="2984.64" dur="4.8">and so some of what he got he got</text><text start="2987.22" dur="5.28">directly but a lot of it was</text><text start="2989.44" dur="5.46">uh his way to not kill himself was to</text><text start="2992.5" dur="3.72">say maybe he&apos;s not crazy the entire</text><text start="2994.9" dur="2.88">world is crazy because the whole world</text><text start="2996.22" dur="2.94">he was exposed to seemed completely</text><text start="2997.78" dur="3.839">crazy to him</text><text start="2999.16" dur="3.84">and he&apos;d rethink everything from scratch</text><text start="3001.619" dur="3.421">and</text><text start="3003.0" dur="3.9">so when you do that you come up with a</text><text start="3005.04" dur="3.12">lot of good and interesting things and</text><text start="3006.9" dur="3.24">also we&apos;re going to make a lot of</text><text start="3008.16" dur="4.439">mistakes and they&apos;re painful Parts in</text><text start="3010.14" dur="4.8">the process and I didn&apos;t emphasize those</text><text start="3012.599" dur="4.441">in that letter because it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="3014.94" dur="4.2">um the purpose of the letter uh the</text><text start="3017.04" dur="5.64">article but</text><text start="3019.14" dur="6.0">uh you know my path benefited from all</text><text start="3022.68" dur="4.08">the extreme gifts and it had some like</text><text start="3025.14" dur="3.78">quite</text><text

dur="5.16">from a from the utility perspective of</text><text start="3421.14" dur="3.54">helping them get why they should care we</text><text start="3423.42" dur="2.82">we look at what they currently

a</text><text start="3503.7" dur="3.919">something more like a perception</text><text start="3508.2" dur="6.06">um I think if someone is perceiving</text><text start="3511.28" dur="4.72">somewhat clearly</text><text start="3514.26" dur="5.16">then the sacredness of life is</text><text start="3516.0" dur="6.839">primification just is is</text><text start="3519.42" dur="6.72">and I don&apos;t remember the exact quote but</text><text start="3522.839" dur="5.46">it was uh um</text><text start="3526.14" dur="4.26">Joseph Campbell quote it was something</text><text start="3528.299" dur="4.8">to the effect of</text><text start="3530.4" dur="6.0">that we think what we want is to know</text><text start="3533.099" dur="5.101">what the meaning of life is when what</text><text start="3536.4" dur="3.36">we&apos;re actually seeking is the experience</text><text start="3538.2" dur="3.48">of being Fully Alive</text><text start="3539.76" dur="3.299">and I don&apos;t think that is the whole</text><text start="3541.68" dur="3.0">because someone can experience being</text><text start="3543.059" dur="4.201">Fully Alive and fairly self-centered</text><text start="3544.68"

angst about what is the</text><text start="3557.579" dur="5.361">meaning of life</text><text start="3558.839" dur="6.661">and I think that oftentimes the actual</text><text start="3562.94" dur="4.359">intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of</text><text start="3565.5" dur="4.44">meaningfulness of life that happens</text><text start="3567.299" dur="6.3">through a deep enough</text><text start="3569.94" dur="5.399">bandwidth of connection and sensing</text><text start="3573.599" dur="4.561">uh</text><text start="3575.339" dur="5.341">the longing for that</text><text start="3578.16" dur="4.679">it&apos;s filtered through the Mind as a</text><text start="3580.68" dur="3.84">desire to understand what is the purpose</text><text start="3582.839" dur="3.181">of all of this what is the meaning with</text><text start="3584.52" dur="4.26">a whole bunch of bad assumptions about</text><text start="3586.02" dur="5.64">like what thing is it building to it</text><text start="3588.78" dur="5.579">seems like a terminal value that then I</text><text start="3591.66" dur="4.38">can&apos;t that will be a satisfying answer</text><text start="3594.359" dur="3.0">where if we say well the purpose is love</text><text start="3596.04" dur="3.36">then I say well what is the purpose of</text><text start="3597.359" dur="4.381">that or the purpose is learning what</text><text start="3599.4" dur="4.26">it&apos;s versus</text><text start="3601.74" dur="4.559">it&apos;s</text><text start="3603.66" dur="3.659">so we can the first the concept of</text><text start="3606.299" dur="3.661">purpose and the concept of</text><text start="3607.319" dur="5.161">meaningfulness are not identical</text><text start="3609.96" dur="5.72">but the reality of them and the concept</text><text start="3612.48" dur="3.2">of them are not the same either</text><text start="3615.72" dur="5.099">um and so</text><text start="3617.64" dur="4.5">how to develop</text><text

that they</text><text start="4192.98" dur="3.48">um they forget that like they learn</text><text start="4195.38" dur="2.28">things and they forget and they&apos;re like</text><text start="4196.46" dur="3.06">oh yeah that was a bummer I forgot let</text><text start="4197.66" dur="3.66">me get back on path with it there&apos;s some</text><text start="4199.52" dur="3.3">different depth of the care about the</text><text start="4201.32" dur="3.66">thing that is of course the result of</text><text start="4202.82" dur="3.78">all the exposure and whatever and I&apos;m</text><text start="4204.98" dur="3.48">like yeah there is something where it is</text><text start="4206.6" dur="4.02">like actually</text><text start="4208.46" dur="4.739">like the differences actually believing</text><text start="4210.62" dur="4.86">there&apos;s a God right meaning</text><text start="4213.199" dur="4.621">um but it and that was the term that I</text><text start="4215.48" dur="5.58">used to just kind of

dur="2.94">there is something for me and belief in</text><text start="4235.58" dur="2.94">karma can do that right there is</text><text start="4236.84" dur="2.819">something that is like believing in

dur="3.781">actually harming you</text><text start="4313.1" dur="4.38">yes because now it deadens your</text><text start="4315.5" dur="3.48">perceptions now it creates</text><text start="4317.48" dur="3.719">less</text><text start="4318.98" dur="3.719">you don&apos;t see the reality you see the</text><text start="4321.199" dur="4.261">frame of the reality that you expect to</text><text

start="4614.48" dur="6.84">just for quick point of reference</text><text start="4618.32" dur="4.5">I would not say that I am a physicalist</text><text start="4621.32" dur="4.52">or an idealist</text><text start="4622.82" dur="5.76">in the classic philosophical sense of</text><text start="4625.84" dur="5.2">physicalist meaning that physics comes</text><text start="4628.58"

start="4639.739" dur="3.601">physics is an emergent property of</text><text start="4641.42" dur="3.239">Consciousness structures of mind or</text><text start="4643.34" dur="3.96">something</text><text start="4644.659" dur="4.201">I would say that</text><text start="4647.3" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="4648.86" dur="5.28">the</text><text start="4650.84" dur="5.16">the subjective stuff and the

dur="3.54">talk about first person third person can</text><text start="4659.42" dur="3.54">talk about</text><text start="4661.04" dur="5.0">um the quality and the physics</text><text start="4662.96" dur="3.08">but they</text><text start="4666.44" dur="5.46">are equally fundamental</text><text start="4669.02" dur="4.199">and co-informing co-arising facets of an</text><text start="4671.9"

dur="4.681">so I wouldn&apos;t say Consciousness is</text><text start="4681.5" dur="3.659">deeper than physics to the nature of</text><text start="4683.36" dur="3.359">reality</text><text start="4685.159" dur="4.5">um I think that&apos;s a weird kind of</text><text start="4686.719" dur="5.221">dualism still</text><text start="4689.659" dur="4.02">um I think information Theory affecting</text><text start="4691.94" dur="4.739">physics has already started to get a lot</text><text start="4693.679" dur="4.5">of people at least in this realm</text><text start="4696.679" dur="3.601">because if you say okay well</text><text start="4698.179" dur="4.02">Consciousness stuff is deeper than</text><text start="4700.28" dur="3.78">physics stuff like well what is physics</text><text start="4702.199" dur="3.601">stuff well it&apos;s like atoms</text><text start="4704.06" dur="4.22">atoms or subatomic particles and</text><text start="4705.8" dur="5.22">subatomic particles or some weird</text><text start="4708.28" dur="4.78">heisenbergen Schrodinger thing which</text><text start="4711.02" dur="5.46">seems a lot like</text><text start="4713.06" dur="4.679">some type of pattern of information</text><text start="4716.48" dur="4.98">it doesn&apos;t sound like physics anymore</text><text start="4717.739" dur="6.241">right and it doesn&apos;t necessarily sound</text><text start="4721.46" dur="4.38">as different it&apos;s not like just some</text><text start="4723.98" dur="3.239">dead inert matter it doesn&apos;t sound as</text><text start="4725.84" dur="2.76">different from the Consciousness stuff</text><text start="4727.219" dur="2.881">especially as you start to do a similar</text><text start="4728.6" dur="2.96">dive on with the conscious and stuff is</text><text start="4730.1" dur="3.0">because you say well is that information</text><text start="4731.56" dur="4.0">processing on some information</text><text start="4733.1" dur="5.7">processing substrate what does that mean</text><text start="4735.56" dur="4.92">so in the same way</text><text start="4738.8" dur="3.24">that I wouldn&apos;t say Consciousness is</text><text start="4740.48" dur="4.699">deeper than physics or the other way</text><text start="4742.04" dur="5.639">around I wouldn&apos;t say that the</text><text start="4745.179" dur="3.821">psychological drivers of the metacrisis</text><text start="4747.679" dur="3.361">are deeper</text><text start="4749.0" dur="3.96">than the technological or the economic</text><text start="4751.04" dur="6.199">ones</text><text start="4752.96" dur="8.279">um I would say that they are</text><text start="4757.239" dur="5.92">co-informing co-influencing and that to</text><text start="4761.239" dur="3.721">really address it there are necessary</text><text start="4763.159" dur="4.621">things that have to happen across each</text><text start="4764.96" dur="6.54">of those areas and its efficiency only</text><text start="4767.78" dur="5.82">happens across all of them and uh I</text><text start="4771.5" dur="4.199">won&apos;t belabor the point because we&apos;ve</text><text start="4773.6" dur="3.54">written and talked about it we wrote a</text><text start="4775.699" dur="3.901">paper</text><text start="4777.14" dur="5.039">um in the consilience project called why</text><text start="4779.6" dur="5.16">technology is not values neutral</text><text start="4782.179" dur="4.921">and it&apos;s worth people looking at and</text><text start="4784.76" dur="6.0">then beautiful paper</text><text start="4787.1" dur="4.8">yeah it shows just a brief overview of</text><text start="4790.76" dur="4.439">the work of</text><text start="4791.9" dur="4.56">Marvin Harris and</text><text start="4795.199" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="4796.46" dur="5.239">and Marshall mcluhan and uh so many</text><text start="4799.04" dur="5.1">people and theory of Technology of

dur="5.299">you know there&apos;s always this question of</text><text start="4818.239" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="4820.34" dur="4.56">does the</text><text start="4822.38" dur="4.38">what

gets wiped out</text><text start="4843.86" dur="4.74">um and so</text><text start="4845.84" dur="4.8">I I&apos;m framing it this way because I</text><text start="4848.6" dur="6.9">think the deeper thing is actually</text><text start="4850.64" dur="7.38">really problematic it&apos;s uh you mentioned</text><text start="4855.5" dur="4.739">um Roger the reductionism</text><text start="4858.02" dur="3.9">one type of reductionism is to say</text><text start="4860.239" dur="3.181">there&apos;s only one thing the other type is</text><text start="4861.92" dur="4.2">say there&apos;s a handful of things but my</text><text start="4863.42" dur="6.36">favorite thing is the most important one</text><text start="4866.12" dur="7.2">um and so being able to understand</text><text start="4869.78" dur="5.459">the co arising and non-reduced process</text><text start="4873.32" dur="3.98">is actually really important</text><text start="4875.239" dur="2.061">um</text><text start="4877.78" dur="5.98">if I can introduce the concept here</text><text start="4880.219" dur="5.221">Daniel I find I I have a neologism which</text><text start="4883.76" dur="4.439">is Omni determinism everything</text><text start="4885.44" dur="5.94">determines everything and I think that&apos;s</text><text start="4888.199" dur="5.361">what you&apos;re speaking to yeah</text><text start="4891.38" dur="2.18">um</text><text start="4894.14" dur="4.62">yeah I might more usually talk about</text><text start="4896.78" dur="3.78">Omni influence that everything is</text><text start="4898.76" dur="4.62">influencing everything but not in a way</text><text start="4900.56" dur="6.54">that is absolutely deterministic because</text><text start="4903.38" dur="5.88">uh nice refinement thank you there are</text><text start="4907.1" dur="4.92">things that are outside of hard</text><text start="4909.26" dur="6.24">determinism still the influence the net</text><text start="4912.02" dur="5.46">result of what happens also when we say</text><text start="4915.5" dur="3.6">Omni we mean in the direction of all</text><text start="4917.48" dur="3.48">inclusive but we can never actually

we</text><text start="4926.6" dur="4.86">aren&apos;t being that&apos;s actually important</text><text start="4929.3" dur="3.359">um I can know for sure that I am not</text><text start="4931.46"

dur="3.96">so</text><text start="4941.179" dur="3.721">the framing of the meta crisis we often</text><text start="4943.76" dur="2.64">talk about</text><text start="4944.9" dur="5.339">uh</text><text

attachment Theory</text><text start="5266.639" dur="4.721">uh bonding the ideas of codependence and</text><text start="5269.92" dur="4.259">interdependence were totally different</text><text start="5271.36" dur="5.4">and we evolved in that setting right so</text><text start="5274.179" dur="3.601">then we get birth control and we&apos;re like</text><text start="5276.76" dur="2.76">oh sex

that thing</text><text start="5295.6" dur="3.539">but a huge part of our whole being is</text><text start="5297.4" dur="4.02">responding that way so the reason I</text><text start="5299.139" dur="5.341">bring this up is if we were to try to</text><text start="5301.42" dur="6.259">comprehensively list</text><text start="5304.48" dur="3.199">all of the things</text><text start="5308.26"

set of</text><text start="5317.92" dur="4.86">individual thriving a community thriving</text><text start="5319.719" dur="5.901">or Global thriving would be we this</text><text start="5322.78" dur="2.84">podcast would take days</text><text start="5325.9" dur="5.42">um and so that&apos;s a big topic I just</text><text start="5328.719" dur="2.601">wanna yeah</text><text start="5331.42" dur="3.239">um</text><text start="5332.199" dur="4.861">if and I say that because if I say</text><text start="5334.659" dur="5.221">anything else first I&apos;m</text><text start="5337.06" dur="4.44">concerned that people over Norm on that</text><text start="5339.88" dur="4.38">as the thing</text><text start="5341.5" dur="5.1">and then again lose observation to all</text><text start="5344.26" dur="4.68">the things and complexity of all things</text><text start="5346.6" dur="4.38">so if I wanted to speak to something as</text><text start="5348.94" dur="5.82">the thing it would be</text><text start="5350.98" dur="5.88">the nature of mind that makes us lose</text><text start="5354.76" dur="4.68">orientation to the complexity and the</text><text start="5356.86" dur="4.02">interconnectivity of all the things</text><text start="5359.44" dur="3.719">um</text><text start="5360.88" dur="4.44">so if I was going to try to say what is</text><text start="5363.159" dur="4.441">the psychological generator function of</text><text start="5365.32" dur="5.46">the metacrisis</text><text start="5367.6" dur="5.88">one I think as good a way of saying it</text><text start="5370.78" dur="4.74">as I could is kind of</text><text start="5373.48" dur="3.9">it&apos;s not exactly the way David bone said</text><text start="5375.52" dur="4.74">it but it&apos;s derived</text><text start="5377.38" dur="5.52">from the way I heard him when he said</text><text start="5380.26" dur="4.56">the</text><text start="5382.9" dur="4.319">problems of the world result from a</text><text start="5384.82" dur="3.54">fragmented Consciousness that sees the</text><text start="5387.219" dur="3.0">world as a bunch of parts and doesn&apos;t</text><text start="5388.36" dur="3.72">see the wholeness of things and he</text><text start="5390.219" dur="3.841">talked about wholeness and the implicate</text><text start="5392.08" dur="4.44">order and can we perceive through that</text><text start="5394.06" dur="4.26">wholeness and obviously we know he was a</text><text start="5396.52" dur="3.42">student of Einstein&apos;s and Einstein said</text><text start="5398.32" dur="2.819">it&apos;s an optical delusion of</text><text start="5399.94" dur="2.759">Consciousness to believe there are</text><text start="5401.139" dur="3.721">separate things there is one thing that</text><text start="5402.699" dur="4.921">we call universe and that we have to</text><text start="5404.86" dur="4.819">work to develop our perceptions</text><text start="5407.62" dur="2.059">um</text><text start="5410.38" dur="4.1">so some of the problems in the world</text><text start="5412.06" dur="5.099">happen by be by</text><text start="5414.48" dur="4.06">intentionally advantaging some things at</text><text start="5417.159" dur="3.54">the expense of other things we know</text><text start="5418.54" dur="4.02">it&apos;ll cause an expense so we&apos;re</text><text start="5420.699" dur="3.901">advantaging</text><text start="5422.56" dur="3.72">our country at the expense of another</text><text start="5424.6" dur="4.619">country in a war</text><text

people</text><text start="5433.12" dur="4.14">um that obviously means we&apos;re able to</text><text start="5434.739" dur="5.701">separate the world enough to be able to</text><text start="5437.26" dur="4.86">think about this trade-off of good for</text><text start="5440.44" dur="3.66">these ones</text><text start="5442.12" dur="3.539">and even though we know it&apos;s bad for</text><text start="5444.1" dur="4.079">these ones okay because we separate the</text><text start="5445.659" dur="5.04">interconnectedness of everything</text><text start="5448.179" dur="4.321">and whether it&apos;s a country doing that to</text><text start="5450.699" dur="3.241">another country or in a relationship a</text><text start="5452.5" dur="3.12">person doing that to another person</text><text start="5453.94" dur="3.239">thinking they can possibly win a fight</text><text start="5455.62" dur="2.76">and someone they love actually not get</text><text start="5457.179" dur="3.0">their needs met and that equals a good</text><text start="5458.38" dur="4.08">life for them somehow which is</text><text start="5460.179" dur="3.441">ridiculous idea</text><text start="5462.46" dur="4.199">um</text><text start="5463.62" dur="4.599">uh or at the level of Corporations or</text><text start="5466.659" dur="4.201">anything else</text><text start="5468.219" dur="4.321">or humans with regard to the biosphere</text><text start="5470.86" dur="3.42">other animals we can advantage ourselves</text><text start="5472.54" dur="4.86">at their expense which obviously a</text><text

the oceans are</text><text start="5480.88" dur="4.759">not good for the people working on them</text><text start="5482.5" dur="3.139">in poor conditions</text><text start="5485.739" dur="3.181">the other problems in the world is where</text><text start="5487.54" dur="3.24">we didn&apos;t know that we&apos;re causing the</text><text start="5488.92" dur="3.48">harm right so we can either

dur="4.02">something at the harm of something else</text><text start="5495.88" dur="4.44">not knowing so conflict theory and</text><text start="5498.04" dur="4.8">mistake Theory</text><text start="5500.32" dur="4.44">um and the real politic assessment of</text><text start="5502.84" dur="4.799">humans is the problems in the world are</text><text start="5504.76" dur="4.379">because we are dumb and nasty right like</text><text start="5507.639" dur="4.381">roughly if you want to make it very</text><text start="5509.139" dur="4.681">simple dumb is we caused problems that</text><text start="5512.02" dur="4.139">we didn&apos;t anticipate and nasty as we</text><text start="5513.82" dur="5.7">call problems that we knew were going to</text><text start="5516.159" dur="4.801">happen and so the how do we Enlighten</text><text start="5519.52" dur="3.6">humans has to deal with both the dumb</text><text start="5520.96" dur="4.5">and nasty part right if we&apos;re talking if</text><text start="5523.12" dur="4.2">we&apos;re talking about how do we have the</text><text start="5525.46" dur="3.779">not not just how do you affect human</text><text start="5527.32" dur="3.899">behavior through different rewards and</text><text start="5529.239" dur="3.601">deterrents and social norms and systems</text><text start="5531.219" dur="3.301">of law but through people wanting</text><text start="5532.84" dur="4.68">something different having an internal</text><text start="5534.52" dur="4.26">motivational basis it would be can we</text><text start="5537.52" dur="3.179">expand the Circle

about</text><text start="6387.36" dur="5.04">it so uh for it</text><text start="6389.639" dur="5.221">and it was looking at</text><text start="6392.4" dur="3.96">uh the mode of being</text><text

beauty is</text><text start="6407.76" dur="6.959">so there it says the motive being</text><text start="6411.239" dur="6.0">at its Essence is about really deeply</text><text start="6414.719" dur="4.98">taking in the beauty of reality</text><text start="6417.239" dur="4.38">and appreciating it giving gratitude for</text><text start="6419.699" dur="4.261">it honoring it loving it you know all</text><text start="6421.619" dur="5.641">those things it&apos;s the essence of what</text><text start="6423.96" dur="5.58">the mode of being is really about</text><text start="6427.26" dur="5.04">and that the mode of doing</text><text start="6429.54" dur="5.52">is about being in service to the beauty</text><text start="6432.3" dur="4.2">of reality protecting it adding to it</text><text start="6435.06" dur="3.599">perfect</text><text start="6436.5" dur="4.56">and the mode of becoming is deepening</text><text start="6438.659" dur="6.441">the capacity for being and

dur="4.381">um and if what I&apos;m doing isn&apos;t arising</text><text start="6458.1" dur="3.119">out of everything&apos;s up so I have</text><text start="6459.54" dur="3.84">to fix everything but it&apos;s arising out</text><text start="6461.219" dur="3.601">of perceiving</text><text start="6463.38" dur="3.0">working on this hunger issue because</text><text start="6464.82" dur="3.18">we&apos;re perceiving the utter</text><text start="6466.38" dur="3.9">meaningfulness and beauty of these kids</text><text start="6468.0" dur="4.98">or these people in their life and the</text><text start="6470.28" dur="4.879">importance of it and the and so then the</text><text start="6472.98" dur="5.04">doing the desire to Serve and Protect</text><text start="6475.159" dur="4.661">arises not from the perception of all</text><text start="6478.02" dur="4.56">the Badness but actually arises from the</text><text start="6479.82" dur="5.339">perception of the Beauty from which the</text><text start="6482.58" dur="3.48">good which also means the bad is framed</text><text start="6485.159" dur="2.46">at all</text><text start="6486.06" dur="4.139">right so the thing that really is</text><text start="6487.619" dur="4.981">terrible and pisses us off is because</text><text start="6490.199" dur="4.381">something that is beautiful and sacred</text><text start="6492.6" dur="3.119">is being harmed which then brings us</text><text start="6494.58" dur="4.02">back to there&apos;s something that we</text><text start="6495.719" dur="4.261">actually love and have Devotion to so we</text><text start="6498.6" dur="2.94">trace it back to that and say how do I</text><text start="6499.98" dur="5.52">be in service there</text><text start="6501.54" dur="7.619">so the doing must arise from the being</text><text start="6505.5" dur="5.52">and the becoming is I don&apos;t just want to</text><text start="6509.159" dur="3.661">perceive the beauty I currently see I</text><text start="6511.02" dur="3.84">want to perceive</text><text start="6512.82" dur="4.799">ever deeper dimensions of things that I</text><text start="6514.86" dur="6.12">had missed you know I want to ask</text><text start="6517.619" dur="5.04">what aspects of the of reality are</text><text start="6520.98" dur="3.78">important and beautiful that I&apos;m missing</text><text start="6522.659" dur="4.5">that other people are noticing that I&apos;m</text><text start="6524.76" dur="3.66">not honoring as fully as I could</text><text start="6527.159" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="6528.42" dur="3.96">and then similarly with our doing where</text><text start="6530.52" dur="4.02">do I have Frameworks for what I&apos;m where</text><text start="6532.38" dur="4.739">is what I&apos;m doing coming from</text><text start="6534.54" dur="4.56">ego and Trauma and wounding where have I</text><text start="6537.119" dur="3.241">been running a strategy so long if I</text><text start="6539.1" dur="2.46">stopped and thought about it from</text><text start="6540.36" dur="3.42">scratch I might come up with something</text><text start="6541.56" dur="5.52">better you know like I want to be</text><text start="6543.78" dur="7.859">deepening the doing as well</text><text start="6547.08" dur="6.48">so I think if one relates to</text><text start="6551.639" dur="3.661">appreciating the beauty of Life adding</text><text start="6553.56" dur="4.92">to it deepening the capacity for both</text><text start="6555.3" dur="4.14">that&apos;s a nice framework to start</text><text start="6558.48" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="6559.44" dur="4.259">and then there was another resource put</text><text start="6561.3" dur="4.08">on there called Dharma inquiry which is</text><text start="6563.699" dur="3.841">more personal because that&apos;s obviously</text><text start="6565.38" dur="6.0">true for everybody that our main query</text><text start="6567.54" dur="7.26">gets more into specific things one is</text><text start="6571.38" dur="5.7">bothered by and is inspired by and has</text><text start="6574.8" dur="3.24">aptitude at and is called to to have a</text><text

dur="4.8">with it I realized that</text><text start="6586.619" dur="3.721">there&apos;s something both very beautiful</text><text start="6588.3" dur="4.2">about the kind of bodhisattva Direction</text><text start="6590.34" dur="5.779">and something that is incomplete about a</text><text start="6592.5" dur="6.239">certain direction of it I was I was</text><text start="6596.119" dur="5.08">incredibly influenced by</text><text start="6598.739" dur="4.38">valve the bodhisattva and the may I</text><text start="6601.199" dur="4.44">become whatever is needed</text><text start="6603.119" dur="5.161">and</text><text start="6605.639" dur="5.401">when you look around and try to perceive</text><text start="6608.28" dur="5.459">what is needed and try to develop within</text><text start="6611.04" dur="4.8">yourself what can offer something there</text><text start="6613.739" dur="6.781">I remember the the first time I actually</text><text start="6615.84" dur="6.779">read it was in Alex Gray&apos;s art book The</text><text start="6620.52" dur="4.44">I think sacred mirrors and he had the</text><text start="6622.619" dur="4.56">ability painting and then he had this</text><text start="6624.96" dur="4.259">poem next to him so beautiful</text><text start="6627.179" dur="4.281">and it said something like where there</text><text start="6629.219" dur="2.241">is</text><text start="6631.56" dur="3.599">uh thirst May a rainfall upon the people</text><text start="6634.08" dur="3.36">in Miami</text><text start="6635.159" dur="3.721">may I myself

what is needed</text><text start="6646.44" dur="5.34">I think</text><text start="6648.48" dur="5.82">that helps one to recognize that what</text><text start="6651.78" dur="4.62">they love is deeper to who they are than</text><text start="6654.3" dur="3.66">who they think they are</text><text start="6656.4" dur="3.839">beautiful</text><text start="6657.96" dur="3.659">because I think I like these

start="6663.719" dur="5.041">can&apos;t help with that because I&apos;m not a</text><text start="6666.42" dur="3.779">a legal scholar or I&apos;m not a</text><text start="6668.76" dur="3.72">construction worker I&apos;m not a whatever</text><text start="6670.199" dur="3.781">it is and yeah it&apos;s like but if that&apos;s</text><text start="6672.48" dur="4.04">the thing that is most needed and would</text><text start="6673.98" dur="4.8">help what you care about most</text><text start="6676.52" dur="4.599">can you can you become something that</text><text start="6678.78" dur="4.08">you are not and I&apos;ve had many times</text><text start="6681.119" dur="3.06">where there was something that I was not</text><text start="6682.86" dur="3.0">good at that I actually really</text><text start="6684.179" dur="4.56">identified as a thing I would never want</text><text start="6685.86" dur="4.68">we go down and realize that it actually</text><text start="6688.739" dur="3.96">mattered to what I cared about enough</text><text start="6690.54" dur="3.84">that if I held that limited identity I</text><text start="6692.699" dur="3.661">was not in maximum service to what I</text><text start="6694.38" dur="4.319">claim to care about and I had to get</text><text start="6696.36" dur="4.68">like well I I care about what I care</text><text start="6698.699" dur="5.121">about so long as it fits with my</text><text start="6701.04" dur="2.78">identity easily</text><text start="6704.54" dur="4.36">identity so that&apos;s what I like about the</text><text start="6707.04" dur="6.02">Battle of the bodhisattva</text><text start="6708.9" dur="4.16">but where it&apos;s missing something is</text><text start="6713.46" dur="3.9">I really</text><text start="6714.9" dur="4.5">am not equally good at all the things</text><text start="6717.36" dur="4.2">that are needed nor can I do all of the</text><text start="6719.4" dur="4.92">things even if I try there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="6721.56" dur="6.0">people have to do all the things</text><text start="6724.32" dur="5.7">so if medicine work is needed and if</text><text start="6727.56" dur="4.26">economics change is needed and if care</text><text start="6730.02" dur="3.48">of the individual people and animals is</text><text start="6731.82" dur="4.5">needed as well as macro systemic</text><text start="6733.5" dur="4.08">thinking about systems to do that</text><text start="6736.32" dur="3.899">cool</text><text start="6737.58" dur="5.46">not only what is most needed but what is</text><text start="6740.219" dur="4.681">most needed that my being is well</text><text start="6743.04" dur="3.78">developed to be able to be in service to</text><text start="6744.9" dur="3.779">is important</text><text start="6746.82" dur="4.5">and so those Dharma questions are trying</text><text start="6748.679" dur="4.621">to help hone that for people</text><text start="6751.32" dur="5.46">beautiful and</text><text start="6753.3" dur="5.939">and you&apos;re pointing to the kinds of</text><text start="6756.78" dur="6.18">questions we need to ask ourselves in</text><text start="6759.239" dur="5.821">order to in order to orient ourselves to</text><text start="6762.96" dur="5.219">be most effective instruments of service</text><text start="6765.06" dur="5.9">or for the in the bodhisattva aspiration</text><text start="6768.179" dur="5.281">for the welfare and Awakening of all and</text><text start="6770.96" dur="4.179">I really think that probably that body</text><text start="6773.46" dur="4.259">side for aspiration may be one of the</text><text start="6775.139" dur="5.341">highest ideals the miners human mind has</text><text start="6777.719" dur="5.101">ever come up with and such a beautiful</text><text start="6780.48" dur="4.199">thing and you&apos;re pointing now to the</text><text start="6782.82" dur="4.14">questions we ask which the first</text><text start="6784.679" dur="5.161">question that emerges is well what what</text><text start="6786.96" dur="4.62">can I do but then you&apos;re pointing to the</text><text start="6789.84" dur="3.779">idea that this because there are</text><text start="6791.58" dur="5.7">questions deeper than that what&apos;s the</text><text start="6793.619" dur="6.841">most effective thing I can do and d and</text><text start="6797.28" dur="7.56">along with that the question well the</text><text start="6800.46" dur="7.92">colon actually what am I called to do</text><text start="6804.84" dur="6.24">and deeper still in your implication is</text><text start="6808.38" dur="4.56">is the question how can I live my life</text><text start="6811.08" dur="2.88">so as to be an optimal instrument of</text><text start="6812.94" dur="3.66">service</text><text start="6813.96" dur="5.219">and each of those is I think better</text><text start="6816.6" dur="4.74">thought of as a as a cone or a wisdom</text><text start="6819.179" dur="4.321">question and I would draw the</text><text start="6821.34" dur="4.14">distinction saying a conceptual question</text><text start="6823.5" dur="4.619">is you know is it raining outside take a</text><text start="6825.48" dur="4.44">look no end of question but wisdom</text><text start="6828.119" dur="3.301">questions are more like cons every time</text><text start="6829.92" dur="2.759">you ask them they have the potential for</text><text start="6831.42" dur="3.54">taking you deeper into the question</text><text start="6832.679" dur="4.621">deeper into life deeper into yourself</text><text start="6834.96" dur="5.219">and so you&apos;re pointing us towards we&apos;re</text><text start="6837.3" dur="3.839">the real the wisdom questions of our</text><text start="6840.179" dur="3.361">time</text><text start="6841.139" dur="5.721">I would also say that almost every value</text><text start="6843.54" dur="3.32">or principle</text><text start="6848.639" dur="4.801">lives in a dialectical relationship with</text><text start="6851.58" dur="3.36">another value or principle that is</text><text start="6853.44" dur="2.88">complementary but they might seem almost</text><text start="6854.94" dur="4.259">opposite</text><text start="6856.32" dur="5.76">and that without holding them together</text><text

time and get</text><text start="7206.3" dur="4.5">heartbroken and all the things the pot</text><text start="7208.28" dur="5.52">like it is intrinsically already</text><text start="7210.8" dur="6.419">meaningful without going anywhere</text><text start="7213.8" dur="5.04">and it&apos;s already beautiful and</text><text start="7217.219" dur="3.541">you know one of the other things I know</text><text start="7218.84" dur="5.6">y&apos;all talked about is Peak experiences</text><text start="7220.76" dur="3.68">and one of the things I always felt is</text><text start="7224.9" dur="3.739">once you have had one of them</text><text start="7231.139" dur="4.261">like for me I remember</text><text start="7233.96" dur="3.96">I remember discreetly I&apos;ve talked about</text><text start="7235.4" dur="3.96">before there was this one time I was</text><text start="7237.92" dur="2.779">watching a sunset</text><text start="7239.36" dur="3.96">and</text><text start="7240.699" dur="4.301">writing poetry to Nature and watching a</text><text start="7243.32" dur="4.16">sunset as a teenager</text><text start="7245.0" dur="4.619">and I remember the sunset was just so</text><text start="7247.48" dur="3.52">incredibly beautiful and I remember</text><text start="7249.619" dur="3.781">thinking</text><text start="7251.0" dur="4.86">if I had the choice if there is a spirit</text><text start="7253.4" dur="3.66">before this life if I had the choice to</text><text start="7255.86" dur="2.759">come here and incarnate and go through</text><text start="7257.06" dur="3.059">whatever painful things that I&apos;ve went</text><text start="7258.619" dur="4.381">through my whole life just to get to</text><text start="7260.119" dur="6.54">have this one experience of color and</text><text start="7263.0" dur="6.239">vision and the wind and the insects in</text><text start="7266.659" dur="3.901">this moment would totally do it like I</text><text start="7269.239" dur="3.541">would take every pain in my whole life</text><text start="7270.56" dur="4.82">to have had this experience as opposed</text><text start="7272.78" dur="2.6">to no experience</text><text start="7276.139" dur="4.98">and then I&apos;m like I&apos;ve had that I&apos;ve had</text><text start="7278.599" dur="4.52">so many of these experiences and one of</text><text start="7281.119" dur="4.741">them is worth incarnating for</text><text start="7283.119" dur="4.361">I&apos;ve had so many of them</text><text start="7285.86" dur="3.9">and so it&apos;s like the fact that I will</text><text start="7287.48" dur="4.32">probably have more of them is gravy and</text><text start="7289.76" dur="3.18">it&apos;s like a ridiculous Beauty and</text><text start="7291.8" dur="4.08">abundance</text><text start="7292.94" dur="4.08">but that every that future life gets to</text><text start="7295.88" dur="2.819">keep having those and that other people</text><text start="7297.02" dur="5.52">get to have more of those is kind of</text><text start="7298.699" dur="6.54">more what I&apos;m motivated by</text><text start="7302.54" dur="5.46">then they make us a better persons when</text><text start="7305.239" dur="5.581">we experience those things it it shifts</text><text start="7308.0" dur="5.099">you know something happens uh</text><text start="7310.82" dur="4.26">uh maybe just a little bit but something</text><text start="7313.099" dur="4.14">happens in a positive thing and shifts</text><text start="7315.08" dur="4.8">in our soul and iron carriers and maybe</text><text start="7317.239" dur="4.92">we behave a little a little better or a</text><text start="7319.88" dur="6.44">lot better I&apos;m not sure I think the</text><text start="7322.159" dur="4.161">what&apos;s in it for me thing chills out</text><text start="7326.42" dur="3.9">you know and it&apos;s not that it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="7328.4" dur="3.36">reboot because we&apos;re complex people with</text><text start="7330.32" dur="3.56">lots of parts and there will be a pain</text><text start="7331.76" dur="4.379">body that reboots and so it&apos;s not like</text><text start="7333.88" dur="3.759">Enlightenment is a static thing and you</text><text start="7336.139" dur="4.08">have a Satori and then you never have a</text><text start="7337.639" dur="4.261">pain body boot again it does</text><text start="7340.219" dur="5.061">but there&apos;s something about even just</text><text start="7341.9" dur="3.38">thinking about and just being like</text><text start="7346.46" dur="4.62">there could have been no I no experience</text><text start="7349.04" dur="4.26">at all</text><text start="7351.08" dur="6.86">and there&apos;s experience</text><text start="7353.3" dur="4.64">and have been such amazing ones and</text><text start="7359.78" dur="5.04">and I feel this pretty much with every</text><text start="7362.619" dur="3.941">difficulty or trauma too is like when</text><text start="7364.82" dur="3.299">you&apos;ve done the healing work with it you</text><text start="7366.56" dur="4.579">don&apos;t still feel messed up by the trauma</text><text start="7368.119" dur="6.961">or the pain but you do feel</text><text start="7371.139" dur="6.52">ongoingly benefited by the lessons</text><text start="7375.08" dur="5.099">and it&apos;s kind of like a lot of people</text><text start="7377.659" dur="4.02">don&apos;t have the resources or know how to</text><text start="7380.179" dur="2.821">do the healing so they never get the</text><text start="7381.679" dur="3.0">lessons and they&apos;re just always affected</text><text start="7383.0" dur="3.84">by the pain and that&apos;s a bummer</text><text start="7384.679" dur="4.141">but if one kind of has the resources</text><text start="7386.84" dur="4.56">knows how to work on it then the pain is</text><text start="7388.82" dur="4.26">temporary and the gifts are lasting</text><text start="7391.4" dur="4.14">and it&apos;s like this just beneficial</text><text start="7393.08" dur="5.28">asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry</text><text start="7395.54" dur="4.26">where it&apos;s like yeah I just I&apos;m a yes to</text><text start="7398.36" dur="2.339">the whole thing let&apos;s say yes to the</text><text start="7399.8" dur="5.1">whole thing</text><text start="7400.699" dur="5.881">yeah and there&apos;s there&apos;s a beautiful uh</text><text start="7404.9" dur="4.62">couple of lines that came out of San</text><text
