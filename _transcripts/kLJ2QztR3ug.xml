many</text><text start="4.38" dur="4.08">critics of social justice and wokeness</text><text start="6.48" dur="4.619">they operate in a game theoretic or</text><text start="8.46" dur="4.74">evolutionary framework one prime example</text><text start="11.099" dur="3.781">is Brett and Eric Weinstein they have</text><text start="13.2" dur="3.659">multiple fundamental criticism of</text><text start="14.88" dur="3.84">capitalism and they think the future is</text><text start="16.859" dur="4.801">some form of a mix between capitalism</text><text start="18.72" dur="5.399">and socialism here&apos;s what Eric Weinstein</text><text start="21.66" dur="4.68">says and whether or not we are going to</text><text start="24.119" dur="5.781">leaven our capitalism with some</text><text start="26.34" dur="6.419">communism or start from some sort of</text><text start="29.9" dur="6.339">socialist ideal and realize that if we</text><text start="32.759" dur="5.701">don&apos;t find a way to grow our pie very</text><text start="36.239" dur="4.561">aggressively with the tiny number of</text><text start="38.46" dur="4.74">individuals who are capable of taking</text><text start="40.8" dur="3.779">over operations of great complexity I</text><text start="43.2" dur="3.78">think that we&apos;re going to have some kind</text><text start="44.579" dur="3.601">of a hybrid system now why do they think</text><text start="46.98" dur="3.48">that there&apos;s a need for mixing</text><text start="48.18" dur="3.78">capitalism with socialism one of their</text><text start="50.46" dur="3.239">Central arguments is that while the</text><text start="51.96" dur="4.079">incentive structure of capitalism is</text><text start="53.699" dur="4.2">beneficial since the reward goes to</text><text start="56.039" dur="4.621">those who provide The Wanted services on</text><text start="57.899" dur="5.221">a voluntary basis capitalism also</text><text start="60.66" dur="4.92">creates game theoretic traps that make</text><text start="63.12" dur="4.92">everyone worse off</text><text start="65.58" dur="4.02">Brett Weinstein gives the example of a</text><text start="68.04" dur="4.079">farmer that invents a new technology</text><text start="69.6" dur="7.199">which makes a farm more efficient you</text><text start="72.119" dur="8.341">could turn the extra the Surplus into a</text><text start="76.799" dur="5.581">kind of persistent uh luxury yeah a</text><text start="80.46" dur="3.659">luxury but I mean I don&apos;t even luxury is</text><text start="82.38" dur="3.96">a little bit too trivial sounding you</text><text start="84.119" dur="5.521">could turn it into a space where you use</text><text start="86.34" dur="6.18">that to to investigate important stuff</text><text start="89.64" dur="4.74">or you could turn it into more mouths to</text><text start="92.52" dur="3.66">feed in which case as soon as you&apos;ve</text><text start="94.38" dur="5.16">produced those extra mouths that are now</text><text start="96.18" dur="5.04">consuming the output of that farm now</text><text start="99.54" dur="3.66">the level of</text><text start="101.22" dur="4.92">um you know fear of starvation is right</text><text start="103.2" dur="5.4">back where it was so the idea here is</text><text start="106.14" dur="5.519">that sometimes market efficiency does</text><text start="108.6" dur="5.339">not Advance what we as humans want or</text><text start="111.659" dur="4.441">should want according to him the free</text><text start="113.939" dur="5.04">decision of individuals leading to a</text><text start="116.1" dur="5.76">growth in population is worse than using</text><text start="118.979" dur="5.881">the Surplus value of the farm to better</text><text start="121.86" dur="5.7">human welfare at this point we are at</text><text start="124.86" dur="4.739">the social engine nearing trap for which</text><text start="127.56" dur="3.539">people such as Eric and Brett Weinstein</text><text start="129.599" dur="3.72">advocate</text><text start="131.099" dur="4.521">one last example before we talk about</text><text start="133.319" dur="4.741">the problem with this here is Daniel</text><text start="135.62" dur="5.14">schmachtenberger someone who is closely</text><text start="138.06" dur="4.92">linked with Eric and bro Weinstein when</text><text start="140.76" dur="5.36">we look at the Myriad of environmental</text><text start="142.98" dur="3.14">issues that we face</text><text start="147.06" dur="4.88">that</text><text start="148.92" dur="5.34">we said are a result of the cumulative</text><text start="151.94" dur="5.439">effects of industrial Tech with</text><text start="154.26" dur="5.339">increasing population and increasing GDP</text><text start="157.379" dur="4.22">demands</text><text start="159.599" dur="4.441">foreign</text><text start="161.599" dur="4.601">to be able to have that kind of</text><text start="164.04" dur="3.66">overarching framework to look at it as</text><text start="166.2" dur="3.48">opposed to just individual areas because</text><text start="167.7" dur="4.319">if we look at say</text><text start="169.68" dur="8.58">um climate change as one</text><text start="172.019" dur="6.241">environmental risk that uh</text><text start="178.68" dur="5.76">is largely a result of excessive CO2</text><text start="182.7" dur="3.72">from the burning of</text><text start="184.44" dur="4.68">carbon-based things mostly fossil fuels</text><text start="186.42" dur="3.959">obviously there are methane and</text><text start="189.12" dur="5.339">Agriculture and other things but let&apos;s</text><text start="190.379" dur="6.481">just take uh take the carbon part</text><text start="194.459" dur="4.92">so as far as the supply chain goes</text><text start="196.86" dur="6.659">that&apos;s kind of the waste or the output</text><text start="199.379" dur="7.44">side of using hydrocarbons as fuel</text><text start="203.519" dur="5.821">the other side is that we&apos;re getting</text><text start="206.819" dur="6.06">diminishing returns on hydrocarbons that</text><text start="209.34" dur="8.36">we have a society that depends upon</text><text start="212.879" dur="8.28">hydrocarbons as the energy source and</text><text start="217.7" dur="5.92">while we&apos;re figuring out creative ways</text><text start="221.159" dur="4.8">like tar Sands and Shale and fracking</text><text start="223.62" dur="4.74">and offshore drilling to find the rest</text><text start="225.959" dur="3.721">of them we&apos;re having to go to harder</text><text start="228.36" dur="4.439">more difficult areas because we&apos;ve</text><text start="229.68" dur="4.619">already got most of the easy ones and it</text><text start="232.799" dur="3.541">takes a certain amount of oil to get</text><text start="234.299" dur="3.72">more oil so the energy return on energy</text><text start="236.34" dur="4.619">investment how much oil it takes to get</text><text start="238.019" dur="5.28">a new barrel of oil is increasing</text><text start="240.959" dur="4.621">uh when you look at the fact that the</text><text start="243.299" dur="3.781">total amount of GDP is very closely</text><text start="245.58" dur="4.519">coupled with the total amount of energy</text><text start="247.08" dur="3.019">use globally</text><text start="251.7" dur="6.539">and the GDP has to go up exponentially</text><text start="255.9" dur="4.44">just to keep up with interest that means</text><text start="258.239" dur="4.381">that there is a exponential demand for</text><text start="260.34" dur="5.16">the total amount of energy used but</text><text start="262.62" dur="6.299">we&apos;re getting a diminishing return on</text><text start="265.5" dur="5.88">hydrocarbons and the new non-hydrocorbin</text><text start="268.919" dur="4.861">sources of energy</text><text start="271.38" dur="4.02">have required more hydrocarbons to make</text><text start="273.78" dur="3.3">and they have a certain energy return on</text><text start="275.4" dur="3.9">energy investment of how long it takes</text><text start="277.08" dur="5.339">you know for them to pay off the there&apos;s</text><text start="279.3" dur="6.119">a there&apos;s a massive kind of Gap</text><text start="282.419" dur="6.301">um and uh and Reckoning on that side so</text><text start="285.419" dur="5.28">obviously you have all of the like I</text><text start="288.72" dur="3.96">said mountaintop removal mining for</text><text start="290.699" dur="4.381">coals and the environmental harm of that</text><text start="292.68" dur="4.92">and oil spills and geopolitical</text><text start="295.08" dur="4.619">destabilization over oil on the side of</text><text start="297.6" dur="5.34">getting it as well as the underlying</text><text start="299.699" dur="5.161">deep issues between the inner Global</text><text start="302.94" dur="4.92">Energy System and the global Finance</text><text start="304.86" dur="5.64">system that is also just the other side</text><text start="307.86" dur="3.96">of the supply chain of climate change so</text><text start="310.5" dur="2.88">you can see climate change when you look</text><text start="311.82" dur="3.719">at the entirety of the Energy System</text><text start="313.38" dur="4.319">you&apos;re like wow there&apos;s some</text><text start="315.539" dur="3.841">other really really critical And Timely</text><text start="317.699" dur="3.78">issues that are just part of looking at</text><text start="319.38" dur="6.3">the movement of hydrocarbons of the</text><text start="321.479" dur="6.261">system let alone everything else so</text><text start="325.68" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="330.479" dur="5.041">if you want to think about all of the</text><text start="333.18" dur="5.239">environmental issues from the point of</text><text start="335.52" dur="2.899">view of</text><text start="338.759" dur="6.0">nature having mostly closed-loop</text><text start="341.46" dur="4.86">processes that anything any type of</text><text start="344.759" dur="4.22">waste in nature is just food for</text><text start="346.32" dur="4.98">something else in a time scale that</text><text start="348.979" dur="5.681">doesn&apos;t lead to either waste</text><text start="351.3" dur="7.019">accumulation or depletion of a needed</text><text start="354.66" dur="5.819">resource every dead thing and every type</text><text start="358.319" dur="3.541">of byproduct feces or whatever is fully</text><text start="360.479" dur="4.381">metabolized by everything else in</text><text start="361.86" dur="4.679">ecosystem that that is not the same for</text><text start="364.86" dur="4.14">human technology and relationship with</text><text start="366.539" dur="4.741">the ecosystem that we utilize materials</text><text start="369.0" dur="3.9">that much faster than the earth can</text><text start="371.28" dur="2.82">regenerate them or we can regenerate</text><text start="372.9" dur="2.88">them through other sources and turn them</text><text start="374.1" dur="3.78">into waste much faster than nature can</text><text start="375.78" dur="3.419">turn them back into anything else and we</text><text start="377.88" dur="3.3">have real environmental harms from both</text><text start="379.199" dur="3.421">of those so the idea of a linear</text><text start="381.18" dur="3.48">materials economy</text><text start="382.62" dur="3.78">that is undergoing exponential growth on</text><text start="384.66" dur="3.36">a finite planet that thing has to shift</text><text start="386.4" dur="3.419">so we both have to deal with the</text><text start="388.02" dur="4.38">embedded growth obligation and finance</text><text start="389.819" dur="4.38">for exponential growth and we have to</text><text start="392.4" dur="4.079">deal with the closed loop on our</text><text start="394.199" dur="5.181">materials economy so that we are making</text><text start="396.479" dur="4.801">all of our new stuff from old stuff and</text><text start="399.38" dur="4.42">all of our</text><text start="401.28" dur="4.38">old stuff is not waste or pollution but</text><text start="403.8" dur="3.54">it&apos;s getting you know cycled back in to</text><text start="405.66" dur="3.36">make new stuff and that we&apos;re doing that</text><text start="407.34" dur="4.44">with the energy bandwidth actually</text><text start="409.02" dur="4.799">available to us now the problem with all</text><text start="411.78" dur="4.56">this thinking is that the gain theoretic</text><text start="413.819" dur="4.621">dynamics that are at play in a</text><text start="416.34" dur="4.699">capitalist system and need sometimes</text><text start="418.44" dur="5.52">fixing according to the social engineer</text><text start="421.039" dur="5.56">also apply at the level of the social</text><text start="423.96" dur="4.739">engineer the dynamic is its follows</text><text start="426.599" dur="4.021">there are various social Engineers</text><text start="428.699" dur="4.081">competing over being heard by the</text><text start="430.62" dur="4.079">population and the power dynamics</text><text start="432.78" dur="4.8">applies to them leading to a power track</text><text start="434.699" dur="5.4">after all the good willing and not</text><text start="437.58" dur="4.86">corrupt engineer will have a competitive</text><text start="440.099" dur="4.621">disadvantage against the corrupt one</text><text start="442.44" dur="4.74">that is willing to morally questionable</text><text start="444.72" dur="5.039">things and since the free market</text><text start="447.18" dur="5.579">mechanism does not apply to them there&apos;s</text><text start="449.759" dur="5.041">only this negative feedback loop without</text><text start="452.759" dur="5.041">the positive feedback loop of a market</text><text start="454.8" dur="5.399">where the customer ultimately decides so</text><text start="457.8" dur="4.619">while it&apos;s true that a free market can</text><text start="460.199" dur="4.381">produce failures from the perspective of</text><text start="462.419" dur="4.321">making the individuals involved worse</text><text start="464.58" dur="5.28">off compared to some not existing</text><text start="466.74" dur="5.28">envisioned ideal the social engineer who</text><text start="469.86" dur="4.5">tries to fix this is game theoretically</text><text start="472.02" dur="5.04">in a worse situation and will most</text><text start="474.36" dur="4.8">likely make the situation worse</text><text start="477.06" dur="4.38">here is Friedman about the positive</text><text start="479.16" dur="4.5">feedback loop of the market it&apos;s</text><text start="481.44" dur="3.659">certainly true that firms try to</text><text start="483.66" dur="3.719">persuade people to buy their products</text><text start="485.099" dur="4.141">just as Professor Wolfe has been trying</text><text start="487.379" dur="3.361">to persuade people to buy his ideas and</text><text start="489.24" dur="4.2">I&apos;ve been trying to persuade them to buy</text><text start="490.74" dur="4.26">mine but nonetheless when they try to</text><text start="493.44" dur="3.42">persuade people to buy something they</text><text start="495.0" dur="4.62">don&apos;t want to buy they end up losing</text><text start="496.86" dur="4.98">money uh similarly they can try to</text><text start="499.62" dur="4.56">persuade workers to come to work for the</text><text start="501.84" dur="4.44">firm to some extent they do but unless</text><text start="504.18" dur="5.22">they offer terms that the workers find</text><text start="506.28" dur="5.759">acceptable they don&apos;t get workers so the</text><text start="509.4" dur="5.1">ultimate and democracy the idea that</text><text start="512.039" dur="4.74">democracy is an inherently good thing</text><text start="514.5" dur="4.44">just democracy majority vote includes</text><text start="516.779" dur="5.281">the possibility of 55 of the people</text><text start="518.94" dur="5.579">deciding to enslave the other 45. that</text><text start="522.06" dur="5.339">that would still be Democratic so no I</text><text start="524.519" dur="4.5">don&apos;t want democracy uh you Professor</text><text start="527.399" dur="4.141">wolf seems to have missed my point about</text><text start="529.019" dur="4.32">dictatorship which was that competitive</text><text start="531.54" dur="3.84">dictatorship which is the way</text><text start="533.339" dur="4.021">restaurants are run is a good system</text><text start="535.38" dur="4.2">where it&apos;s possible because that means</text><text start="537.36" dur="4.26">that some particular thing is controlled</text><text start="539.58" dur="4.02">by somebody but it interacts with</text><text start="541.62" dur="3.54">everybody else on a voluntary basis and</text><text start="543.6" dur="4.14">therefore has to provide other people</text><text start="545.16" dur="3.42">terms they like now
