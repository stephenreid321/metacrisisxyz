particular</text><text start="6.839" dur="3.601">solution because if you&apos;re working on</text><text start="9.24" dur="4.68">something you should really care about</text><text start="10.44" dur="6.179">it but in really caring about it you can</text><text start="13.92" dur="4.8">become overly narrowly focused so when I</text><text start="16.619" dur="4.141">was first starting to try to wrap my</text><text start="18.72" dur="4.5">head around like</text><text start="20.76" dur="4.14">what is Upstream from all of these</text><text start="23.22" dur="3.799">various problems or what are the</text><text start="24.9" dur="4.44">underlying causes that everything from</text><text start="27.019" dur="4.18">nuclear war to environmental degradation</text><text start="29.34" dur="3.48">to animal rights issues to class issues</text><text start="31.199" dur="4.02">what do these things have in common what</text><text start="32.82" dur="4.079">do not a specific solution for one thing</text><text start="35.219" dur="4.321">but a solution for civilization doing</text><text start="36.899" dur="4.441">better look like I of course read the</text><text start="39.54" dur="3.06">work of people and also had the fortune</text><text start="41.34" dur="2.52">to talk to a lot of people that it&apos;s</text><text start="42.6" dur="3.24">been their life thinking about these</text><text start="43.86" dur="5.82">things and working on them</text><text start="45.84" dur="6.239">and would ask their analysis and</text><text start="49.68" dur="4.26">I got so many answers that sounded like</text><text start="52.079" dur="4.681">this</text><text start="53.94" dur="4.619">you know at</text><text start="56.76" dur="3.66">the end of the day</text><text start="58.559" dur="3.541">whenever somebody uses a phrase like</text><text start="60.42" dur="4.44">that at the end of the day or the key is</text><text start="62.1" dur="4.62">you can usually expect a reductionist</text><text start="64.86" dur="3.72">thing to come next</text><text start="66.72" dur="3.42">um not always but you like you know</text><text start="68.58" dur="4.5">sometimes you want to pay attention to</text><text start="70.14" dur="4.5">that at the end of the day</text><text start="73.08" dur="3.6">uh</text><text start="74.64" dur="3.96">really the thing we have to shift is the</text><text start="76.68" dur="3.06">economy because perverse economic</text><text start="78.6" dur="2.94">incentive is under the whole thing</text><text start="79.74" dur="4.44">there&apos;s no way that as long as you have</text><text start="81.54" dur="4.38">a for-profit military-industrial complex</text><text start="84.18" dur="4.02">is the largest block of a global economy</text><text start="85.92" dur="3.839">that you could ever have peace there&apos;s</text><text start="88.2" dur="3.3">an anti-incentive on it as long as</text><text start="89.759" dur="3.661">there&apos;s so much money to be made with</text><text start="91.5" dur="3.9">mining Etc like we have to fix the</text><text start="93.42" dur="2.94">nature of economic incentives I&apos;d be</text><text start="95.4" dur="2.219">nodding I&apos;m like this makes perfect</text><text start="96.36" dur="2.7">sense right and if somebody else would</text><text start="97.619" dur="3.901">be like</text><text start="99.06" dur="4.32">you know the core of the thing that we</text><text start="101.52" dur="4.62">have to address is</text><text start="103.38" dur="5.82">education because</text><text start="106.14" dur="4.74">you can have so much change occur in a</text><text start="109.2" dur="4.62">generation if those children are growing</text><text start="110.88" dur="4.559">up different as as different as it is</text><text start="113.82" dur="3.06">learning Chinese is your first language</text><text start="115.439" dur="3.0">versus learning English we&apos;re so</text><text start="116.88" dur="2.94">neuroplastic by the time we&apos;re adults</text><text start="118.439" dur="4.5">we&apos;re not that neuroplastic we&apos;re kind</text><text start="119.82" dur="6.299">of screwed if you get education right</text><text start="122.939" dur="5.281">we want adults who care about the</text><text start="126.119" dur="3.42">animals and the oceans and the contend</text><text start="128.22" dur="2.94">to all of these things and can think</text><text start="129.539" dur="2.761">complexly if we really get education</text><text start="131.16" dur="3.0">right we&apos;ll be able to solve everything</text><text start="132.3" dur="3.72">it&apos;s Upstream from all that and like I&apos;m</text><text start="134.16" dur="3.0">nodding I&apos;m like oh yeah this is it and</text><text start="136.02" dur="2.82">then somebody else would be like oh</text><text start="137.16" dur="4.38">really the thing is it&apos;s about media</text><text start="138.84" dur="4.08">because we&apos;re continuously being</text><text start="141.54" dur="2.82">bombarded and that was before social</text><text start="142.92" dur="3.179">media then it was social media we&apos;re</text><text start="144.36" dur="4.14">being continuously bombarded and we were</text><text start="146.099" dur="4.201">ready to go do a capital Riot or a</text><text start="148.5" dur="3.54">George Floyd protester Riot or whatever</text><text start="150.3" dur="3.78">it is based on the stuff that&apos;s coming</text><text start="152.04" dur="3.36">in if we could change the media</text><text start="154.08" dur="3.659">environment of what people were in</text><text start="155.4" dur="3.479">taking it would change all of these</text><text start="157.739" dur="2.521">things and then someone else&apos;s like no</text><text start="158.879" dur="4.44">no the thing is really at the end of the</text><text start="160.26" dur="4.32">day it&apos;s about government and law and</text><text start="163.319" dur="3.661">how do we get that right because the</text><text start="164.58" dur="4.26">economic incentive wouldn&apos;t be that same</text><text start="166.98" dur="3.72">issue if we could govern it properly if</text><text start="168.84" dur="4.08">we could force the internalization of</text><text start="170.7" dur="4.38">the price of carbon and get carbon</text><text start="172.92" dur="3.84">pricing properly and get costs of</text><text start="175.08" dur="2.82">everything proper all that would be</text><text start="176.76" dur="3.36">fixed but we have to do that through law</text><text start="177.9" dur="3.96">so how do we fix governance and law and</text><text start="180.12" dur="4.32">then somebody else will be like</text><text start="181.86" dur="4.14">you can&apos;t because laws written by</text><text start="184.44" dur="3.18">lobbyists that get paid for by somebody</text><text start="186.0" dur="2.76">and wherever the economic motive is is</text><text start="187.62" dur="2.96">what&apos;s going to pay for that which is</text><text start="188.76" dur="3.72">why you you have to think about</text><text start="190.58" dur="3.34">economics and a lot of the other so the</text><text start="192.48" dur="4.14">key is political economy and how do you</text><text start="193.92" dur="4.62">get that so and on and on people would</text><text start="196.62" dur="3.42">say no really the key is actually</text><text start="198.54" dur="2.94">parenting what we&apos;ve really got to do is</text><text start="200.04" dur="3.419">restore the family because before</text><text start="201.48" dur="3.839">education by the time that kid goes to</text><text start="203.459" dur="3.36">school at five or six that so much of</text><text start="205.319" dur="3.181">their identity and psyche and value</text><text start="206.819" dur="3.78">system has already said it happens early</text><text start="208.5" dur="3.72">on we have to actually change the entire</text><text start="210.599" dur="3.72">culture to have parenting emphasize</text><text start="212.22" dur="3.659">raising better kids from the beginning</text><text start="214.319" dur="3.84">and what I came to learn is they were</text><text start="215.879" dur="3.301">all right right somebody else would be</text><text start="218.159" dur="2.701">everything you&apos;re saying is so</text><text start="219.18" dur="3.3">anthropocentric the key is the</text><text start="220.86" dur="2.879">environment because we&apos;re none of us are</text><text start="222.48" dur="2.7">anything without the environment like</text><text start="223.739" dur="3.241">you have to prioritize that everything</text><text start="225.18" dur="4.32">else doesn&apos;t matter that much and like</text><text start="226.98" dur="4.02">what is an economy like we can breathe</text><text start="229.5" dur="2.459">without money we can&apos;t breathe without</text><text start="231.0" dur="3.84">air</text><text start="231.959" dur="4.021">and so be less anthropocentric and focus</text><text start="234.84" dur="2.16">on the Integrity of the environment</text><text start="235.98" dur="6.2">because that&apos;s Upstream from everything</text><text start="237.0" dur="8.22">and so what I what I learned was</text><text start="242.18" dur="5.38">the answer to all of the problems is all</text><text start="245.22" dur="4.019">of the solutions</text><text start="247.56" dur="3.3">um there is not a theory of chains</text><text start="249.239" dur="3.301">there&apos;s an Ecology of theories of change</text><text start="250.86" dur="2.879">it&apos;s so often when someone says what is</text><text start="252.54" dur="4.919">the solution it sounds like someone&apos;s</text><text start="253.739" dur="5.22">saying like what species is the forest</text><text start="257.459" dur="4.261">like I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re even</text><text start="258.959" dur="4.561">asking like a forest is lots of species</text><text start="261.72" dur="3.3">lots and lots and if it&apos;s an old growth</text><text start="263.52" dur="3.66">forest it&apos;s even more complexly</text><text start="265.02" dur="3.84">interacting so what is the solution</text><text start="267.18" dur="3.54">there&apos;s not a solution there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="268.86" dur="4.14">things that need to happen so if</text><text start="270.72" dur="4.14">anything I want patterns of how to think</text><text start="273.0" dur="3.06">about it and I want Frameworks for how</text><text start="274.86" dur="2.82">to think about it and I don&apos;t want</text><text start="276.06" dur="2.76">people to attached to those Frameworks</text><text start="277.68" dur="2.1">because they&apos;ll be useful but also</text><text start="278.82" dur="4.86">limiting</text><text start="279.78" dur="6.0">and to realize the cultural aspects do</text><text start="283.68" dur="4.26">involve education and media and</text><text start="285.78" dur="4.62">parenting</text><text start="287.94" dur="5.34">religion and lots of other things and</text><text start="290.4" dur="4.38">the structure of cities and you know in</text><text start="293.28" dur="3.66">the political economy aspects involve</text><text start="294.78" dur="3.18">lots of things and so and</text><text start="296.94" dur="5.1">um</text><text start="297.96" dur="6.179">the getting past the zealotists and</text><text start="302.04" dur="4.98">reductionist focus and being able to get</text><text start="304.139" dur="4.321">how do all these things come together</text><text start="307.02" dur="5.119">is</text><text start="308.46" dur="3.679">key to understanding properly</text></transcript>
