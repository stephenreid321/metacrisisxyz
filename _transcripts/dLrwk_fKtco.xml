stock</text><text start="124.14" dur="7.02">Daniel I&apos;d like to start with you you&apos;re</text><text start="126.719" dur="8.341">an integral thinker and uh you saw</text><text start="131.16" dur="6.78">something that I could contribute to</text><text start="135.06" dur="6.0">your journey our journey by introducing</text><text start="137.94" dur="5.64">me to George Barron</text><text start="141.06" dur="5.52">um I know we had this meta crisis long</text><text start="143.58" dur="6.299">conversation but I would still like to</text><text start="146.58" dur="5.7">invite you to frame a little bit this</text><text start="149.879" dur="5.101">conversation from your own</text><text start="152.28" dur="7.08">um perspective so that we could then</text><text start="154.98" dur="6.119">dive into Gerard&apos;s contribution</text><text start="159.36" dur="2.64">or</text><text start="161.099" dur="3.241">um</text><text start="162.0" dur="4.2">yeah in that conversation that I really</text><text start="164.34" dur="5.039">enjoyed with you and maybe you can link</text><text start="166.2" dur="6.6">that in the uh show notes here also uh</text><text start="169.379" dur="5.281">we went in some depth into uh what we</text><text start="172.8" dur="3.96">call the meta crisis assessment and what</text><text start="174.66" dur="4.14">needs to happen so I won&apos;t redo that</text><text start="176.76" dur="3.78">here but just very briefly the concept</text><text start="178.8" dur="3.84">of the meta crisis is that there are a</text><text start="180.54" dur="4.64">lot of catastrophic and some even</text><text start="182.64" dur="5.28">existential risks facing Humanity</text><text start="185.18" dur="4.96">currently and in the you know years and</text><text start="187.92" dur="4.26">decades ahead that are novel that are</text><text start="190.14" dur="3.92">not things that were facing the world at</text><text start="192.18" dur="4.02">any time previously in human history</text><text start="194.06" dur="4.599">obviously the world has always been at</text><text start="196.2" dur="5.34">risk of super volcanoes and asteroids</text><text start="198.659" dur="5.701">and things like that but</text><text start="201.54" dur="5.04">um we were never at risk of AI</text><text start="204.36" dur="4.56">autonomous weapons issues or nuclear</text><text start="206.58" dur="3.84">winter or synthetic bio issues or</text><text start="208.92" dur="4.56">planetary boundaries those are things</text><text start="210.42" dur="6.06">that require uh both that require either</text><text start="213.48" dur="5.46">exponential Tech or at least very</text><text start="216.48" dur="4.56">powerful Tech like nuclear Tech or</text><text start="218.94" dur="5.579">industrial Tech multiplied by</text><text start="221.04" dur="4.74">Generations of cumulative effects and 8</text><text start="224.519" dur="3.78">billion people in the huge amount of</text><text start="225.78" dur="4.679">resource per capita that is going into</text><text start="228.299" dur="4.741">the world so rather than just look at</text><text start="230.459" dur="4.14">there&apos;s a climate crisis but there&apos;s a</text><text start="233.04" dur="4.259">lot of other environmental crises</text><text start="234.599" dur="5.64">there&apos;s ocean acidification from</text><text start="237.299" dur="5.961">both climate but also nitrogen Den zones</text><text start="240.239" dur="5.161">and phosphorus and overfishing and</text><text start="243.26" dur="3.94">microplastics and forever chemicals</text><text start="245.4" dur="4.74">there was just a</text><text start="247.2" dur="4.619">article published that the pfos and pfas</text><text start="250.14" dur="3.36">the fluorinated surfactants have passed</text><text start="251.819" dur="4.38">planetary boundaries as defined by the</text><text start="253.5" dur="5.34">EPA and other regulatory agencies in</text><text start="256.199" dur="4.801">rainwater all around the world</text><text start="258.84" dur="3.96">um you know like there&apos;s so many</text><text start="261.0" dur="3.54">environmental crises the planetary</text><text start="262.8" dur="4.74">boundary framework is a pretty</text><text start="264.54" dur="5.82">overarching framework to say for the</text><text start="267.54" dur="4.98">planet to continue to function well soil</text><text start="270.36" dur="4.08">and biodiversity and temperature and</text><text start="272.52" dur="3.959">many things have to stay within certain</text><text start="274.44" dur="5.28">ranges and we&apos;re getting very near as</text><text start="276.479" dur="4.981">the result of industrial technology or</text><text start="279.72" dur="5.039">cumulative effects over a few centuries</text><text start="281.46" dur="4.98">and the increasing Demand on those the</text><text start="284.759" dur="3.121">front side of the materials economy is</text><text start="286.44" dur="4.199">take stuff from nature faster than</text><text start="287.88" dur="5.819">nature can replenish it which looks like</text><text start="290.639" dur="6.241">deforestation demineralization soil loss</text><text start="293.699" dur="5.041">overfishing you know Etc and then turn</text><text start="296.88" dur="3.48">it into pollution and trash and waste</text><text start="298.74" dur="3.0">faster than nature can process it which</text><text start="300.36" dur="3.899">looks like all of the toxicity and</text><text start="301.74" dur="5.22">pollution issues to solve that we have</text><text start="304.259" dur="4.081">to go to a closed-loop materials economy</text><text start="306.96" dur="2.82">we&apos;re not taking stuff from nature or</text><text start="308.34" dur="4.02">putting stuff into nature faster than</text><text start="309.78" dur="4.38">natural process that&apos;s a humongous thing</text><text start="312.36" dur="4.08">that does not include all of the risks</text><text start="314.16" dur="3.42">we face because you can go closed loop</text><text start="316.44" dur="2.699">and that still doesn&apos;t mean we won&apos;t</text><text start="317.58" dur="4.86">have a nuclear clear War it still</text><text start="319.139" dur="5.881">doesn&apos;t mean that we don&apos;t create a</text><text start="322.44" dur="4.199">synthetic bio catastrophes either on</text><text start="325.02" dur="2.88">accident through lab leaks through gain</text><text start="326.639" dur="3.381">of function research and things like</text><text start="327.9" dur="5.28">that or intentionally through bioweapons</text><text start="330.02" dur="4.179">or issues associated with AI nanotech or</text><text start="333.18" dur="4.32">the</text><text start="334.199" dur="5.161">more advanced exponential Tech meaning</text><text start="337.5" dur="4.02">um distributed catastrophe weapons for</text><text start="339.36" dur="3.72">everyone in a phase where your own</text><text start="341.52" dur="3.72">weapons and cyber weapons don&apos;t take</text><text start="343.08" dur="4.8">State actors and we&apos;re because of</text><text start="345.24" dur="4.019">climate change migration which looks to</text><text start="347.88" dur="3.84">displace hundreds of millions of people</text><text start="349.259" dur="4.081">in the decade ahead you have a lot more</text><text start="351.72" dur="3.6">people who will be much more</text><text start="353.34" dur="3.78">disenfranchised who also have much more</text><text start="355.32" dur="3.54">access to do something about that that</text><text start="357.12" dur="3.72">is catastrophic so the world&apos;s fragile</text><text start="358.86" dur="5.46">for all of these reasons</text><text start="360.84" dur="4.32">so our basic premise is</text><text start="364.32" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="365.16" dur="5.34">we are in a phase where and they&apos;re all</text><text start="368.52" dur="3.959">the result of human technology and the</text><text start="370.5" dur="4.68">coordination systems because Stone Age</text><text start="372.479" dur="5.641">people just really can&apos;t cause</text><text start="375.18" dur="4.56">biological crisis at a planetary level</text><text start="378.12" dur="3.18">nor can they cause war that messes</text><text start="379.74" dur="3.6">everything up nor even externalities</text><text start="381.3" dur="4.26">that mess everything up so it really is</text><text start="383.34" dur="4.02">the result of technology and</text><text start="385.56" dur="2.759">coordination failures of managing the</text><text start="387.36" dur="2.88">technology</text><text start="388.319" dur="3.6">we&apos;re not going to regress to a low</text><text start="390.24" dur="3.299">technology Civilization so we have to</text><text start="391.919" dur="4.861">get the coordination down where we don&apos;t</text><text start="393.539" dur="5.401">cause uh excessive externalities in the</text><text start="396.78" dur="4.62">process of our technology</text><text start="398.94" dur="4.979">and that so that&apos;s solving the kind of</text><text start="401.4" dur="4.98">mistake problems and so that we don&apos;t</text><text start="403.919" dur="4.201">use our technology rivalously I.E</text><text start="406.38" dur="3.9">exponential Warfare towards each other</text><text start="408.12" dur="3.72">you could say all of the problems are</text><text start="410.28" dur="3.419">the result of harm that we cause</text><text start="411.84" dur="3.84">intentionally so conflict theory and</text><text start="413.699" dur="4.56">Harmony cause accidentally so kind of</text><text start="415.68" dur="4.32">mistake Theory and so but both mediated</text><text start="418.259" dur="4.081">by our degree of technological power so</text><text start="420.0" dur="4.38">at the level of coordination we have to</text><text start="422.34" dur="4.44">work on resolving underlying sources of</text><text start="424.38" dur="4.2">conflict and get better at anticipating</text><text start="426.78" dur="4.56">externalities and mistakes and being</text><text start="428.58" dur="4.679">able to internalize those</text><text start="431.34" dur="3.9">um your work through Club of Rome</text><text start="433.259" dur="6.66">obviously looks at things like the</text><text start="435.24" dur="6.66">limits of growth and uh how does a</text><text start="439.919" dur="3.421">civilization that has an exponential</text><text start="441.9" dur="3.48">growth requirement on the financial</text><text start="443.34" dur="3.54">system where each of those dollars are</text><text start="445.38" dur="3.0">bound to a materials economy in some</text><text start="446.88" dur="3.84">ways on a finite Planet keep running</text><text start="448.38" dur="4.98">forever and then also your work through</text><text start="450.72" dur="4.379">integral investing saying insofar as</text><text start="453.36" dur="3.959">most of the</text><text start="455.099" dur="3.301">dollars that represent choices in the</text><text start="457.319" dur="1.921">world are still moving through the</text><text start="458.4" dur="3.48">market</text><text start="459.24" dur="4.859">uh can we think about how we allocate</text><text start="461.88" dur="4.92">those dollars better and we&apos;re not just</text><text start="464.099" dur="5.341">looking like GDP by itself isn&apos;t a good</text><text start="466.8" dur="4.5">metric because obviously we know why we</text><text start="469.44" dur="3.36">thought GDP was a good metric but GDP</text><text start="471.3" dur="3.72">goes up during war and with addiction</text><text start="472.8" dur="4.86">and health issues lots of things</text><text start="475.02" dur="4.019">in the same way lowering CO2 by itself</text><text start="477.66" dur="3.96">isn&apos;t a good metric because I could</text><text start="479.039" dur="4.321">lower CO2 by planting a bunch of plants</text><text start="481.62" dur="3.06">using more nitrogen fertilizers that</text><text start="483.36" dur="3.959">cause runoff that cause dead zones and</text><text start="484.68" dur="4.739">oceans faster we need a complex set of</text><text start="487.319" dur="4.921">metrics that we look at in indices we</text><text start="489.419" dur="4.261">look at the integral framework</text><text start="492.24" dur="3.84">um so</text><text start="493.68" dur="4.859">in the entire meta crisis there</text><text start="496.08" dur="6.299">basically the framework we&apos;re proposing</text><text start="498.539" dur="6.301">is that all of those catastrophes</text><text start="502.379" dur="5.1">are design constraints that Humanity</text><text start="504.84" dur="3.96">must meet to have a civilization that</text><text start="507.479" dur="3.601">continues so if we take them all as</text><text start="508.8" dur="3.419">design constraints and simultaneously we</text><text start="511.08" dur="3.06">don&apos;t want the solution to the</text><text start="512.219" dur="3.421">catastrophes to be control mechanisms</text><text start="514.14" dur="4.019">that are so centralized that they create</text><text start="515.64" dur="5.94">dystopias so we want to avoid</text><text start="518.159" dur="5.281">catastrophes and avoid dystopias so our</text><text start="521.58" dur="4.08">Focus you know the kind of think tank</text><text start="523.44" dur="3.66">that we run our focus is how do we</text><text start="525.66" dur="3.9">create a third attractor that is neither</text><text start="527.1" dur="3.78">catastrophes neither dystopias what is a</text><text start="529.56" dur="3.959">necessary and sufficient set of</text><text start="530.88" dur="5.459">solutions to get there and that&apos;s a huge</text><text start="533.519" dur="3.661">topic and a lot of things are involved</text><text start="536.339" dur="2.581">um</text><text start="537.18" dur="4.62">and</text><text start="538.92" dur="4.859">so the reason I&apos;m interested in Gerard&apos;s</text><text start="541.8" dur="3.539">work and the work of uh middle school</text><text start="543.779" dur="2.881">and we&apos;ve been friends for some time now</text><text start="545.339" dur="2.761">I thought it&apos;d be an interesting</text><text start="546.66" dur="4.679">conversation for you guys to have and I</text><text start="548.1" dur="5.52">was happy to join it is</text><text start="551.339" dur="4.321">be</text><text start="553.62" dur="3.36">obviously climate change is one of the</text><text start="555.66" dur="2.58">major environmental issues we&apos;re facing</text><text start="556.98" dur="2.1">it&apos;s</text><text start="558.24" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="559.08" dur="6.54">it&apos;s a particularly hard one because if</text><text start="562.56" dur="5.339">we look at hfcs or CFCs causing ozone</text><text start="565.62" dur="4.62">issues or if we look at fluorinated</text><text start="567.899" dur="3.841">surfactants used for</text><text start="570.24" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="571.74" dur="4.92">uh you know Water Roofing things or</text><text start="574.26" dur="4.62">whatever you can or pesticides you can</text><text start="576.66" dur="3.84">potentially change that you have to</text><text start="578.88" dur="3.36">fight uphill against a multi-billion</text><text start="580.5" dur="3.6">dollar vested industry but you don&apos;t</text><text start="582.24" dur="2.76">have to fight a pill against industry</text><text start="584.1" dur="3.54">itself</text><text start="585.0" dur="5.16">whereas when CO2 as the byproduct of</text><text start="587.64" dur="4.319">burning hydrocarbons every single</text><text start="590.16" dur="4.02">industry requires energy and the</text><text start="591.959" dur="4.201">transition of the energy process itself</text><text start="594.18" dur="4.56">is more fundamental and deep than any</text><text start="596.16" dur="5.46">particular area so it&apos;s huge either we</text><text start="598.74" dur="4.68">figure out how to transition off</text><text start="601.62" dur="5.219">hydrocarbons and produce enough energy</text><text start="603.42" dur="5.94">well or we have massive problems</text><text start="606.839" dur="4.381">the transition off of hydrocarbons is</text><text start="609.36" dur="4.08">not trivial because if we make solar</text><text start="611.22" dur="3.42">cells and the associated battery packs</text><text start="613.44" dur="4.2">to deal with intermittency or whatever</text><text start="614.64" dur="5.34">else it takes a lot of hydrocarbons</text><text start="617.64" dur="4.08">to make those and that thing has to run</text><text start="619.98" dur="3.479">for 10 years or whatever it is to pay</text><text start="621.72" dur="3.119">that off base so the energy return on</text><text start="623.459" dur="3.601">energy investment so there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="624.839" dur="3.421">deep issues there I have a series with</text><text start="627.06" dur="3.36">Nate Higgins where we talk about those</text><text start="628.26" dur="6.06">things in depth so I won&apos;t get into them</text><text start="630.42" dur="5.76">too much depth here but I will say that</text><text start="634.32" dur="3.9">there is a very tight correlation</text><text start="636.18" dur="3.719">between Global GDP and Global energy use</text><text start="638.22" dur="3.72">it&apos;s been referred to as the Garrett</text><text start="639.899" dur="5.101">relation there are some critiques of</text><text start="641.94" dur="5.16">that specific formulation but from 1970</text><text start="645.0" dur="4.079">till now there&apos;s about a 99 correlation</text><text start="647.1" dur="4.2">between Global GDP and Global energy use</text><text start="649.079" dur="6.061">where all the efficiencies in technology</text><text start="651.3" dur="6.84">give you about one percent more

for</text><text start="769.92" dur="4.32">intermittency</text><text start="771.779" dur="4.201">so one of the issues becomes that for</text><text start="774.24" dur="4.2">environmental reasons we want to get off</text><text start="775.98" dur="4.02">hydrocarbons but there are environmental</text><text start="778.44" dur="3.839">things that there are things that have</text><text start="780.0" dur="3.48">environmental cost to do that like the</text><text start="782.279" dur="3.18">metals needed to make all those</text><text start="783.48" dur="3.359">batteries and the resources to make the</text><text start="785.459" dur="2.94">solar cells and the wind plants would</text><text start="786.839" dur="3.18">ever come from somewhere not only does</text><text start="788.399"

other</text><text start="793.56" dur="5.459">resources to do that thing</text><text start="796.139" dur="4.76">and so if we look at the need to get off</text><text start="799.019" dur="5.461">hydrocarbon fuels</text><text start="800.899" dur="6.101">combined with the knee the inability to</text><text start="804.48" dur="3.84">lower the energy demand significantly</text><text

dur="4.86">aren&apos;t addressed one of them is that to</text><text start="819.24" dur="3.599">Electrify the entire Transportation</text><text start="820.68" dur="4.8">Fleet is a big deal the

dur="4.56">electrifying all of the transport and</text><text start="881.1" dur="3.539">then the energy storage that is needed</text><text start="882.899" dur="3.24">for the electrification of the grid

dur="5.099">of those minerals from surface sources</text><text start="891.56" dur="4.12">environmentally has real problems</text><text start="893.639" dur="3.421">because a lot of those surface

a lot</text><text start="902.699" dur="3.721">of the</text><text start="903.74" dur="4.719">ore sources have a lot of unusable</text><text start="906.42" dur="3.359">co-product that turns into toxic

dur="3.541">are one of the major ones to hit so when</text><text start="913.5" dur="5.519">I met Gerard and heard about their</text><text start="914.82" dur="6.18">solution which I&apos;ll let him share</text><text start="919.019" dur="4.081">there were a number of things about it</text><text start="921.0" dur="4.5">that even though it hasn&apos;t some</text><text start="923.1" dur="4.44">environmental cost looking at the entire</text><text start="925.5" dur="3.959">life cycle of all of the environmental</text><text start="927.54" dur="3.599">costs and the trade-offs that we can&apos;t</text><text start="929.459" dur="3.12">avoid because there are very hard</text><text start="931.139" dur="3.601">trade-offs that you may have to face</text><text start="932.579" dur="4.56">seems like it is an important and</text><text start="934.74" dur="4.08">critical topic to get a lot more serious</text><text start="937.139" dur="5.041">attention and that&apos;s why I</text><text start="938.82" dur="7.079">um wanted to have the conversation</text><text start="942.18" dur="5.94">well brilliant so um Gerard you are the</text><text start="945.899" dur="3.961">CEO founder you&apos;re a Serial entrepreneur</text><text start="948.12" dur="4.26">first of all this is where we connected</text><text start="949.86" dur="7.14">to uh and you are the CEO and the</text><text start="952.38" dur="9.54">founder of the metals company and uh so</text><text start="957.0" dur="7.279">tell us you know tell us why why go the</text><text start="961.92" dur="2.359">hard way</text><text start="964.38" dur="5.759">you&apos;re right Ariana it is the hard way</text><text start="966.839" dur="7.021">because getting a new extractive</text><text start="970.139" dur="5.82">industry uh established at a time where</text><text start="973.86" dur="4.919">the world is focused on the impact of</text><text start="975.959" dur="5.88">all extractive Industries is well it&apos;s a</text><text start="978.779" dur="5.761">little counter-intuitive and so what we</text><text start="981.839" dur="4.68">did is we looked at you know accepting</text><text start="984.54" dur="4.919">the fact that the world is going to need</text><text start="986.519" dur="5.161">a lot more metal and I think that is on</text><text start="989.459" dur="4.56">indisputable if we look at the</text><text start="991.68" dur="4.74">International Energy agency you know</text><text start="994.019" dur="4.26">they say by 2040 we&apos;ll need between five</text><text start="996.42" dur="4.919">and six hundred percent more of these</text><text start="998.279" dur="5.541">medals to meet the energy needs for the</text><text start="1001.339" dur="6.06">the transition so accepting that fact</text><text start="1003.82" dur="5.379">then we put through the lens of well</text><text start="1007.399" dur="3.601">where where can they come from you know</text><text start="1009.199" dur="4.921">where is the right place to be looking</text><text start="1011.0" dur="5.279">for these metals and with the lightest</text><text start="1014.12" dur="5.88">planetary and human touch</text><text start="1016.279" dur="7.92">and we came to the conclusion that the</text><text start="1020.0" dur="6.9">the absolute winner in that race was</text><text start="1024.199" dur="5.521">these uh like I have in my hand and this</text><text start="1026.9" dur="6.299">being a poly metallic nodule and of</text><text start="1029.72" dur="6.9">course we know that 70 of the planet is</text><text start="1033.199" dur="6.12">covered in Ocean and and this is why it</text><text start="1036.62" dur="5.579">was so interesting to to blend your</text><text start="1039.319" dur="4.86">integral thinking into this because we</text><text start="1042.199" dur="4.5">can&apos;t look at the ocean without looking</text><text start="1044.179" dur="4.801">at land in packs and we can&apos;t be looking</text><text start="1046.699" dur="4.621">at Landing packs without looking at the</text><text start="1048.98" dur="5.46">entire impact of to our planet and so</text><text start="1051.32" dur="5.04">what we started our work on was</text><text start="1054.44" dur="3.78">identifying you know what are the</text><text start="1056.36" dur="3.6">impacts of collecting this resource and</text><text start="1058.22" dur="3.48">turning it into battery metals and if</text><text start="1059.96" dur="4.68">you if you go back to our purpose which</text><text start="1061.7" dur="5.46">we published many years ago it came in</text><text start="1064.64" dur="5.7">three steps and one was to identify</text><text start="1067.16" dur="7.259">where are the lowest impact supply of</text><text start="1070.34" dur="6.42">these battery metals to be found and we</text><text start="1074.419" dur="5.041">decided that this was the resource to</text><text start="1076.76" dur="4.4">investigate further and and because we</text><text start="1079.46" dur="5.4">don&apos;t have enough Metals in the system</text><text start="1081.16" dur="6.46">to allow a pathway to circularity</text><text start="1084.86" dur="5.58">because we do believe that circularity</text><text start="1087.62" dur="5.1">in the long run will reduce the demand</text><text start="1090.44" dur="5.22">for Virgin oils and so that&apos;s where we</text><text start="1092.72" dur="5.16">need to get to so but step one was to</text><text start="1095.66" dur="5.58">get the lowest impact from a planetary</text><text start="1097.88" dur="5.36">environmental and human perspective of</text><text start="1101.24" dur="5.22">supply of these Metals into the system</text><text start="1103.24" dur="5.679">and step two of our purpose was then to</text><text start="1106.46" dur="5.579">make sure every single atom that we put</text><text start="1108.919" dur="5.88">into the system stayed there and Daniel</text><text start="1112.039" dur="5.041">coined the phase phrase atoms as a</text><text start="1114.799" dur="3.481">service meaning let&apos;s put the metals in</text><text start="1117.08" dur="4.38">there but let&apos;s make sure we get them</text><text start="1118.28" dur="5.639">back and we can recycle them and and</text><text start="1121.46" dur="4.98">um and make sure that they can stay</text><text start="1123.919" dur="4.321">there for many millions of years to come</text><text start="1126.44" dur="5.64">and then finally when extracted</text><text start="1128.24" dur="6.179">Industries uh slow down because stage</text><text start="1132.08" dur="4.86">two has been so successful and we are in</text><text start="1134.419" dur="4.26">a circular economy to make sure that we</text><text start="1136.94" dur="3.96">can repurpose our land-based</text><text start="1138.679" dur="4.62">infrastructure to recycle other</text><text start="1140.9" dur="4.86">materials because these nodules are</text><text start="1143.299" dur="5.101">abundant in nickel which is a really</text><text start="1145.76" dur="4.86">important metal for our future copper</text><text start="1148.4" dur="4.5">Cobalt and manganese but of course there</text><text start="1150.62" dur="3.96">are many other metals that don&apos;t have</text><text start="1152.9" dur="4.019">the same</text><text start="1154.58" dur="4.26">um well aren&apos;t for aren&apos;t the focus of</text><text start="1156.919" dur="4.62">recycling at the moment but they will be</text><text start="1158.84" dur="6.0">as we head towards circularity</text><text start="1161.539" dur="5.52">so that&apos;s where we started and the the</text><text start="1164.84" dur="4.92">beauty when we look at this all body</text><text start="1167.059" dur="4.74">um and the reason why it&apos;s a little bit</text><text start="1169.76" dur="5.159">it takes a bit of adjustment is is of</text><text start="1171.799" dur="6.601">course you know if you look at 70 of the</text><text start="1174.919" dur="6.181">planet is Ocean and the Abyssal zone is</text><text start="1178.4" dur="5.94">by far the most common environment on</text><text start="1181.1" dur="6.66">our planet it&apos;s an area at about almost</text><text start="1184.34" dur="5.459">4 000 meters and Beyond below seawater</text><text start="1187.76" dur="4.74">and</text><text start="1189.799" dur="4.801">this is where these nodules lie and they</text><text start="1192.5" dur="3.78">literally form by precipitating the</text><text start="1194.6" dur="4.319">metals that are in the sea water or the</text><text start="1196.28" dur="5.519">sediment upon which they sit so they</text><text start="1198.919" dur="6.601">grow a little bit like a pearl Grows by</text><text start="1201.799" dur="7.38">precipitating those metals and and the</text><text start="1205.52" dur="6.24">beauty of that of course is that we when</text><text start="1209.179" dur="4.74">we move them to shore to process them</text><text start="1211.76" dur="5.46">um we kind of reverse that process and</text><text start="1213.919" dur="5.941">we can turn 100 of the mass of this</text><text start="1217.22" dur="5.579">nodule in my hand into usable</text><text start="1219.86" dur="6.12">salable material and that means we</text><text start="1222.799" dur="5.341">generate no waste like zero waste and</text><text start="1225.98" dur="4.26">zero tailings and that&apos;s a real game</text><text start="1228.14" dur="5.58">changer for the mining and metals</text><text start="1230.24" dur="4.76">industry because last year about</text><text start="1233.72" dur="4.199">um</text><text start="1235.0" dur="5.74">190 billion tons of waste was generated</text><text start="1237.919" dur="5.401">by the mining industry globally and put</text><text start="1240.74" dur="5.4">that in context about 2 billion tons of</text><text start="1243.32" dur="5.52">waste was generated municipally globally</text><text start="1246.14" dur="5.94">so waste is a really important problem</text><text start="1248.84" dur="6.959">and if you go to increase that by five</text><text start="1252.08" dur="5.4">or six x then an even bigger problem</text><text start="1255.799" dur="4.62">but</text><text start="1257.48" dur="5.16">Mother Nature did us at an amazing thing</text><text start="1260.419" dur="3.481">by where they located these nodules in</text><text start="1262.64" dur="4.5">the Abyssal Stone and they literally</text><text start="1263.9" dur="6.12">just lie there on the ocean floor and so</text><text start="1267.14" dur="4.919">to extract them it means we have to pick</text><text start="1270.02" dur="6.0">them up off the surface and we&apos;ve just</text><text start="1272.059" dur="6.62">completed a very important set of Trials</text><text start="1276.02" dur="5.34">um our company has been around for</text><text start="1278.679" dur="6.88">around 12 years</text><text start="1281.36" dur="6.3">um but we&apos;re working towards the permit</text><text start="1285.559" dur="5.221">to be able to move from exploration</text><text start="1287.66" dur="4.92">phase to extraction phase and so an</text><text start="1290.78" dur="4.2">important part of that were some trials</text><text start="1292.58" dur="4.5">that we completed last year where we had</text><text start="1294.98" dur="4.559">our first production system on our</text><text start="1297.08" dur="6.12">license area so we could we could test</text><text start="1299.539" dur="5.461">our our production means by which we</text><text start="1303.2" dur="3.9">lift these nodules</text><text start="1305.0" dur="4.679">um pump them to the production vessel</text><text start="1307.1" dur="4.079">and then we&apos;ll move them ashore for</text><text start="1309.679" dur="2.941">processing to turn them into battery</text><text start="1311.179" dur="3.781">Metals</text><text start="1312.62" dur="6.96">um but what we were very encouraged by</text><text start="1314.96" dur="7.079">was we had two vessels one one was a 240</text><text start="1319.58" dur="4.86">meter production vessel known as The</text><text start="1322.039" dur="4.081">Hidden Gem and it was it was the one</text><text start="1324.44" dur="5.34">that drove the robot on the sea floor</text><text start="1326.12" dur="6.0">and um and it was engineered by one of</text><text start="1329.78" dur="7.32">our big investors and partners all C&apos;s</text><text start="1332.12" dur="7.38">who have for the last 37 years been very</text><text start="1337.1" dur="5.16">successful in the pipeline industry for</text><text start="1339.5" dur="4.14">the oil and gas world and and so a lot</text><text start="1342.26" dur="3.779">of expertise</text><text start="1343.64" dur="5.159">from that industry is coming to help us</text><text start="1346.039" dur="5.401">move this industry past the experimental</text><text start="1348.799" dur="4.62">phase into the production phase and and</text><text start="1351.44" dur="4.58">they did an amazing job and it was a</text><text start="1353.419" dur="5.161">wildly successful campaign so we&apos;re very</text><text start="1356.02" dur="4.84">relieved and pleased about that but we</text><text start="1358.58" dur="4.56">had a second vessel out there and it was</text><text start="1360.86" dur="4.5">science focused we had many scientists</text><text start="1363.14" dur="4.019">on the Hidden Gem as well but but that</text><text start="1365.36" dur="4.5">second vessel was purely there for</text><text start="1367.159" dur="6.0">monitoring and so we were surveying the</text><text start="1369.86" dur="6.299">area before we touched it during the</text><text start="1373.159" dur="5.581">collection phase and then post the</text><text start="1376.159" dur="4.561">collection phase and you know that was</text><text start="1378.74" dur="4.799">an important part because the results of</text><text start="1380.72" dur="5.579">that work will go into our application</text><text start="1383.539" dur="4.02">that we plan to submit to the the</text><text start="1386.299" dur="3.181">regulator who is the international</text><text start="1387.559" dur="3.781">seabed Authority</text><text start="1389.48" dur="4.319">um and will be an important part of the</text><text start="1391.34" dur="4.68">environmental impact study to look at</text><text start="1393.799" dur="3.721">the impact of picking these up and and</text><text start="1396.02" dur="2.88">I&apos;m pleased to say</text><text start="1397.52" dur="2.94">um you know the things that we worry</text><text start="1398.9" dur="3.36">about are</text><text start="1400.46" dur="4.38">you know well what&apos;s the impact of</text><text start="1402.26" dur="4.5">removing them on biodiversity you know</text><text start="1404.84" dur="3.78">will there be uh loss and how do we</text><text start="1406.76" dur="4.32">mitigate that what would be the impact</text><text start="1408.62" dur="5.22">of the the dust that we generate on the</text><text start="1411.08" dur="4.32">sea floor people notice the plume uh how</text><text start="1413.84" dur="3.839">can we mitigate that how far will it</text><text start="1415.4" dur="4.259">travel think of it as driving a car down</text><text start="1417.679" dur="3.721">a dirt road you&apos;ll you&apos;ll kick up some</text><text start="1419.659" dur="4.441">dust but how far will that dust travel</text><text start="1421.4" dur="6.18">and then the third thing is where to</text><text start="1424.1" dur="5.819">reinject the um the water that we bring</text><text start="1427.58" dur="4.56">up from the seafloor because we separate</text><text start="1429.919" dur="5.281">the sediment from the nodules at the</text><text start="1432.14" dur="4.8">robot but we have to use water to as the</text><text start="1435.2" dur="3.9">transport mechanism and then we have to</text><text start="1436.94" dur="5.16">return that water somewhere</text><text start="1439.1" dur="4.52">um but if I was to to put that into two</text><text start="1442.1" dur="4.14">categories you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="1443.62" dur="6.76">biodiversity and you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="1446.24" dur="6.48">plume and you know speculation by some</text><text start="1450.38" dur="6.06">people was that this plume would travel</text><text start="1452.72" dur="5.579">for large distances and would have a you</text><text start="1456.44" dur="3.84">know a negative impact on the</text><text start="1458.299" dur="5.581">surroundings of the ocean as thousands</text><text start="1460.28" dur="5.82">of miles away but our results were very</text><text start="1463.88" dur="5.94">consistent with the results that MIT</text><text start="1466.1" dur="5.459">published some months ago from a a very</text><text start="1469.82" dur="4.62">extensive campaign that they were</text><text start="1471.559" dur="5.281">monitoring a year earlier and that is</text><text start="1474.44" dur="5.28">that the plume only Rose about two</text><text start="1476.84" dur="6.06">meters above the sea floor and most of</text><text start="1479.72" dur="5.76">it like up to 98 of it stayed in the the</text><text start="1482.9" dur="4.92">test area and so that&apos;s good news and it</text><text start="1485.48" dur="4.38">was what we always believed but of</text><text start="1487.82" dur="4.02">course science has to provide the</text><text start="1489.86" dur="3.059">evidence to be able to make these</text><text start="1491.84" dur="5.1">decisions</text><text start="1492.919" dur="5.88">so now of course we have uh we&apos;ve been</text><text start="1496.94" dur="4.38">gathering this environmental data</text><text start="1498.799" dur="4.86">including Baseline data for many many</text><text start="1501.32" dur="4.44">years and so now the job is to put all</text><text start="1503.659" dur="8.941">the results of that</text><text start="1505.76" dur="9.779">um into a coherent uh study and put to</text><text start="1512.6" dur="5.459">extrapolate those results into more of a</text><text start="1515.539" dur="4.5">production type environment as well and</text><text start="1518.059" dur="4.321">then to submit that as part of our</text><text start="1520.039" dur="4.861">application to move from exploration</text><text start="1522.38" dur="4.5">into a phase that we&apos;re we&apos;re able to</text><text start="1524.9" dur="4.019">lift the nodules and move them to Shore</text><text start="1526.88" dur="4.86">and process them and and sell the</text><text start="1528.919" dur="5.041">results and and so you know we&apos;ve always</text><text start="1531.74" dur="6.36">believed that we can</text><text start="1533.96" dur="6.839">compress the range of impacts by very</text><text start="1538.1" dur="5.16">significant amounts and we&apos;ve been</text><text start="1540.799" dur="5.941">funding a lot of research to that point</text><text start="1543.26" dur="5.22">we have had many articles appear in</text><text start="1546.74" dur="4.2">peer-reviewed journals like the the</text><text start="1548.48" dur="5.16">Journal of cleaner production that</text><text start="1550.94" dur="5.46">published our CO2 paper that said showed</text><text start="1553.64" dur="4.68">that you can reduce CO2 emissions by</text><text start="1556.4" dur="4.32">more than 90 percent when you build a</text><text start="1558.32" dur="4.82">battery cathode using these rocks</text><text start="1560.72" dur="5.16">compared to the land-based Alternatives</text><text start="1563.14" dur="5.44">the fact that we can generate no

for the nickel product I</text><text start="1586.46" dur="4.199">mentioned nickel is very important about</text><text start="1588.5" dur="3.72">half of the economics come from nickel</text><text start="1590.659" dur="4.201">and</text><text start="1592.22" dur="5.88">if you look at the supply of nickel</text><text start="1594.86" dur="4.98">globally it&apos;s declining the growth in</text><text start="1598.1" dur="2.699">nickel is coming from Indonesia and</text><text start="1599.84" dur="3.78">that&apos;s in the form of these</text><text start="1600.799" dur="4.441">nickelaterates since the you know you</text><text start="1603.62" dur="4.2">can see a green picture behind me on the</text><text start="1605.24" dur="6.48">wall or it&apos;s actually a moss wall but</text><text start="1607.82" dur="7.26">imagine that is a a very biodiverse</text><text start="1611.72" dur="5.22">rainforest in Indonesia and under it</text><text start="1615.08" dur="4.199">lies a lot of nickel so to get to that</text><text start="1616.94" dur="3.96">nickel you&apos;ve got to build a heap of</text><text start="1619.279" dur="3.661">infrastructure you&apos;re going to go in and</text><text start="1620.9" dur="4.44">tear down the rainforest and move all</text><text start="1622.94" dur="5.4">the topsoil all of which of course means</text><text start="1625.34" dur="6.3">destroying carbon sinks you then need to</text><text start="1628.34" dur="5.219">to dig up this nickel lateride ore</text><text start="1631.64" dur="4.139">unfortunately when you expose it to</text><text start="1633.559" dur="4.141">weather the runoff is chromium six plus</text><text start="1635.779" dur="4.741">which of course poisons everything in</text><text

material is usable the other 90</text><text start="1646.039" dur="4.5">plus percent of it is waste and you have</text><text start="1648.44" dur="4.5">to do something with that waste and it&apos;s</text><text start="1650.539" dur="4.26">not just any old waste it&apos;s toxic waste</text><text start="1652.94" dur="5.7">so you can&apos;t you know you have to treat</text><text

that&apos;s why we have to</text><text start="1662.84" dur="4.68">be looking at New Frontiers because</text><text start="1665.14" dur="5.019">turning a blind eye to the current</text><text

our planet we do have to</text><text start="1688.76" dur="4.32">worry about it and we have to be looking</text><text start="1690.26" dur="4.86">through the lens of you know a full life</text><text start="1693.08" dur="4.44">cycle analysis and say well what are</text><text start="1695.12" dur="3.9">what are these set of broad impacts and</text><text start="1697.52" dur="3.72">how do they compare to the Alternatives</text><text start="1699.02" dur="4.68">and then we have some judgments to make</text><text start="1701.24" dur="4.319">you know and the judgments are do we</text><text start="1703.7" dur="3.78">want to keep destroying the most</text><text start="1705.559" dur="4.321">biodiverse carbon sinks on our planet</text><text start="1707.48" dur="4.62">you know robbing

and look for</text><text start="1720.2" dur="4.38">something that is a whole lot you know</text><text start="1722.539" dur="4.701">better for our planet and for the humans</text><text start="1724.58"

is</text><text start="1745.039" dur="5.161">in the in the waters of the Republic of</text><text start="1747.26" dur="5.24">now is that correct no no we&apos;re actually</text><text start="1750.2" dur="5.339">in international waters</text><text start="1752.5" dur="6.7">now rules are public is our sponsor</text><text start="1755.539" dur="6.301">because right we wind our mind back 50</text><text start="1759.2" dur="3.599">years ago this industry almost got</text><text start="1761.84" dur="2.64">started</text><text start="1762.799" dur="4.821">um there were four different

dur="2.76">they started to put</text><text start="1773.48" dur="3.179">um</text><text start="1774.559" dur="4.081">efforts together to collect these rocks</text><text start="1776.659" dur="4.861">and they were successful it was really</text><text start="1778.64" dur="4.5">pioneering stuff I mean we&apos;ve just had a</text><text start="1781.52" dur="3.12">very successful trial but we&apos;ve</text><text start="1783.14" dur="3.48">benefited from the development of the</text><text start="1784.64" dur="4.08">offshore industry and all the</text><text start="1786.62" dur="5.22">engineering advancement in the last 50</text><text start="1788.72" dur="4.98">years but 50 years ago they built the</text><text start="1791.84" dur="5.4">system and the robots to go down and</text><text start="1793.7" dur="5.28">Hoover these up and Rio Tinto build a</text><text start="1797.24" dur="4.14">processing plant on Shore it was all</text><text start="1798.98" dur="4.679">successful but but the problem is 50</text><text start="1801.38" dur="4.5">years ago the world had not agreed who</text><text start="1803.659" dur="6.061">owned the oceans where do my borders</text><text start="1805.88" dur="5.519">begin and end and so it was when Henry</text><text start="1809.72" dur="5.579">Kissinger wrote a letter to all of the</text><text start="1811.399" dur="6.601">ambassadors of the UN saying uh we&apos;d</text><text start="1815.299" dur="4.561">like to lay claim over this area it&apos;ll</text><text start="1818.0" dur="3.72">be good for the world trust us on that</text><text start="1819.86" dur="5.28">of course all the ambassadors got</text><text start="1821.72" dur="6.0">together and said that doesn&apos;t sound too</text><text start="1825.14" dur="4.74">Equitable and and so the UN stopped it</text><text start="1827.72" dur="5.22">so everyone had to pause and then that</text><text start="1829.88" dur="5.64">was agreed finally on where the borders</text><text start="1832.94" dur="4.44">begin and end when unclosed which stands</text><text start="1835.52" dur="4.8">for the United Nations Convention of the</text><text start="1837.38" dur="5.34">law of the sea was put into place in</text><text start="1840.32" dur="4.32">1982 and that basically said as a</text><text start="1842.72" dur="4.62">sovereign you own everything within 12</text><text start="1844.64" dur="4.8">miles of your Coastline and you have an</text><text start="1847.34" dur="5.28">economic right to everything within 200</text><text start="1849.44" dur="4.859">miles but beyond that it&apos;s not yours in</text><text start="1852.62" dur="3.659">fact it&apos;s everybody&apos;s it&apos;s deemed the</text><text start="1854.299"

international</text><text start="1861.14" dur="4.74">waters but but to be able to claim an</text><text start="1863.72" dur="3.78">area you either need to be a signatory</text><text start="1865.88" dur="3.72">to one class and a member of the</text><text start="1867.5" dur="5.279">international seabed Authority which we</text><text start="1869.6" dur="4.98">are not or be sponsored by a member

well</text><text start="1890.179" dur="3.901">what happened there whereas this is a</text><text start="1892.22" dur="3.48">way that a developing nation in our case</text><text start="1894.08" dur="3.599">nauru</text><text start="1895.7" dur="4.14">um we also have a similar relationship</text><text start="1897.679" dur="4.261">with the Kingdom of Tonga and kirivas</text><text

really getting</text><text start="1967.279" dur="4.5">a fuller picture here I addressed many</text><text start="1970.159" dur="3.481">of the key issues around an</text><text start="1971.779" dur="5.0">environmental impact assessment with the</text><text start="1973.64" dur="6.36">eia and there&apos;s also the impact of sound</text><text start="1976.779" dur="5.26">uh in terms of the

just</text><text start="1994.94" dur="3.959">looking only to comply with what&apos;s</text><text start="1996.62" dur="4.26">expected in order to get a license where</text><text start="1998.899" dur="3.9">we&apos;re actually advocating for higher</text><text start="2000.88" dur="4.26">standards and we&apos;re really willing to</text><text start="2002.799" dur="5.941">use ourselves here as a case study to</text><text start="2005.14" dur="5.1">then educating inform others of how we</text><text start="2008.74" dur="3.84">can do this in a way that is</text><text start="2010.24" dur="4.98">regenerative and it&apos;s the least amount</text><text start="2012.58" dur="5.16">of impact with that big a planetary</text><text start="2015.22" dur="6.24">Vision that you you know describe so</text><text start="2017.74" dur="6.6">well no great questions uh on the topic</text><text start="2021.46" dur="6.66">of sound you know we&apos;ve run a very</text><text start="2024.34" dur="5.76">extensive sound uh campaign with our</text><text start="2028.12" dur="5.22">trials that have just recently completed</text><text start="2030.1" dur="6.24">and so we we look forward to publishing</text><text start="2033.34" dur="6.42">the results early indications are that</text><text start="2036.34" dur="6.439">they&apos;re all very manageable most of the</text><text start="2039.76" dur="5.58">sound of course happens on the surface</text><text start="2042.779" dur="5.441">but there is you know there&apos;s noise</text><text start="2045.34" dur="4.799">generated by the transportation of</text><text start="2048.22" dur="4.56">nodules up the pipe and but there are</text><text start="2050.139" dur="4.921">there are there are means that we can</text><text start="2052.78" dur="5.96">dampen that noise substantially if</text><text start="2055.06" dur="6.119">required but as it stands now</text><text start="2058.74" dur="4.48">we&apos;re very encouraged by the results</text><text start="2061.179" dur="4.68">that we&apos;ve seen from those recent trials</text><text start="2063.22" dur="4.32">and so we don&apos;t think noise just just</text><text start="2065.859" dur="3.421">remember we&apos;re not breaking anything on</text><text start="2067.54" dur="4.02">the sea floor like these nodules</text><text start="2069.28" dur="4.2">literally lie there so as long as though</text><text start="2071.56" dur="4.319">we&apos;re having to drill or blast which is</text><text start="2073.48" dur="4.139">conventionally what happens you know in</text><text start="2075.879" dur="5.821">the oil and gas or the mining industry</text><text start="2077.619" dur="7.381">and so you know very different scenario</text><text start="2081.7" dur="4.56">um so going back on to the path that we</text><text start="2085.0" dur="4.32">took</text><text start="2086.26" dur="7.22">I think it&apos;s really important for people</text><text start="2089.32" dur="4.16">to understand one thing</text><text start="2093.639" dur="6.601">never before has an industry had so much</text><text start="2097.48" dur="5.34">Focus before it got started by a</text><text start="2100.24" dur="5.34">regulator like normally Industries get</text><text start="2102.82" dur="6.06">started and then people try and regulate</text><text start="2105.58" dur="6.3">them so here we are the international</text><text start="2108.88" dur="5.36">seabed Authority it&apos;s made up of 167</text><text start="2111.88" dur="6.239">member countries plus the

start="2120.7" dur="5.22">Greenpeace and you had to imagine</text><text start="2123.52" dur="4.26">had to imagine a regulatory environment</text><text start="2125.92" dur="3.659">I imagine you&apos;d probably say it&apos;s</text><text start="2127.78" dur="3.78">something like this</text><text start="2129.579" dur="4.5">now of course they&apos;ll probably say it&apos;s</text><text start="2131.56" dur="4.86">not quite good enough but today but but</text><text start="2134.079" dur="3.721">never before has an industry had so much</text><text start="2136.42" dur="3.06">Focus</text><text start="2137.8" dur="3.9">before it&apos;s got started so that&apos;s</text><text start="2139.48" dur="6.359">encouraging but the other thing I&apos;d like</text><text start="2141.7" dur="7.02">to make the point of is that don&apos;t think</text><text start="2145.839" dur="4.681">if it doesn&apos;t happen under the control</text><text start="2148.72" dur="3.66">of the regulator</text><text start="2150.52" dur="5.94">the international seabed Authority don&apos;t</text><text start="2152.38" dur="6.959">think these assets won&apos;t be exploited</text><text start="2156.46" dur="5.639">and that&apos;s the opportunity for the world</text><text start="2159.339" dur="4.861">today the fact that you&apos;ve got a</text><text start="2162.099" dur="4.341">regulator in place</text><text start="2164.2" dur="4.86">and the fact that you&apos;ve got a company</text><text start="2166.44" dur="4.84">like ourselves I&apos;d like to say we&apos;re</text><text start="2169.06" dur="4.44">really responsible corporate citizen</text><text start="2171.28" dur="5.819">we&apos;ve there are guidelines that have</text><text start="2173.5" dur="5.22">been laid down by the regulator on what</text><text start="2177.099" dur="4.321">we should be looking at from an</text><text start="2178.72" dur="4.26">Environmental Management perspective</text><text start="2181.42" dur="4.26">because the Mandate of the international</text><text start="2182.98" dur="4.74">seabed Authority is really clear it&apos;s to</text><text start="2185.68" dur="4.26">put in place exploration and</text><text start="2187.72" dur="4.68">exploitation regulations</text><text start="2189.94" dur="4.5">a term that&apos;s adopted from the</text><text start="2192.4" dur="5.12">land-based mining industry while</text><text start="2194.44" dur="6.06">protecting the marine environment and so</text><text start="2197.52" dur="6.46">we they provide very strong guidance on</text><text start="2200.5" dur="6.0">what should happen but we always said we</text><text start="2203.98" dur="5.76">actually want to see that and up at</text><text start="2206.5" dur="6.66">another level and the good news there is</text><text start="2209.74" dur="6.42">that when you set a standard then</text><text start="2213.16" dur="7.439">generally that becomes a level that</text><text start="2216.16" dur="7.5">people have to attain or exceed and so I</text><text start="2220.599" dur="5.641">think it&apos;s really a positive thing that</text><text start="2223.66" dur="4.699">a we have a regulator that everyone&apos;s</text><text start="2226.24" dur="5.42">playing by the rule book at the moment</text><text start="2228.359" dur="4.861">and secondly that companies like us are</text><text start="2231.66" dur="5.08">striving</text><text start="2233.22" dur="5.92">towards Excellence you know when we put</text><text start="2236.74" dur="6.06">together our environmental</text><text start="2239.14" dur="5.12">um plan we didn&apos;t go and hire a heap of</text><text start="2242.8" dur="4.319">scientists so it could be company</text><text start="2244.26" dur="5.8">prepared we went and sought the very</text><text start="2247.119" dur="5.101">best experts from each discipline</text><text start="2250.06" dur="3.84">and so we have</text><text start="2252.22" dur="3.72">you know if you go to our website you&apos;ll</text><text start="2253.9" dur="4.56">see the array of Institutions and</text><text start="2255.94" dur="4.8">universities we have you know MIT</text><text start="2258.46" dur="4.92">helping us we have the University of</text><text start="2260.74" dur="5.339">Hawaii we have the national oceanography</text><text start="2263.38" dur="4.8">Center the Natural History Museum it&apos;s a</text><text start="2266.079" dur="4.26">really broad range of leading</text><text start="2268.18" dur="5.22">institutions who have put their</text><text start="2270.339" dur="6.061">expertise and with the help of our money</text><text start="2273.4" dur="5.64">I mean by the time we complete this we</text><text start="2276.4" dur="4.14">will have spent uh over 100 million</text><text start="2279.04" dur="3.78">dollars I mean it&apos;s a lot of money we&apos;ve</text><text start="2280.54" dur="4.5">invested in this it&apos;s the largest fully</text><text start="2282.82" dur="4.38">integrated you know ocean research</text><text start="2285.04" dur="5.34">research program ever done</text><text start="2287.2" dur="5.639">and so you know we did that because we</text><text start="2290.38" dur="3.84">we we knew that people would say ah yeah</text><text start="2292.839" dur="4.201">but you did it the metals company</text><text start="2294.22" dur="4.68">whereas we can say uh hang on yeah we</text><text start="2297.04" dur="4.74">bought expertise in from all of these</text><text start="2298.9" dur="4.679">very upstanding institutions who</text><text start="2301.78" dur="3.48">um you know have done the work</text><text start="2303.579" dur="3.361">independently they&apos;re free to publish</text><text start="2305.26" dur="5.0">their results you know we don&apos;t put any</text><text start="2306.94" dur="6.78">handcuffs on anyone we now have the</text><text start="2310.26" dur="5.859">csiro and uh the equivalent agency in</text><text start="2313.72" dur="4.859">New Zealand working with us on putting</text><text start="2316.119" dur="4.081">together an Adaptive management plan and</text><text start="2318.579" dur="4.981">that&apos;s going to be exciting too because</text><text start="2320.2" dur="5.34">their recently completed work uh on the</text><text start="2323.56" dur="4.14">Great Barrier Reef is there for everyone</text><text start="2325.54" dur="4.62">to see it&apos;s amazing the rehabilitation</text><text start="2327.7" dur="4.08">that is happening because there&apos;s so</text><text start="2330.16" dur="3.72">many things to worry about but what are</text><text start="2331.78" dur="6.12">the important things to worry about and</text><text start="2333.88" dur="6.0">so you know what csiro and and and then</text><text start="2337.9" dur="4.92">the equivalent agency in New Zealand are</text><text start="2339.88" dur="4.86">helping us with is is deciding what are</text><text start="2342.82" dur="4.44">the things to measure what are the the</text><text start="2344.74" dur="5.06">boundaries that we need to be mindful of</text><text start="2347.26" dur="6.42">we move through the production process</text><text start="2349.8" dur="6.88">so so I&apos;d like to think you know we took</text><text start="2353.68" dur="6.06">a set of guiding principles and we</text><text start="2356.68" dur="4.62">improved on them and you know knowing</text><text start="2359.74" dur="3.9">that we&apos;re going to have the eyes of the</text><text start="2361.3" dur="4.44">world focused on us which is something</text><text start="2363.64" dur="4.56">we&apos;re very very comfortable with and and</text><text start="2365.74" dur="5.42">you know that adaptive management system</text><text start="2368.2" dur="5.7">we we pair it with our digital twin</text><text start="2371.16" dur="4.3">because I sometimes hear people say well</text><text start="2373.9" dur="4.86">how on Earth will we know what you&apos;re</text><text start="2375.46" dur="5.52">doing a thousand miles offshore 4 000</text><text start="2378.76" dur="4.02">meters below sea level</text><text start="2380.98" dur="4.44">we won&apos;t know what&apos;s going on there but</text><text start="2382.78" dur="4.5">but it&apos;s the exact opposite I don&apos;t know</text><text start="2385.42" dur="3.419">whether you&apos;ve ever tried to get near a</text><text start="2387.28" dur="3.839">land-based mind but it&apos;s impossible</text><text start="2388.839" dur="4.921">you&apos;re met with barbed wire and machine</text><text start="2391.119" dur="4.681">guns depending which country you&apos;re in</text><text start="2393.76" dur="4.26">um whereas we want to let people</text><text start="2395.8" dur="4.26">including the regulator have eyes and</text><text start="2398.02" dur="4.319">ears to exactly what we&apos;re doing</text><text start="2400.06" dur="5.64">so people can see the low level of</text><text start="2402.339" dur="6.681">impact that&apos;s being generated and so</text><text start="2405.7" dur="3.32">it&apos;s a different approach</text><text start="2409.72" dur="4.56">so now that we&apos;ll address the the</text><text start="2412.3" dur="4.08">environmental issues and you know we</text><text start="2414.28" dur="4.62">know what we&apos;re talking about our</text><text start="2416.38" dur="6.36">listeners are the target audience our</text><text start="2418.9" dur="6.54">investors and uh so</text><text start="2422.74" dur="5.3">this is your floor what do you need from</text><text start="2425.44" dur="4.919">investors how can we support your work</text><text start="2428.04" dur="4.78">moving forward</text><text start="2430.359" dur="5.361">thank you I see Daniel wanting to to</text><text start="2432.82" dur="2.9">interject but</text><text start="2437.5" dur="4.619">there were a handful of environmental</text><text start="2439.0" dur="5.46">topics you touched on that</text><text start="2442.119" dur="4.561">I just think are important to take one</text><text start="2444.46" dur="6.06">step further before we get into uh the</text><text start="2446.68" dur="6.0">business you know mind so</text><text start="2450.52" dur="4.26">broad was just recently mentioning coral</text><text start="2452.68" dur="4.26">and obviously the coral bleaching and</text><text start="2454.78" dur="3.96">die of issues and how critical Coral are</text><text start="2456.94" dur="3.54">to life in the oceans is a topic</text><text start="2458.74" dur="3.54">everyone&apos;s aware of</text><text start="2460.48" dur="3.599">um one of the other than grayberry Reef</text><text start="2462.28" dur="3.24">one of the major centers of coral in the</text><text start="2464.079" dur="3.421">world is off the coast of Indonesia</text><text start="2465.52" dur="3.78">which is the other place that the nickel</text><text start="2467.5" dur="4.02">can come in when Gerard was saying that</text><text start="2469.3" dur="4.86">90 plus percent of the ore that gets</text><text start="2471.52" dur="4.559">extracted is a waste product</text><text start="2474.16" dur="4.26">and most of that being a toxic waste</text><text start="2476.079" dur="5.221">product the waterways that that goes</text><text start="2478.42" dur="4.439">into if the mining tailing dams break</text><text start="2481.3" dur="3.0">which happens all the time like just</text><text start="2482.859" dur="3.301">look into</text><text start="2484.3" dur="4.559">um mining pollution toxicity mining</text><text start="2486.16" dur="4.02">tailing uh dams breaking just you do a</text><text start="2488.859" dur="3.48">bit of the study who&apos;s mentioning you</text><text start="2490.18" dur="4.5">know 190 billion tons of waste for</text><text start="2492.339" dur="4.681">mining compared to you know Municipal</text><text start="2494.68" dur="4.02">wasted a couple billion tons this is not</text><text start="2497.02" dur="4.819">just looking at that being a generally</text><text start="2498.7" dur="5.399">toxic issue but specifically in</text><text start="2501.839" dur="5.5">Indonesia where both the tropical</text><text start="2504.099" dur="5.461">rainforest on the surface and the</text><text start="2507.339" dur="4.26">um end of the Waterway where the waste</text><text start="2509.56" dur="5.88">would end up going are</text><text start="2511.599" dur="5.401">one of the most uh biodiverse on-surface</text><text start="2515.44" dur="3.54">and land areas in the world so that&apos;s</text><text start="2517.0" dur="4.44">just a really critical thing to you know</text><text start="2518.98" dur="4.52">think of think about</text><text start="2521.44" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="2523.66" dur="4.86">we know that when we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2525.099" dur="5.52">fracking or tar Sands it&apos;s because the</text><text start="2528.52" dur="4.38">really easy oil has already been mostly</text><text start="2530.619" dur="3.901">used up but nobody would go drill</text><text start="2532.9" dur="3.48">offshore for oil if there was easy oil</text><text start="2534.52" dur="4.26">onshore nobody would do fracking our tar</text><text start="2536.38" dur="3.959">Sands but you use up the easy stuff and</text><text start="2538.78" dur="2.819">then you get into diminishing returns</text><text start="2540.339" dur="2.581">we&apos;re in diminishing returns in</text><text start="2541.599" dur="2.76">hydrocarbons which is why we&apos;re doing</text><text start="2542.92" dur="4.439">that stuff which is another reason we</text><text start="2544.359" dur="4.98">have to switch energy sources quickly</text><text start="2547.359" dur="5.881">um but we&apos;re also in diminishing returns</text><text start="2549.339" dur="5.701">on so many sources of metals where the</text><text start="2553.24" dur="3.119">highest grade ores that were closest to</text><text start="2555.04" dur="2.94">the surface got used up that were</text><text start="2556.359" dur="3.421">easiest to get to the ones that are left</text><text start="2557.98" dur="3.48">or lower grade ore which means more</text><text start="2559.78" dur="3.96">toxicity or and much harder to get to</text><text start="2561.46" dur="4.92">areas which means having to penetrate</text><text start="2563.74" dur="5.7">deeper into big rainforests</text><text start="2566.38" dur="4.38">and it&apos;s not simply the impact let&apos;s say</text><text start="2569.44" dur="3.72">we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2570.76" dur="5.04">going into Indonesia or into the Amazon</text><text start="2573.16" dur="4.56">for mining assets</text><text start="2575.8" dur="3.66">uh it&apos;s not simply how much of the</text><text start="2577.72" dur="4.56">rainforest has to

dur="4.379">uh the binary of should we mine the</text><text start="2772.48" dur="4.26">oceans or not mine the oceans if we</text><text start="2774.099" dur="5.641">could just say yes let&apos;s just

dur="3.541">course that would be like yes let&apos;s just</text><text start="2782.56" dur="5.4">not but if it is</text><text start="2784.66" dur="4.74">selective highly regulated mining of

you</text><text start="2798.28" dur="3.9">have to get them from the surface</text><text start="2799.24" dur="6.24">sources and now you&apos;re dealing with</text><text start="2802.18" dur="6.899">look at what the surface source is for</text><text start="2805.48" dur="5.639">the nickel Cobalt manganese Etc are and</text><text start="2809.079" dur="3.841">look at the fact that they are largely</text><text start="2811.119" dur="4.441">things that produce much more toxic</text><text start="2812.92" dur="3.659">waste than the nodules do they had to</text><text start="2815.56" dur="2.36">have more effects on Surface</text><text start="2816.579" dur="4.561">biodiversity</text><text start="2817.92" dur="5.02">and in more biodiversity critical zones</text><text start="2821.14" dur="3.6">of the world</text><text start="2822.94" dur="3.179">or you say well let&apos;s just not have</text><text start="2824.74" dur="3.839">batteries and let&apos;s keep all the</text><text start="2826.119" dur="5.401">particular Transmission in the CO2</text><text start="2828.579" dur="5.161">and so then you can make a makeup answer</text><text start="2831.52" dur="3.9">called let&apos;s just need less energy well</text><text start="2833.74" dur="3.06">that&apos;s cute but that&apos;s just not going to</text><text start="2835.42" dur="4.26">happen unless you get rid of a

the trade-offs</text><text start="2843.099" dur="7.201">and say until someone can present how to</text><text start="2846.88" dur="6.6">radically degrow GDP and and or</text><text start="2850.3" dur="5.34">radically decrease energy without</text><text start="2853.48" dur="3.9">needing to decrease GDP neither one of</text><text start="2855.64" dur="3.479">which have real viable Solutions in the</text><text start="2857.38" dur="4.92">short term</text><text start="2859.119" dur="4.98">then that energy has to come from</text><text start="2862.3" dur="4.14">somewhere and if you want to get off</text><text start="2864.099" dur="5.041">hydrocarbons then where do those Metals</text><text start="2866.44" dur="6.36">come from those are real questions and</text><text start="2869.14" dur="5.16">so I want the best environmental answers</text><text start="2872.8" dur="3.0">for that I&apos;m willing for them to not be</text><text start="2874.3" dur="3.299">the best economic answers they just have</text><text start="2875.8" dur="4.08">to be viable enough that the people</text><text start="2877.599" dur="4.801">motivated by</text><text start="2879.88" dur="4.439">the economics are not motivated to go to</text><text start="2882.4" dur="5.16">war otherwise because of course poor</text><text start="2884.319" dur="7.861">economics can mean disproportionate harm</text><text start="2887.56" dur="6.84">to poor people it can mean uh a basis</text><text start="2892.18" dur="2.939">for war over resources</text><text start="2894.4" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="2895.119" dur="4.561">but what I would want the environmental</text><text start="2898.96" dur="3.119">um</text><text start="2899.68" dur="4.5">scientists and environmental groups and</text><text start="2902.079" dur="3.54">thinkers to do is to say okay let&apos;s</text><text start="2904.18" dur="4.679">really look at the entire trade-off</text><text start="2905.619" dur="5.941">space clearly and well and let&apos;s make</text><text start="2908.859" dur="4.26">sure that we if we&apos;re going to object to</text><text start="2911.56" dur="3.0">something that we have a comprehensively</text><text start="2913.119" dur="4.321">better proposal that we actually know</text><text start="2914.56" dur="4.98">how to enact if our better proposal has</text><text start="2917.44" dur="3.54">no inactibility like let&apos;s just decrease</text><text start="2919.54" dur="3.66">the total amount of energy The World</text><text start="2920.98" dur="3.06">Keeps by a lot that&apos;s not actually a</text><text start="2923.2" dur="3.78">solution</text><text start="2924.04" dur="4.279">so from what I can tell and I would</text><text start="2926.98" dur="3.359">change my position on this if anyone</text><text start="2928.319" dur="4.54">presented something better</text><text start="2930.339" dur="3.961">there is no realistic way to decrease</text><text start="2932.859" dur="2.821">the energy demands and there is no</text><text start="2934.3" dur="3.779">realistic way to get off hydrocarbon</text><text start="2935.68" dur="5.88">without increasing the metal lands</text><text start="2938.079" dur="5.28">and given that we&apos;re looking at the</text><text start="2941.56" dur="3.96">trade-offs between sourcing none of</text><text start="2943.359" dur="4.441">which are perfect but in this particular</text><text start="2945.52" dur="4.86">situation seemed quite clear for some of</text><text start="2947.8" dur="3.36">the baseballs</text><text start="2950.38" dur="3.62">um</text><text start="2951.16" dur="5.34">what a beautiful way to summarize</text><text start="2954.0" dur="4.18">what has been said and also from an</text><text start="2956.5" dur="4.8">integral perspective so I really</text><text start="2958.18" dur="5.22">appreciate that particularly because</text><text start="2961.3" dur="4.92">you know we need to make sure that we</text><text start="2963.4" dur="6.6">don&apos;t look in a naive way</text><text start="2966.22" dur="5.639">um into what needs to happen next and so</text><text start="2970.0" dur="3.06">those blind spots have to be addressed</text><text start="2971.859" dur="3.901">and</text><text start="2973.06" dur="5.039">um thank you um Gerard I mean the reason</text><text start="2975.76" dur="4.559">why I went into the cost and the</text><text start="2978.099" dur="5.401">investor the financial support was</text><text start="2980.319" dur="5.76">because I truly see that that you&apos;re</text><text start="2983.5" dur="6.0">doing at least as far as humanly</text><text start="2986.079" dur="5.28">possible in our culture and So within</text><text start="2989.5" dur="4.619">having said that and thank you for the</text><text start="2991.359" dur="5.641">summary Daniel I think uh I&apos;d like to</text><text start="2994.119" dur="6.48">know next from you Gerard how can we</text><text start="2997.0" dur="5.819">those of us who have</text><text start="3000.599" dur="4.681">financial means and focus on that</text><text start="3002.819" dur="6.201">support your

dur="5.041">you thank you so so we&apos;re really about</text><text start="3014.76" dur="5.66">building</text><text start="3017.16" dur="6.6">a community that supports this movement</text><text start="3020.42" dur="7.3">and you know I was</text><text start="3023.76" dur="7.559">I always enjoy any opportunity to be on</text><text start="3027.72" dur="6.899">a a medium with Daniel because he really</text><text start="3031.319" dur="5.881">does tap into a set of thinkers who are</text><text start="3034.619" dur="5.041">prepared to think a little bit you know</text><text start="3037.2" dur="6.119">deeper into the true issues and have a</text><text start="3039.66" dur="7.38">trade-off conversation and and obviously</text><text start="3043.319" dur="6.0">adding integral thinking into you know</text><text start="3047.04" dur="4.98">this and that being able to access that</text><text start="3049.319" dur="5.161">Community I see is really you know</text><text start="3052.02" dur="3.9">important as we try and find people that</text><text start="3054.48" dur="5.22">want to come and put their shoulder to</text><text start="3055.92" dur="8.34">the wheel because as Daniel said</text><text start="3059.7" dur="5.52">you know it&apos;s complex and also you know</text><text start="3064.26" dur="3.12">as</text><text start="3065.22" dur="3.96">as he said</text><text start="3067.38" dur="3.54">at the moment this seems to be the best</text><text start="3069.18" dur="4.139">solution it&apos;s something we always said</text><text start="3070.92" dur="6.54">to our

start="3080.339" dur="6.841">going on this and one of them is</text><text start="3083.24" dur="6.46">making sure that we do satisfy the</text><text start="3087.18" dur="4.8">requirement to not harm the environment</text><text start="3089.7" dur="5.76">you know there&apos;s nothing that has zero</text><text start="3091.98" dur="6.96">harm but but if we found that this</text><text start="3095.46" dur="5.46">ecosystem you know would be damaged such</text><text start="3098.94" dur="3.48">that it changed the function of the</text><text start="3100.92" dur="4.32">oceans then we would have some stop</text><text start="3102.42" dur="4.679">moments we&apos;d be like oh sorry guys</text><text start="3105.24" dur="4.74">um we&apos;ve got new information that needs</text><text start="3107.099" dur="5.821">us to to Pivot to a new look for a new</text><text start="3109.98" dur="5.4">extractive uh new Supply to these</text><text start="3112.92" dur="5.04">important Metals but so far all of

Present</text><text start="3222.48" dur="7.139">Value today of more than 15 billion</text><text start="3226.619" dur="4.321">dollars you know and and if we were a</text><text start="3229.619" dur="4.22">land-based</text><text start="3230.94" dur="5.34">project at the same stage of development</text><text start="3233.839" dur="6.641">the value of our company would be</text><text start="3236.28" dur="8.42">between about 0.2 and 0.7 times that nav</text><text start="3240.48" dur="8.7">so 0.2 or 0.7 times 15 billion dollars</text><text start="3244.7" dur="7.84">yet our value is not that it&apos;s it&apos;s more</text><text start="3249.18" dur="6.26">like it&apos;s like point zero one percent of</text><text start="3252.54" dur="6.9">the nav and so a bit more than that but</text><text start="3255.44" dur="5.379">0.015 so that seems wrong so there&apos;s a</text><text start="3259.44" dur="3.78">disconnect</text><text start="3260.819" dur="4.201">um you know at about 60 of the register</text><text start="3263.22" dur="5.099">is really sticky like people like myself</text><text start="3265.02" dur="6.48">and all C&apos;s and our largest shareholder</text><text start="3268.319" dur="5.461">from uh San Francisco a family office</text><text start="3271.5" dur="4.619">who&apos;ve been you know so really committed</text><text start="3273.78" dur="3.539">people who are not looking at this as a</text><text start="3276.119" dur="3.541">trade</text><text start="3277.319" dur="4.321">to make money that they&apos;re in this for</text><text start="3279.66" dur="4.32">the long term and so what we really want</text><text start="3281.64" dur="4.14">to do is to get more people to come and</text><text start="3283.98" dur="5.4">join us on this journey to buy the</text><text start="3285.78" dur="7.86">shares to share us into their Community</text><text start="3289.38" dur="7.14">such that we can you know have Community</text><text start="3293.64" dur="6.0">discussions like this so we can find</text><text start="3296.52" dur="4.98">people who have a willingness to come</text><text start="3299.64" dur="4.56">and learn more and to come and support</text><text start="3301.5" dur="4.98">this new industry and</text><text start="3304.2" dur="3.84">it&apos;s very rare that you can be at the</text><text start="3306.48" dur="4.56">beginning of a new industry but that&apos;s</text><text start="3308.04" dur="6.84">where we are like and this is a really</text><text start="3311.04" dur="6.9">exciting time because you know it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="3314.88" dur="4.86">one analogy is you know offshore oil and</text><text start="3317.94" dur="3.48">gas once upon a time there was no</text><text start="3319.74" dur="4.02">offshore oil and gas and then in the</text><text start="3321.42" dur="4.08">blink of an eye 30 of oil and gas</text><text start="3323.76" dur="3.9">supplies came offshore</text><text start="3325.5" dur="5.76">I think it could be even more aggressive</text><text start="3327.66" dur="5.88">when it comes to uh these Metals when it</text><text start="3331.26" dur="6.18">comes to nickel and Cobalt and manganese</text><text start="3333.54" dur="6.48">that more more Supply could come out of</text><text start="3337.44" dur="7.139">the ocean so I&apos;m very encouraged by that</text><text start="3340.02" dur="7.92">so um so yeah that&apos;s I think there are</text><text start="3344.579" dur="6.301">many many different ways and um</text><text start="3347.94" dur="5.58">you know I think getting people to buy</text><text start="3350.88" dur="4.92">the stock and getting people to to talk</text><text start="3353.52" dur="5.64">about the story and to come and be</text><text start="3355.8" dur="7.38">inquisitive and and to want to learn</text><text start="3359.16" dur="5.459">more and allow us to to talk to their</text><text start="3363.18" dur="5.1">networks</text><text start="3364.619" dur="6.901">um important networks of of thinkers uh</text><text start="3368.28" dur="5.039">is the areas that can help us most we</text><text start="3371.52" dur="4.319">are talking to a broad range of</text><text start="3373.319" dur="6.121">strategic Partners now because one of</text><text start="3375.839" dur="5.941">the ways companies like ours Finance</text><text start="3379.44" dur="4.02">their future activities is by inviting</text><text start="3381.78" dur="4.92">other companies to come and invest at</text><text start="3383.46" dur="5.7">the asset so not into our topco because</text><text start="3386.7" dur="4.08">obviously we think the stock is hugely</text><text start="3389.16" dur="3.48">devalued</text><text start="3390.78" dur="4.799">um so we don&apos;t want to be issuing more</text><text start="3392.64" dur="5.28">shares what we want to do is to unlock</text><text start="3395.579" dur="5.04">some of that 15 billion dollars of Net</text><text start="3397.92" dur="4.62">Present Value and so you know I</text><text start="3400.619" dur="3.901">mentioned at our last earnings call that</text><text start="3402.54" dur="5.4">we&apos;re talking to a variety of strategic</text><text start="3404.52" dur="6.48">names about earning into those assets</text><text start="3407.94" dur="7.2">and and that&apos;s a way that you know we</text><text start="3411.0" dur="6.359">can avoid dilution uh invite strategic</text><text start="3415.14" dur="5.64">names in who can help us with capital</text><text start="3417.359" dur="6.98">and expertise as needed to start</text><text start="3420.78" dur="3.559">developing these important assets</text><text start="3425.04" dur="4.74">well thank you so very much Gerard and</text><text start="3427.859" dur="5.101">you know as an investor I know how</text><text start="3429.78" dur="4.92">values uh decrease like that and I I can</text><text start="3432.96" dur="3.78">only imagine you know what you&apos;ve been</text><text start="3434.7" dur="4.56">going through over the past uh 12 years</text><text start="3436.74" dur="5.04">but Daniel had a question that goes in</text><text start="3439.26" dur="6.599">that direction Daniel 102.</text><text start="3441.78" dur="6.299">yeah just in in case it&apos;s not obvious do</text><text start="3445.859" dur="4.021">you want to say why you believe the</text><text start="3448.079" dur="3.181">stock value went down because obviously</text><text start="3449.88" dur="2.88">if you&apos;re asking people to invest it&apos;s</text><text start="3451.26" dur="2.88">based on the idea that stock value is</text><text start="3452.76" dur="3.839">going to go up and in addition to</text><text start="3454.14" dur="5.64">investment what else would create a</text><text start="3456.599" dur="7.801">turnaround in that yeah most certainly</text><text start="3459.78" dur="7.26">um look uh the the main issue that</text><text start="3464.4" dur="6.3">people have about you know our valuation</text><text start="3467.04" dur="6.059">is the fact that the final regulations</text><text start="3470.7" dur="6.26">have not been adopted yet so at the</text><text start="3473.099" dur="7.5">moment we have exploration licenses and</text><text start="3476.96" dur="5.5">the that allows us to apply for an</text><text start="3480.599" dur="4.681">exploitation license over those same</text><text start="3482.46" dur="5.46">defined areas and so so if you like</text><text start="3485.28" dur="5.039">we&apos;ve been busy putting the cart beside</text><text start="3487.92" dur="3.659">the horse along the way</text><text start="3490.319" dur="4.26">um maybe even in front of the horse</text><text start="3491.579" dur="5.401">sometimes but the final exploitation</text><text start="3494.579" dur="5.341">code is due to be adopted later this</text><text start="3496.98" dur="5.04">year and that is they are the rules that</text><text start="3499.92" dur="6.24">will allow us to then submit our</text><text start="3502.02" dur="7.5">application and move from exploration to</text><text start="3506.16" dur="5.3">extraction phase and so obviously the</text><text start="3509.52" dur="4.86">moment that happens</text><text start="3511.46" dur="5.08">that massively opens up the value of</text><text start="3514.38" dur="4.979">those assets we we already have our</text><text start="3516.54" dur="4.86">first production asset the Hidden Gem so</text><text start="3519.359" dur="5.22">the boat that we are out uh on our</text><text start="3521.4" dur="6.3">license area with last year that was</text><text start="3524.579" dur="6.301">owned and operated by all Seas will also</text><text start="3527.7" dur="5.58">be our first production asset when once</text><text start="3530.88" dur="4.56">we receive the commercial permit to move</text><text start="3533.28" dur="4.5">ahead and so I think that&apos;s the main</text><text start="3535.44" dur="4.2">gating item now of course there were</text><text start="3537.78" dur="4.559">some other things when we became a</text><text start="3539.64" dur="5.459">public company you know we had you know</text><text start="3542.339" dur="4.921">a short report came out we had a funding</text><text start="3545.099" dur="5.581">short for one about the major investors</text><text start="3547.26" dur="6.18">who&apos;d committed to investing</text><text start="3550.68" dur="4.08">um uh went bankrupt and so that was a</text><text start="3553.44" dur="4.02">problem for us</text><text start="3554.76" dur="6.839">um we we went public via a merger with a</text><text start="3557.46" dur="7.92">SPAC which in 2020 was all the rage when</text><text start="3561.599" dur="6.121">we announced our deal on March 4 2021 we</text><text start="3565.38" dur="5.82">were kind of the last back to get</text><text start="3567.72" dur="5.7">through the gates and the SEC really</text><text start="3571.2" dur="4.32">turn their focus on Sparks because there</text><text start="3573.42" dur="5.46">are a lot of crazy businesses that went</text><text start="3575.52" dur="4.68">public uh through spax you know I would</text><text start="3578.88" dur="3.419">never invest in them because they</text><text start="3580.2" dur="5.399">weren&apos;t underwritten by tangible assets</text><text start="3582.299" dur="6.78">you know they were they were pipe dreams</text><text start="3585.599" dur="5.641">um so that meant we went public thinking</text><text start="3589.079" dur="4.74">we were going to raise about 600 million</text><text start="3591.24" dur="5.16">dollars but the Redemption rate of ounce</text><text start="3593.819" dur="6.061">back went from you know low single</text><text start="3596.4" dur="6.06">digits in the year 2020 all of a sudden</text><text start="3599.88" dur="4.739">in 2021 Redemption rates went back to</text><text start="3602.46" dur="3.659">normal which were very very high so a</text><text start="3604.619" dur="4.561">lot of the money that we thought we were</text><text start="3606.119" dur="4.5">raising uh either redeemed or in the</text><text start="3609.18" dur="4.5">case of our defaulting investor</text><text start="3610.619" dur="5.521">defaulted so it meant we raised 137</text><text start="3613.68" dur="3.6">million dollars instead of 600. so that</text><text start="3616.14" dur="4.26">meant</text><text start="3617.28" dur="5.039">you know that was a real you know kick</text><text start="3620.4" dur="3.959">in the teeth and we had to decide well</text><text start="3622.319" dur="4.141">what do we do do we do we proceed and</text><text start="3624.359" dur="3.72">remain a private company or do we</text><text start="3626.46" dur="5.22">proceed and become a public company we</text><text start="3628.079" dur="5.701">decided to stay on the public path we</text><text start="3631.68" dur="4.8">um it provided us enough money to keep</text><text start="3633.78" dur="5.579">the program on track and and amazingly</text><text start="3636.48" dur="5.52">thank you to an amazing team we&apos;ve kept</text><text start="3639.359" dur="4.5">the program on track so we still are</text><text start="3642.0" dur="5.339">committed to First production at the end</text><text start="3643.859" dur="8.361">of 2024. now we&apos;re at the beginning of</text><text start="3647.339" dur="4.881">2023 so at the end of next year we&apos;ve</text><text start="3660.599" dur="6.861">for some reason we lost Gerard</text><text start="3664.559" dur="2.901">I see that</text><text start="3667.74" dur="7.319">so while he was uh describing uh his uh</text><text start="3672.599" dur="5.341">challenges with uh with uh you know a</text><text start="3675.059" dur="5.401">startup I could only refer to or think</text><text start="3677.94" dur="4.26">back to what we experienced with the</text><text start="3680.46" dur="4.619">energy turn around startup and I</text><text start="3682.2" dur="5.46">originally wanted to have the you know</text><text start="3685.079" dur="4.02">co-founder be with us because he would</text><text start="3687.66" dur="4.08">have brought a different and you know</text><text start="3689.099" dur="5.281">regulatory aspect from an industry that</text><text start="3691.74" dur="4.619">is just you know starting to uh get</text><text start="3694.38" dur="4.02">involved in how the current Regulators</text><text start="3696.359" dur="2.94">are basically</text><text start="3698.4" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="3699.299" dur="4.32">doing everything and anything to prevent</text><text start="3701.4" dur="4.219">you from uh from being successful so</text><text start="3703.619" dur="4.621">Gerard actually</text><text start="3705.619" dur="5.801">elaborated that so as a serial</text><text start="3708.24" dur="6.72">entrepreneur is and an investor for more</text><text start="3711.42" dur="5.82">than 30 years I I so can sympathize with</text><text start="3714.96" dur="4.32">what Gerard has been going through and</text><text start="3717.24" dur="4.5">you know I know and if I remember</text><text start="3719.28" dur="4.62">correctly you invested several uh tens</text><text start="3721.74" dur="4.079">of millions of your own money into this</text><text start="3723.9" dur="4.32">company because you believe in it and</text><text start="3725.819" dur="5.161">that&apos;s basically the best way the best</text><text start="3728.22" dur="5.52">confirmation for investors if the</text><text start="3730.98" dur="6.18">founder you know puts um all of his uh</text><text start="3733.74" dur="6.119">eggs into one basket then that&apos;s the way</text><text start="3737.16" dur="4.98">to go and so I can only encourage</text><text start="3739.859" dur="5.421">everyone and anyone to who is listening</text><text start="3742.14" dur="7.32">to this to really uh join forces with us</text><text start="3745.28" dur="7.86">so annelus Daniel do you have any more</text><text start="3749.46" dur="3.68">questions for uh for Gerard</text><text start="3754.38" dur="4.919">I had one quick thing I was going to say</text><text start="3756.359" dur="5.821">is at one point Gerard said</text><text start="3759.299" dur="6.601">um don&apos;t think that the resources won&apos;t</text><text start="3762.18" dur="6.84">be uh collected or exploited at some</text><text start="3765.9" dur="5.12">point through some process</text><text start="3769.02" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="3771.119" dur="3.72">the</text><text start="3772.5" dur="4.74">orientation for growth and the need of</text><text start="3774.839" dur="4.141">metals and growth seems</text><text start="3777.24" dur="2.819">and the</text><text start="3778.98" dur="2.76">you know</text><text start="3780.059" dur="3.421">nodules</text><text start="3781.74" dur="3.24">having a straightforward method to</text><text start="3783.48" dur="3.3">collect them that has only been legally</text><text start="3784.98" dur="3.42">hung up</text><text start="3786.78" dur="3.42">um and the market demand on those</text><text start="3788.4" dur="5.399">continuing to increase makes it seem</text><text start="3790.2" dur="6.119">really crystal clear those will become a</text><text start="3793.799" dur="4.681">collected asset so then the question is</text><text start="3796.319" dur="5.581">how environmentally well is it regulated</text><text start="3798.48" dur="5.099">and let&apos;s say you know we already see</text><text start="3801.9" dur="3.48">people working on</text><text start="3803.579" dur="6.24">um</text><text start="3805.38" dur="7.199">uh geoengineering involving</text><text start="3809.819" dur="5.28">um solar radiation aerosols in the upper</text><text start="3812.579" dur="4.681">atmosphere that might have unbelievably</text><text start="3815.099" dur="3.5">huge environmental consequences out of a</text><text start="3817.26" dur="5.099">kind of like</text><text start="3818.599" dur="6.161">Terror associated with climate change</text><text start="3822.359" dur="4.561">when you start to get in really Back</text><text start="3824.76" dur="4.68">Against The Wall positions then you move</text><text start="3826.92" dur="5.1">forward in less conscious ways and I can</text><text start="3829.44" dur="4.139">see the world moving forward in a less</text><text start="3832.02" dur="3.42">conscious way with regard to this when</text><text start="3833.579" dur="4.921">it becomes you know critical that it&apos;s</text><text start="3835.44" dur="5.94">needed late I would actually really</text><text start="3838.5" dur="4.44">rather have the regulatory pathway be</text><text start="3841.38" dur="3.12">quite strict like I would like very</text><text start="3842.94" dur="4.139">strict environmental regulation I would</text><text start="3844.5" dur="5.04">like other submersibles down there that</text><text start="3847.079" dur="4.201">are monitoring the ocean quality and</text><text start="3849.54" dur="3.059">monitoring the plumes and monitoring the</text><text start="3851.28" dur="3.24">biodiversity making sure everything is</text><text start="3852.599" dur="3.421">good which means that I would like a</text><text start="3854.52" dur="3.539">company that is actually really invested</text><text start="3856.02" dur="4.44">in that helping to open up the initial</text><text start="3858.059" dur="4.861">regulatory pathway that says actually</text><text start="3860.46" dur="4.74">we&apos;re not trying to talk you into using</text><text start="3862.92" dur="3.72">lobbying efforts uh decreasing</text><text start="3865.2" dur="3.119">regulatory standards we actually want</text><text start="3866.64" dur="2.939">you to increase the regulatory standards</text><text start="3868.319" dur="4.141">so that then</text><text start="3869.579" dur="4.861">whether it&apos;s the major Chinese mining</text><text start="3872.46" dur="3.48">companies or it&apos;s Lockheed or any of the</text><text start="3874.44" dur="4.32">other companies that might not have as</text><text start="3875.94" dur="5.639">much environmental uh motivation</text><text start="3878.76" dur="4.5">themselves they&apos;re actually both they&apos;re</text><text start="3881.579" dur="5.821">now bound to do it by a regulatory</text><text start="3883.26" dur="6.0">process that has transparency so</text><text start="3887.4" dur="3.659">um there does seem to be an</text><text start="3889.26" dur="3.66">inevitability argument and then what is</text><text start="3891.059" dur="3.901">the best way to do it it feels like an</text><text start="3892.92" dur="4.28">important part of this that I wanted to</text><text start="3894.96" dur="5.46">also mention</text><text start="3897.2" dur="5.5">thank you Daniel and I&apos;d like to um also</text><text start="3900.42" dur="4.62">you know give the word again to Jarred</text><text start="3902.7" dur="4.2">who was cut off from uh you know using</text><text start="3905.04" dur="4.62">this beautiful technology of the future</text><text

time frames</text><text start="4034.52" dur="4.799">so we&apos;ve been really really busy busy</text><text start="4036.76" dur="5.02">and we were able to really pin out his</text><text start="4039.319" dur="4.8">back during covert as well because we&apos;d</text><text start="4041.78" dur="4.44">raise some money privately and we were</text><text start="4044.119" dur="5.641">well funded to and we knew that it would</text><text start="4046.22" dur="5.819">be a a challenging time covert but we</text><text start="4049.76" dur="3.9">created this bubble you know and we</text><text start="4052.039" dur="3.661">didn&apos;t lose a single day through covert</text><text start="4053.66" dur="3.3">and we were able to achieve amazing</text><text start="4055.7" dur="4.08">progress</text><text start="4056.96" dur="4.5">um that allowed us to become you know to</text><text start="4059.78" dur="5.279">get through the public uh company</text><text start="4061.46" dur="6.48">process so so look it&apos;s a uh it&apos;s a</text><text start="4065.059" dur="6.181">company that that I think you know will</text><text start="4067.94" dur="5.34">benefit by being

thank you</text><text start="4084.619" dur="6.301">thanks so much Iran also Daniel for you</text><text start="4088.579" dur="4.441">know really mapping out that complexity</text><text start="4090.92"

join us on</text><text start="4097.58" dur="4.739">the journey</text><text start="4099.02" dur="5.94">um that is also for essential for</text><text start="4102.319" dur="5.281">cultivating trust uh because there&apos;s</text><text start="4104.96" dur="4.98">transparency in there is openness so</text><text start="4107.6" dur="4.139">perhaps in closing can you let us know</text><text start="4109.94" dur="3.359">some of the ways in which we can join</text><text start="4111.739" dur="3.241">you on the journey I started already</text><text start="4113.299" dur="4.38">exploring your</text><text start="4114.98" dur="4.98">um your Vimeo Channel and going through</text><text start="4117.679" dur="5.761">the videos which was really informative</text><text start="4119.96" dur="5.58">you know other ways that we can join you</text><text start="4123.44" dur="5.819">on the journey</text><text start="4125.54" dur="6.5">well I I think we have a really rich</text><text start="4129.259" dur="6.801">um Resource Center at our website at</text><text start="4132.04" dur="8.98">metals.co and if you go to the um</text><text start="4136.06" dur="7.119">uh to the the FAQs there you&apos;ll see us</text><text start="4141.02" dur="4.14">address many of the things that are</text><text start="4143.179" dur="4.741">probably going to cross your mind you</text><text start="4145.16" dur="5.4">know the the tricky questions about why</text><text start="4147.92" dur="5.339">we&apos;re doing this and uh and impacts and</text><text start="4150.56" dur="5.46">so on and you know as you mentioned we</text><text start="4153.259" dur="5.701">have a rich video library we&apos;ve you know</text><text start="4156.02" dur="4.739">we had uh filmographers on the boats you</text><text start="4158.96" dur="4.02">know we we always do because we really</text><text start="4160.759" dur="5.341">want to catalog this journey so people</text><text start="4162.98" dur="5.819">can at least feel they&apos;re part of it</text><text start="4166.1" dur="5.219">um and so you know come up the knowledge</text><text start="4168.799" dur="4.92">curve but we really need action as well</text><text start="4171.319" dur="3.841">you know it&apos;s if if the result of this</text><text start="4173.719" dur="3.96">call is that everyone&apos;s a little bit</text><text start="4175.16" dur="4.619">better informed then I failed I really</text><text start="4177.679" dur="5.64">need people to get involved and how you</text><text start="4179.779" dur="5.48">can get involved is uh send me an email</text><text start="4183.319" dur="5.721">at Jared metals.com</text><text start="4185.259" dur="6.701">buy the stock think about your community</text><text start="4189.04" dur="5.38">that you can tell about this important</text><text start="4191.96" dur="4.98">story you might have people that just</text><text start="4194.42" dur="5.759">you think could have their own platform</text><text start="4196.94" dur="5.279">that we could do a repeat session such</text><text start="4200.179" dur="4.621">as we&apos;re doing today if it can reach a</text><text start="4202.219" dur="4.921">broader audience and I know that when</text><text start="4204.8" dur="5.419">Daniel first suggested Mariana to me it</text><text start="4207.14" dur="6.48">was it it was because of your work with</text><text start="4210.219" dur="5.321">the integral uh thinking it was because</text><text start="4213.62" dur="3.9">of your work with Club of Rome and it</text><text start="4215.54" dur="5.1">was because of your network you know</text><text start="4217.52" dur="5.159">around the world that he really said</text><text start="4220.64" dur="4.86">this is a really important session Jared</text><text start="4222.679" dur="6.601">and and you know I&apos;m I&apos;m grateful for</text><text start="4225.5" dur="6.719">that because you know sometimes it feels</text><text start="4229.28" dur="5.1">like it&apos;s one conversation at a time</text><text start="4232.219" dur="4.861">that obviously if that can lead to a</text><text start="4234.38" dur="4.98">thousand to a million then that&apos;s the</text><text start="4237.08" dur="5.159">journey that I really need some help</text><text start="4239.36" dur="4.92">from people on and and and you know</text><text start="4242.239" dur="3.721">we&apos;re making tremendous progress on the</text><text start="4244.28" dur="4.26">project as I mentioned I think we&apos;re</text><text start="4245.96" dur="4.739">really well squared away there</text><text start="4248.54" dur="4.199">um but this the the challenge of</text><text start="4250.699" dur="4.261">communicating this to the broader market</text><text start="4252.739" dur="3.48">and the investing Community is something</text><text start="4254.96" dur="3.36">that clearly</text><text start="4256.219" dur="4.621">look at our stock price we haven&apos;t done</text><text start="4258.32" dur="5.46">well enough that but the business that</text><text start="4260.84" dur="4.5">underlies it is is in great shape and we</text><text start="4263.78" dur="3.419">feel very confident about the direction</text><text start="4265.34" dur="3.3">we&apos;re heading we don&apos;t have all the</text><text start="4267.199" dur="3.661">answers yet you know and that&apos;s why</text><text start="4268.64" dur="4.559">we&apos;re spending the money and you know</text><text start="4270.86" dur="4.44">we&apos;re pro we&apos;re we&apos;re moving ahead I</text><text start="4273.199" dur="3.96">think in a very precautionary sense but</text><text start="4275.3" dur="5.16">with a commercial imperative</text><text start="4277.159" dur="5.641">because you know this this crisis is not</text><text start="4280.46" dur="6.06">something to think about it&apos;s here you</text><text start="4282.8" dur="5.76">know we we really need to be taking uh</text><text start="4286.52" dur="5.46">Progressive steps to be dealing with it</text><text start="4288.56" dur="5.94">and you know we tend to be you know we</text><text start="4291.98" dur="3.96">are solutions oriented and we you know</text><text start="4294.5" dur="3.06">we think this is going to be one of the</text><text start="4295.94" dur="2.58">most important</text><text start="4297.56" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="4298.52" dur="4.02">dances certainly to the metal crisis and</text><text start="4301.34" dur="3.8">so</text><text start="4302.54" dur="2.6">yeah</text><text start="4305.179" dur="4.201">Daniel</text><text start="4307.58" dur="3.24">one of the things I actually really like</text><text start="4309.38" dur="2.94">about this</text><text start="4310.82" dur="3.359">this particular situation that I find</text><text start="4312.32" dur="3.18">interesting about it that almost all</text><text start="4314.179" dur="3.0">entrepreneurs would find infinitely</text><text start="4315.5" dur="4.32">frustrating as I like that it actually</text><text start="4317.179" dur="4.681">has to pass through a regulatory process</text><text start="4319.82" dur="5.28">that is looking at environmental and</text><text start="4321.86" dur="4.799">social and other forms of externality</text><text start="4325.1" dur="3.24">possibilities first because that&apos;s</text><text start="4326.659" dur="4.02">actually something that I propose as</text><text start="4328.34" dur="3.6">necessary for all Industries in the</text><text start="4330.679" dur="4.5">world moving forward to make it to the</text><text start="4331.94" dur="4.68">meta crisis if you look at Gerard was</text><text start="4335.179" dur="3.841">saying this is kind of unique in that</text><text start="4336.62" dur="4.5">typically a company will</text><text start="4339.02" dur="3.719">move forward Advance new stuff and then</text><text start="4341.12" dur="3.9">the problems get regulated later</text><text start="4342.739" dur="5.341">obviously four out of five doctors used</text><text start="4345.02" dur="5.639">to choose Camel cigarettes and uh it</text><text start="4348.08" dur="4.44">wasn&apos;t until you know so much lung</text><text start="4350.659" dur="3.601">cancer death that finally regulation</text><text start="4352.52" dur="3.78">happened there and the same was true</text><text start="4354.26" dur="4.32">with pesticides and DDT and whatever</text><text start="4356.3" dur="3.3">with leaded gasoline</text><text start="4358.58" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="4359.6" dur="5.52">you remember in the 50s people spraying</text><text start="4362.48" dur="4.62">DDT on everything right it was just</text><text start="4365.12" dur="4.5">mosquito on themselves food and and</text><text start="4367.1" dur="4.74">Rachel Carson had to work so hard and</text><text start="4369.62" dur="3.9">then when we finally banded all the harm</text><text start="4371.84" dur="4.26">had already occurred</text><text start="4373.52" dur="4.74">um but the 20 30 80 years that it takes</text><text start="4376.1" dur="4.32">afterwards with things that have faster</text><text start="4378.26" dur="4.02">and faster effects like effects of</text><text start="4380.42" dur="3.48">synthetic bio and AI it just won&apos;t work</text><text start="4382.28" dur="3.419">by the time that the harm is that clear</text><text start="4383.9" dur="4.44">the world will be destroyed so we</text><text start="4385.699" dur="4.441">actually have to move to a place where</text><text start="4388.34" dur="3.96">with new technologies that can have such</text><text start="4390.14" dur="4.14">a rapid effect on the world we do the</text><text start="4392.3" dur="4.8">process to anticipate the unanticipated</text><text start="4394.28" dur="5.459">and Thor effects and figure out the</text><text start="4397.1" dur="5.099">right paths for the commercialization of</text><text start="4399.739" dur="4.621">the technology with a regulatory process</text><text start="4402.199" dur="3.601">so that is actually something that I</text><text start="4404.36" dur="2.7">think the world will have to move to to</text><text start="4405.8" dur="2.879">make it out of the meta crisis of course</text><text start="4407.06" dur="3.36">that means we have to have regulation</text><text start="4408.679" dur="3.121">that is both effective and competent and</text><text start="4410.42" dur="4.08">that we trust and there&apos;s lots of things</text><text start="4411.8" dur="4.8">involved in that so I want to see super</text><text start="4414.5" dur="3.719">strict regulation here I want to see a</text><text start="4416.6" dur="4.139">company that really cares about that</text><text start="4418.219" dur="4.261">with independent oversight from from MIT</text><text start="4420.739" dur="2.94">and oceanographic institutes looking at</text><text start="4422.48" dur="4.38">it</text><text start="4423.679" dur="5.101">um and I do want to see very complex</text><text start="4426.86" dur="4.62">comparisons of the trade-offs between</text><text start="4428.78" dur="4.8">surface mining and alternative energy</text><text start="4431.48" dur="4.679">storage Technologies and all of those</text><text start="4433.58" dur="4.26">things one of the things that had me</text><text start="4436.159" dur="3.721">actually make friends at Gerard and</text><text start="4437.84" dur="4.859">Erica is not on the call but it&apos;s</text><text start="4439.88" dur="5.22">brilliant uh and why they kind of picked</text><text start="4442.699" dur="3.601">the name medalsco is like the moment we</text><text start="4445.1" dur="2.639">can get these medals from recycled</text><text start="4446.3" dur="3.359">sources because there are enough Metals</text><text start="4447.739" dur="3.96">we&apos;ll switch and not do infancy sources</text><text start="4449.659" dur="4.261">if there was a better Source we would</text><text start="4451.699" dur="5.301">move to that the key is actually how do</text><text start="4453.92" dur="6.0">we create a closed loop material economy</text><text start="4457.0" dur="5.02">closed material economy writ large takes</text><text start="4459.92" dur="5.94">a ton of energy lots of big</text><text start="4462.02" dur="5.76">challenges so if to survive planetary</text><text start="4465.86" dur="3.42">boundaries we need to make a closed loop</text><text start="4467.78" dur="3.12">materials economy so we&apos;re not making</text><text start="4469.28" dur="3.66">anything conversion resources and</text><text start="4470.9" dur="3.36">turning it into trash and pollution and</text><text start="4472.94" dur="4.14">we have to make a closer materials</text><text start="4474.26" dur="4.38">economy with renewable energy then being</text><text start="4477.08" dur="3.24">able to boot the Renewable Energy System</text><text start="4478.64" dur="5.099">to close up everything else is one of</text><text start="4480.32" dur="5.879">the first kind of big keys to that</text><text start="4483.739" dur="4.44">and I think one of the places where</text><text start="4486.199" dur="5.821">challenges occurred like you know I know</text><text start="4488.179" dur="5.52">other major multinational type companies</text><text start="4492.02" dur="2.82">that would invest Less in science and</text><text start="4493.699" dur="4.201">More in lobbying the international</text><text start="4494.84" dur="4.62">seabed Authority and uh other groups I&apos;m</text><text start="4497.9" dur="3.18">sure will work to do that I actually</text><text start="4499.46" dur="3.84">really like a group that is focused on</text><text start="4501.08" dur="4.92">the science to work</text><text start="4503.3" dur="3.899">um you know the process formally</text><text start="4506.0" dur="3.719">um</text><text start="4507.199" dur="4.861">but obviously when there&apos;s a negative</text><text start="4509.719" dur="6.241">environmental narrative that makes it</text><text start="4512.06" dur="6.179">risky for investors and I one of the</text><text start="4515.96" dur="4.56">things that I respect is that you know</text><text start="4518.239" dur="3.901">they have invested in having some of the</text><text start="4520.52" dur="3.719">best ocean scientists and</text><text start="4522.14" dur="4.559">conservationists on their team working</text><text start="4524.239" dur="4.5">on how do you in order to do this well</text><text start="4526.699" dur="4.441">how do you make it different and it has</text><text start="4528.739" dur="4.98">involved changes to the original Tech</text><text start="4531.14" dur="4.86">significantly based on how to really do</text><text start="4533.719"
