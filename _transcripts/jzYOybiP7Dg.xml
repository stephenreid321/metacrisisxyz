happy to see</text><text start="123.96" dur="5.7">everybody who&apos;s here</text><text start="126.36" dur="5.459">um so opening remarks about the uh</text><text start="129.66" dur="4.26">intention of this and a little bit of a</text><text start="131.819" dur="4.441">recap from the last one that I&apos;ll give</text><text start="133.92" dur="3.78">and then Professor Morris will do the</text><text start="136.26" dur="2.64">same and then we&apos;ll dive on into</text><text start="137.7" dur="3.42">people&apos;s questions which is the</text><text start="138.9" dur="4.08">intention today</text><text start="141.12" dur="3.96">um in case there are some people who are</text><text start="142.98" dur="4.44">here that did not watch the previous one</text><text start="145.08" dur="4.56">we did this was intended to be q a for</text><text start="147.42" dur="3.06">that one if you did watch it awesome if</text><text start="149.64" dur="5.28">not</text><text start="150.48" dur="5.94">um the we it was our second recording</text><text start="154.92" dur="3.179">actually and we squeezed it into like</text><text start="156.42" dur="4.08">three hours because the first time it</text><text start="158.099" dur="3.601">was like six hours and we decided that</text><text start="160.5" dur="3.72">not enough people would make it through</text><text start="161.7" dur="4.319">but it could really easily be much much</text><text start="164.22" dur="4.32">more than that because</text><text start="166.019" dur="4.44">what uh Gilbert was trying to do was</text><text start="168.54" dur="4.559">walk us through</text><text start="170.459" dur="4.86">um a few thousand years of history of</text><text start="173.099" dur="5.241">slavery globally of racial conflict</text><text start="175.319" dur="5.821">globally of uh philosophic</text><text start="178.34" dur="6.399">rationalization and economics uh</text><text start="181.14" dur="6.3">benefits of uh slavery and the encoding</text><text start="184.739" dur="5.341">in law that all create context for what</text><text start="187.44" dur="4.56">was both in common in the American</text><text start="190.08" dur="4.019">slavery situation with others but also</text><text start="192.0" dur="3.9">what was very unique about it that</text><text start="194.099" dur="3.841">brings us to the uniqueness of the</text><text start="195.9" dur="4.199">current conflict that is all really</text><text start="197.94" dur="3.9">important part of the context for saying</text><text start="200.099" dur="4.201">how would we understand this well enough</text><text start="201.84" dur="3.3">to know how to go forward</text><text start="204.3" dur="4.62">um</text><text start="205.14" dur="5.599">my intention in hosting that or in</text><text start="208.92" dur="5.76">having that conversation with Gilbert</text><text start="210.739" dur="5.561">very important for me to be clear I do</text><text start="214.68" dur="4.559">not have any deep expertise in this</text><text start="216.3" dur="5.939">topic I had that earnestness and</text><text start="219.239" dur="5.041">curiosity and the lack of expertise and</text><text start="222.239" dur="5.341">there were a few people that did a kind</text><text start="224.28" dur="5.34">job of educating me and uh Gilbert was</text><text start="227.58" dur="3.6">the person who was able to kind of walk</text><text start="229.62" dur="4.199">me through the history of different</text><text start="231.18" dur="5.22">schools of racial Theory and how did</text><text start="233.819" dur="5.041">critical legal uh Theory turn into</text><text start="236.4" dur="4.5">critical race Theory turn into the woke</text><text start="238.86" dur="3.42">movement and BLM and how is it held</text><text start="240.9" dur="2.94">differently in different countries and</text><text start="242.28" dur="2.179">kind of</text><text start="243.84" dur="3.24">um</text><text start="244.459" dur="4.42">helped me understand not just the</text><text start="247.08" dur="5.28">history of it in an objective sense but</text><text start="248.879" dur="5.521">the different views on it and um</text><text start="252.36" dur="4.7">I think why it felt very important to me</text><text start="254.4" dur="2.66">was</text><text start="257.959" dur="5.861">somehow the I think the sto has done an</text><text start="261.66" dur="3.96">amazing job of being meta-political and</text><text start="263.82" dur="3.78">not getting partisan captured and being</text><text start="265.62" dur="3.78">able to have people that are</text><text start="267.6" dur="4.56">traditionally far right and far left</text><text start="269.4" dur="6.84">both be in conversations together but</text><text start="272.16" dur="7.319">the stowa rebel wisdom IDW corner of the</text><text start="276.24" dur="5.58">universe that I have found myself in</text><text start="279.479" dur="4.981">has a leaning in the anti-woke direction</text><text start="281.82" dur="5.04">that affects a number of things racial</text><text start="284.46" dur="4.44">conflict being one of them and it felt</text><text start="286.86" dur="5.399">like it was</text><text start="288.9" dur="5.579">um attack of the worst elements of</text><text start="292.259" dur="4.321">wokism without a deep understanding of</text><text start="294.479" dur="3.301">the history or the real issues and kind</text><text start="296.58" dur="2.58">of straw Manning rather than steel</text><text start="297.78" dur="3.6">Manning and one of the things we talk</text><text start="299.16" dur="4.5">about so much is let&apos;s make sure</text><text start="301.38" dur="4.14">to not be adding to culture wars that</text><text start="303.66" dur="3.84">we&apos;re truly steel Manning the other</text><text start="305.52" dur="4.26">perspective to be able to find synthesis</text><text start="307.5" dur="4.5">and it felt really important to in this</text><text start="309.78" dur="5.699">corner of the universe Steel Man the</text><text start="312.0" dur="6.0">history of the racial conflict issues</text><text start="315.479" dur="4.621">and the unique American case to say what</text><text start="318.0" dur="4.08">is the actual problem space here what</text><text start="320.1" dur="3.599">has what are the solutions that have</text><text start="322.08" dur="4.26">been tried why would people not feel</text><text start="323.699" dur="5.041">good about those Solutions so as to be</text><text start="326.34" dur="3.72">able to see how to forward it</text><text start="328.74" dur="3.84">um most of the questions that people</text><text start="330.06" dur="4.139">have today about how do we actually</text><text start="332.58" dur="3.839">solve these problems or what about</text><text start="334.199" dur="3.661">somebody else&apos;s</text><text start="336.419" dur="3.541">um thoughts on the history will be</text><text start="337.86" dur="4.559">directed at Gilbert because he has the</text><text start="339.96" dur="5.04">expertise here and I&apos;m mostly here to</text><text start="342.419" dur="4.141">support facilitate</text><text start="345.0" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="346.56" dur="3.3">I think one thing I want to just comment</text><text start="348.72" dur="4.68">on is</text><text start="349.86" dur="6.24">I get two comments almost equally often</text><text start="353.4" dur="5.1">because of what I do have some expertise</text><text start="356.1" dur="5.159">on in terms of global catastrophic risk</text><text start="358.5" dur="4.74">there are people who are working in say</text><text start="361.259" dur="4.081">The Cutting Edge of AI risk or synthetic</text><text start="363.24" dur="3.6">biology risk and they&apos;re like why are</text><text start="365.34" dur="4.32">you why would you waste any time</text><text start="366.84" dur="4.62">focusing on an issue like racism that</text><text start="369.66" dur="3.3">does not portend the ability to kill all</text><text start="371.46" dur="2.88">life on the planet in the next few years</text><text start="372.96" dur="4.5">when we&apos;re at the brink of possible</text><text start="374.34" dur="5.04">nuclear war between NATO and Russia that</text><text start="377.46" dur="3.12">both have strategic nuclear arsenals and</text><text start="379.38" dur="2.879">when we&apos;re doing gain of function</text><text start="380.58" dur="3.54">research with synthetic biology and</text><text start="382.259" dur="3.78">leaky Labs that could kill almost</text><text start="384.12" dur="4.5">everything and the speed of AI is what</text><text start="386.039" dur="4.801">it is you could work on those like</text><text start="388.62" dur="4.98">racism is just not a comparably</text><text start="390.84" dur="4.199">destructive issue to all life that&apos;s and</text><text start="393.6" dur="3.84">how close we are with planetary</text><text start="395.039" dur="3.841">boundaries on catastrophic die off of</text><text start="397.44" dur="3.66">dead zones and whatever</text><text start="398.88" dur="5.06">I get another perspective that says it</text><text start="401.1" dur="2.84">is a privileged</text><text start="404.34" dur="3.54">position to be able to think about</text><text start="406.02" dur="3.78">existential risk in the future because</text><text start="407.88" dur="4.439">people who are</text><text start="409.8" dur="5.28">living in the ghetto or comfortably in a</text><text start="412.319" dur="5.281">refugee camp or whatever are facing uh</text><text start="415.08" dur="4.44">existential risk every single day that</text><text start="417.6" dur="4.68">is not a future forecasted thing it&apos;s a</text><text start="419.52" dur="5.64">real Here and Now eminent reality</text><text start="422.28" dur="6.3">that you&apos;re taking attention away from</text><text start="425.16" dur="5.64">to focus on hypothetical things and</text><text start="428.58" dur="5.399">specifically systemic racism through the</text><text start="430.8" dur="6.119">system called police and the judicial</text><text start="433.979" dur="5.701">system in many areas of the U.S is a</text><text start="436.919" dur="4.981">existential risk to many people today</text><text start="439.68" dur="4.019">so like both of those have some truth to</text><text start="441.9" dur="4.68">them and</text><text start="443.699" dur="5.101">uh I think the thing that has</text><text start="446.58" dur="4.019">called me is how all of the issues are</text><text start="448.8" dur="3.36">interconnected the meaningfulness of all</text><text start="450.599" dur="2.88">of them and how we can try to pay</text><text start="452.16" dur="3.24">attention to that hopefully more</text><text start="453.479" dur="5.22">competently with finite attention and</text><text start="455.4" dur="4.62">finite energy one thing that I will say</text><text start="458.699" dur="3.661">about</text><text start="460.02" dur="4.14">why is it actually a really big deal</text><text start="462.36" dur="4.26">Beyond</text><text start="464.16" dur="4.5">why is it a really big deal to</text><text start="466.62" dur="4.5">the overall</text><text start="468.66" dur="5.7">thriving of life on the planet long term</text><text start="471.12" dur="5.76">not just the individual</text><text start="474.36" dur="4.559">people and populations that it is</text><text start="476.88" dur="4.2">affecting in the U.S today or the</text><text start="478.919" dur="5.041">history of it is</text><text start="481.08" dur="4.86">when we see how much an issue like race</text><text start="483.96" dur="4.56">in the U.S</text><text start="485.94" dur="4.979">factoring how</text><text start="488.52" dur="3.84">in how you cannot separate the</text><text start="490.919" dur="5.041">institution of the US and its history</text><text start="492.36" dur="5.64">from systemic institutionalized racial</text><text start="495.96" dur="3.66">violence</text><text start="498.0" dur="3.599">um and yet you also can&apos;t separate it</text><text start="499.62" dur="4.74">from leading the world in Democratic</text><text start="501.599" dur="4.621">process rather than autocratic process</text><text start="504.36" dur="3.179">today and both are true</text><text start="506.22" dur="5.46">if</text><text start="507.539" dur="7.981">it is at the heart of political divides</text><text start="511.68" dur="7.02">in the west that can break the capacity</text><text start="515.52" dur="6.36">to find any way forward of democracy</text><text start="518.7" dur="4.86">itself which ends up leading way for</text><text start="521.88" dur="2.76">autocracy to be the only way forward in</text><text start="523.56" dur="2.7">which case they&apos;re like we just don&apos;t</text><text start="524.64" dur="4.44">care what you think this is what rule of</text><text start="526.26" dur="4.8">law is on from a top-down way that</text><text start="529.08" dur="5.34">portends something for the environment</text><text start="531.06" dur="5.76">and for nuclear issues and everything so</text><text start="534.42" dur="4.08">if democracy is not a viable system that</text><text start="536.82" dur="3.72">matters for every other issue for</text><text start="538.5" dur="4.26">democracy to be a viable system we&apos;ve</text><text start="540.54" dur="3.66">got to actually be able to take issues</text><text start="542.76" dur="3.84">that are at the hardware Democratic</text><text start="544.2" dur="4.98">institutions like this and say can we</text><text start="546.6" dur="4.919">forward this in a meaningful way so</text><text start="549.18" dur="5.339">there was statement of the color line</text><text start="551.519" dur="4.741">being defining of the 20th century</text><text start="554.519" dur="3.181">and the possibility that the color line</text><text start="556.26" dur="4.62">is actually one of the defining features</text><text start="557.7" dur="5.34">of the 21st century as well uh is part</text><text start="560.88" dur="4.56">of why this is such a important</text><text start="563.04" dur="4.2">meaningful conversation to me so with</text><text start="565.44" dur="3.6">that Gilbert</text><text start="567.24" dur="4.02">thank you for being here and would love</text><text start="569.04" dur="4.2">to hear your opening thoughts before we</text><text start="571.26" dur="6.66">jump to questions</text><text start="573.24" dur="6.84">thank you very much Daniel uh and uh</text><text start="577.92" dur="7.5">good evening it&apos;s evening here in the</text><text start="580.08" dur="7.74">Bahamas uh so good evening to everyone</text><text start="585.42" dur="5.58">um it&apos;s a great pleasure great pleasure</text><text start="587.82" dur="6.32">to be here and it&apos;s always a great</text><text start="591.0" dur="6.54">pleasure to be able to engage in</text><text start="594.14" dur="9.699">conversation in which uh the presumption</text><text start="597.54" dur="8.64">is not uh that we&apos;ll never get along</text><text start="603.839" dur="5.341">um it may be that we won&apos;t find</text><text start="606.18" dur="5.7">agreement but the agreement is that we</text><text start="609.18" dur="5.94">should return tomorrow and continue our</text><text start="611.88" dur="8.76">discussion and it seems to me that that</text><text start="615.12" dur="8.64">is a foundation of uh JS Mills uh notion</text><text start="620.64" dur="5.759">of the marketplace of ideas in which</text><text start="623.76" dur="6.42">people come to the Town Square to</text><text start="626.399" dur="7.261">exchange between themselves without the</text><text start="630.18" dur="7.44">notion of winning uh but with the idea</text><text start="633.66" dur="7.38">and the ideal of understanding and</text><text start="637.62" dur="6.48">protecting each other&apos;s uh capacity and</text><text start="641.04" dur="6.299">opportunity to gain understanding and so</text><text start="644.1" dur="5.479">I I appreciate that

start="658.82" dur="8.259">we got into several discussions on</text><text start="662.7" dur="8.34">variety of subjects but we he saw</text><text start="667.079" dur="6.681">certainly and I agreed that uh that this</text><text start="671.04" dur="6.06">was a crucial topic which had to be</text><text start="673.76" dur="4.84">addressed for the reasons which he uh</text><text start="677.1" dur="3.84">which he has said</text><text start="678.6" dur="5.52">what I&apos;ve tried to do</text><text start="680.94" dur="4.32">is to distinguish between race and</text><text start="684.12"

these</text><text start="1120.2" dur="4.74">very strong positions on particular</text><text start="1122.6" dur="4.62">scenes and so he was talking about</text><text start="1124.94" dur="4.619">charter

has</text><text start="1264.86" dur="6.36">sort of migrated into such a cul-de-sac</text><text start="1268.059" dur="5.86">where people are not speaking really</text><text start="1271.22" dur="6.6">from the same position about from</text><text start="1273.919" dur="7.561">fundamental principles about some ideal</text><text start="1277.82" dur="6.239">which uh which everyone adheres to

dur="5.04">areas so just to kind of uh</text><text start="1327.14" dur="3.24">guide the conversation a bit</text><text start="1329.24" dur="2.64">it&apos;s so</text><text start="1330.38" dur="3.299">I think for many people it might be like</text><text start="1331.88" dur="4.2">why the do you start with talking</text><text start="1333.679" dur="3.901">about ancient China and Aristotle um</text><text start="1336.08" dur="3.78">when we&apos;re talking about the situation</text><text start="1337.58" dur="5.64">in the Americas and I</text><text start="1339.86" dur="5.04">I beg of everyone to have the benefit of</text><text start="1343.22" dur="4.38">the doubt and the attention span to</text><text start="1344.9" dur="4.94">follow what seems like a circuitous</text><text start="1347.6" dur="4.68">route because it is actually</text><text start="1349.84" dur="4.959">fascinatingly relevant and oftentimes</text><text start="1352.28" dur="4.68">when there&apos;s a wicked problem that seems</text><text start="1354.799" dur="3.961">intractable it&apos;s because the framing is</text><text start="1356.96" dur="3.66">wrong and we actually have to step out</text><text start="1358.76" dur="3.72">of the frame so it&apos;s interesting if we</text><text start="1360.62" dur="3.6">take Aristotle having been such an</text><text start="1362.48" dur="3.78">influence to Western thought and the</text><text start="1364.22" dur="5.04">idea of a natural slave that some people</text><text start="1366.26" dur="5.34">are disposed naturally as slaves and</text><text start="1369.26"

very</text><text start="1375.62" dur="4.799">very good frame by one of the leading</text><text start="1377.9" dur="3.84">thinkers to then have everybody seeking</text><text start="1380.419" dur="3.181">to answer that and then of course</text><text start="1381.74" dur="4.5">economic motive creates motivated</text><text start="1383.6" dur="5.579">reasoning and blah blah blah</text><text

is at least possible I think that&apos;s</text><text start="1472.4" dur="5.04">a very good thing to keep in mind</text><text start="1475.64" dur="3.06">Gilbert you went into the topic of</text><text start="1477.44" dur="3.599">schools</text><text start="1478.7" dur="3.78">and that&apos;s obviously one key thing and</text><text start="1481.039" dur="3.12">one of the questions someone asked here</text><text start="1482.48" dur="3.78">is about schools and I know one of your</text><text start="1484.159" dur="4.741">Solutions has to do with schools</text><text start="1486.26" dur="5.34">and that given that one of the biggest</text><text start="1488.9" dur="4.8">issues is not just could we make</text><text start="1491.6" dur="4.14">situations that have no institutional</text><text

start="1504.44" dur="3.479">wealth is a big thing the historical</text><text start="1505.88" dur="3.96">issue is where the reparations would</text><text start="1507.919" dur="5.341">ever come up that is such a</text><text start="1509.84" dur="5.04"> of a topic and you discussed</text><text start="1513.26" dur="3.72">in the previous one the difference</text><text start="1514.88" dur="8.52">between restitution compensation</text><text start="1516.98" dur="9.66">reparations but how do we make a path</text><text start="1523.4" dur="6.0">that does provide Fair quality of</text><text start="1526.64" dur="6.0">opportunity factoring how much that has</text><text start="1529.4" dur="5.159">been damaged in the past but that</text><text start="1532.64" dur="3.3">doesn&apos;t require some of the things that</text><text start="1534.559" dur="3.661">are more impossible to move through</text><text start="1535.94" dur="4.44">politically you have a model with the</text><text start="1538.22" dur="3.54">historically black colleges and</text><text start="1540.38" dur="2.64">universities that I think is really</text><text start="1541.76" dur="2.82">fascinating that I think is worth</text><text start="1543.02" dur="3.659">talking about here</text><text start="1544.58" dur="4.8">and as an entry someone asked us</text><text start="1546.679" dur="4.201">questions right I think one two if we</text><text start="1549.38" dur="3.6">could get to historically black colleges</text><text start="1550.88" dur="4.74">as a second topic and the first is</text><text start="1552.98" dur="4.92">someone asked Kevin</text><text start="1555.62" dur="8.22">is there an ideal way to teach about</text><text start="1557.9" dur="7.74">race and racial conflict in schools and</text><text start="1563.84" dur="3.24">he says ideally throughout different</text><text start="1565.64" dur="3.6">levels of cognitive and emotional</text><text start="1567.08" dur="3.62">development Elementary up through Middle</text><text start="1569.24" dur="3.6">School and High School</text><text start="1570.7" dur="4.78">obviously you have taught about this</text><text start="1572.84" dur="3.78">topic in a university setting uh</text><text start="1575.48" dur="3.179">different states teach about it</text><text start="1576.62" dur="3.72">differently in the US currently is there</text><text start="1578.659" dur="3.201">anything you&apos;d like to share around how</text><text start="1580.34" dur="4.92">the</text><text start="1581.86" dur="5.38">uh school education of this topic</text><text start="1585.26" dur="4.26">could be</text><text start="1587.24" dur="6.299">meaningfully better</text><text start="1589.52" dur="7.38">yes there&apos;s uh the tedious hermeneutics</text><text start="1593.539" dur="6.781">uh which goes into this because one has</text><text start="1596.9" dur="6.659">to perform a kind of unraveling first</text><text start="1600.32" dur="6.3">and then come forward uh uh because</text><text start="1603.559" dur="4.98">people are ensconced in the points of</text><text start="1606.62" dur="6.0">views with which they have been raised</text><text start="1608.539" dur="4.821">and uh there are social</text><text start="1612.62" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="1613.36" dur="6.34">structures which seem to confirm appear</text><text start="1616.64" dur="4.86">to confirm people&apos;s prejudices in many</text><text start="1619.7" dur="4.62">respects</text><text start="1621.5" dur="4.799">um I don&apos;t speak of racism as an emotion</text><text start="1624.32" dur="4.979">for instance</text><text start="1626.299" dur="6.061">um but rather as a set of a set of</text><text start="1629.299" dur="5.781">structures everyone is prejudiced so for</text><text start="1632.36" dur="5.58">instance you hear the topic well</text><text start="1635.08" dur="5.86">everyone can be racist or you know</text><text start="1637.94" dur="4.979">Reverse Racism or that sort of thing so</text><text start="1640.94" dur="4.26">one of the things we would try to</text><text start="1642.919" dur="4.201">examine without insisting that we had</text><text start="1645.2" dur="4.8">the right point of view certainly when I</text><text start="1647.12" dur="3.96">was teaching and in this case I was</text><text start="1650.0" dur="3.9">teaching</text><text start="1651.08" dur="5.64">The Faculty to teach</text><text start="1653.9" dur="5.519">to to explore ways of teaching about</text><text start="1656.72" dur="4.559">race and one of the things I said was</text><text start="1659.419" dur="4.801">well let&apos;s let&apos;s look at it</text><text start="1661.279" dur="5.421">everyone has prejudices who cannot</text><text start="1664.22" dur="5.28">Escape that black people have prejudices</text><text start="1666.7" dur="4.54">white people have prejudices women men</text><text start="1669.5" dur="3.179">all these sorts of things but on the</text><text start="1671.24" dur="3.72">racial question</text><text start="1672.679" dur="5.341">it seems to me that when a person has a</text><text start="1674.96" dur="4.98">Prejudice and also has the power and</text><text start="1678.02" dur="5.58">there&apos;s a structure that allows that</text><text start="1679.94" dur="7.26">power to exercise to make preferences on</text><text start="1683.6" dur="5.939">the basis of race that that is racism</text><text start="1687.2" dur="6.12">so that&apos;s not an emotion or a feeling</text><text start="1689.539" dur="7.02">that is Prejudice with the vertical of</text><text start="1693.32" dur="5.76">power to be able to apply that prejudice</text><text start="1696.559" dur="5.041">in the apportionment of benefits in a</text><text start="1699.08" dur="4.38">society where everyone pays the same</text><text start="1701.6" dur="4.559">taxes but only one group of people</text><text start="1703.46" dur="5.76">because of that prejudice and its</text><text start="1706.159" dur="6.841">relative the power associated with it to</text><text start="1709.22" dur="6.3">be able to uh to coordinate outcomes and</text><text start="1713.0" dur="4.2">if we think of it like that it seems to</text><text start="1715.52" dur="4.5">me we get to some very interesting</text><text start="1717.2" dur="5.219">places about the notion of racism it</text><text start="1720.02" dur="5.759">doesn&apos;t let black people off the hook</text><text start="1722.419" dur="6.841">uh for being unkind and for having you</text><text start="1725.779" dur="6.241">know virulent prejudices but it also</text><text start="1729.26" dur="4.14">is able to demonstrate you&apos;re also able</text><text start="1732.02" dur="4.56">to isolate</text><text start="1733.4" dur="5.94">how power structures work in such a way</text><text start="1736.58" dur="6.959">that certain people can enact their</text><text start="1739.34" dur="6.42">prejudices on everyone uh whereas other</text><text start="1743.539" dur="4.081">people have prejudices but they can&apos;t</text><text start="1745.76" dur="4.44">enact them they don&apos;t have the power</text><text start="1747.62" dur="3.36">structure or the vertical of power to do</text><text start="1750.2" dur="4.56">so</text><text start="1750.98" dur="8.1">so that&apos;s one little frame that we speak</text><text start="1754.76" dur="7.44">about one of the things I speak to to uh</text><text start="1759.08" dur="4.94">to Black Americans about is the term</text><text start="1762.2" dur="5.459">African-American</text><text start="1764.02" dur="6.519">and I try to explain that</text><text start="1767.659" dur="5.041">if you think about uh</text><text start="1770.539" dur="4.02">um the continent of Africa before the</text><text start="1772.7" dur="5.76">17th century</text><text start="1774.559" dur="8.041">the the average person in Benin</text><text start="1778.46" dur="6.599">could never see himself as an African</text><text start="1782.6" dur="5.24">he saw himself within the terms of this</text><text start="1785.059" dur="6.781">particular tribe so if you were a tiff</text><text start="1787.84" dur="7.719">uh in what is now Nigeria or Igbo or you</text><text start="1791.84" dur="6.6">were a Bassa in what is now Liberia or</text><text start="1795.559" dur="6.48">or a VI in one of those places that&apos;s</text><text start="1798.44" dur="6.78">what you saw yourself as and you saw if</text><text start="1802.039" dur="5.581">you were a Vassar you saw the vi as</text><text start="1805.22" dur="4.559">different from yourself as the Mongolian</text><text start="1807.62" dur="4.86">from the Swiss</text><text start="1809.779" dur="6.12">because you these are ancestral cultures</text><text start="1812.48" dur="7.26">with long oral histories and these oral</text><text start="1815.899" dur="6.601">histories and ancestralism created in</text><text start="1819.74" dur="6.299">fact a sociological divide between these</text><text start="1822.5" dur="6.36">uh these uh uh micro civilizations in</text><text start="1826.039" dur="3.841">some cases uh that separated them from</text><text start="1828.86" dur="3.78">one another</text><text start="1829.88" dur="5.0">so that the argument came to me that uh</text><text start="1832.64" dur="4.62">well the Italians call themselves</text><text start="1834.88" dur="4.24">Italian-American the you know the French</text><text start="1837.26" dur="4.139">call themselves French American although</text><text start="1839.12" dur="3.84">I&apos;ve never heard of French American call</text><text start="1841.399" dur="4.921">themselves a French American I think</text><text start="1842.96" dur="4.56">most of the Irish uh uh do that and the</text><text start="1846.32" dur="4.26">Italians</text><text start="1847.52" dur="4.86">and Thomas has a wonderful some</text><text start="1850.58" dur="3.36">wonderful writing about that actually</text><text start="1852.38" dur="4.32">and</text><text start="1853.94" dur="5.88">um uh I would say to them well</text><text start="1856.7" dur="5.88">you&apos;ve it seems to me you&apos;ve begged the</text><text start="1859.82" dur="5.459">question because if in fact we&apos;re going</text><text start="1862.58" dur="6.54">to claim that the history has been a</text><text start="1865.279" dur="6.0">sort of lost right or at least uh uh</text><text start="1869.12" dur="5.159">there&apos;s been a a separation a</text><text start="1871.279" dur="6.301">displacement and a marginalization from</text><text start="1874.279" dur="5.52">the lines and the tracery of the history</text><text start="1877.58" dur="5.699">it seems very much to me that you have</text><text start="1879.799" dur="5.521">to leave it that way and not use it you</text><text start="1883.279" dur="4.861">know so in the miniature as a bandage</text><text start="1885.32" dur="5.219">for that and rather leave it the way it</text><text start="1888.14" dur="5.46">is so it would mean that the blacks are</text><text start="1890.539" dur="4.981">just Americans because they can&apos;t make a</text><text start="1893.6" dur="4.02">historical reference to a cultural or</text><text start="1895.52" dur="5.039">ethnological reference</text><text start="1897.62" dur="5.4">um to their point of origin and that</text><text start="1900.559" dur="5.761">forces the question to have to come up</text><text start="1903.02" dur="4.86">over and over again and forces of public</text><text start="1906.32" dur="2.579">debate now you may not agree with that</text><text start="1907.88" dur="3.659">but that&apos;s</text><text start="1908.899" dur="5.341">in the framing it seems to me that in</text><text start="1911.539" dur="4.74">all these little areas one has to try</text><text start="1914.24" dur="4.559">and work these things up this is part of</text><text start="1916.279" dur="5.041">the walking back of the intrustication</text><text start="1918.799" dur="5.341">of what is I think are a set of bad</text><text start="1921.32" dur="5.88">arguments that sit on top of uh that sit</text><text start="1924.14" dur="5.639">on top of uh the history last point</text><text start="1927.2" dur="3.959">at Daniel in our discussion I made this</text><text start="1929.779" dur="4.62">distinction</text><text start="1931.159" dur="4.201">uh this notion that</text><text start="1934.399" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="1935.36" dur="4.4">that somehow</text><text start="1937.279" dur="4.201">people who were</text><text start="1939.76" dur="3.88">virulent</text><text start="1941.48" dur="5.64">um enslavers</text><text start="1943.64" dur="5.58">and also hypocritical enslavers</text><text start="1947.12" dur="3.48">that they were simply people of their</text><text start="1949.22" dur="4.26">time</text><text start="1950.6" dur="4.92">and uh I reject that one rather</text><text start="1953.48" dur="4.14">vigorously</text><text start="1955.52" dur="5.22">um and I think we were able to</text><text start="1957.62" dur="6.659">demonstrate if you juxtapose the lives</text><text start="1960.74" dur="7.08">of Lords Mansfield and and Thomas</text><text start="1964.279" dur="8.28">Jefferson Thomas Jefferson takes a young</text><text start="1967.82" dur="8.52">girl who&apos;s 14 and uh he makes her his</text><text

remember Joseph Ellis the</text><text start="1983.299" dur="4.801">historian I met him when I first came to</text><text start="1985.82" dur="3.78">America and he was talking about</text><text

this book</text><text start="2000.34" dur="6.24">and it was a politics and prose in</text><text start="2002.74" dur="7.02">Washington DC I think and uh at that</text><text start="2006.58" dur="6.36">discussion he said something like</text><text start="2009.76" dur="5.519">Jefferson was far too moral to engage in</text><text start="2012.94" dur="3.599">an immoral relationship with an underage</text><text start="2015.279" dur="4.321">child</text><text start="2016.539" dur="7.201">and I didn&apos;t know what to do as myself I</text><text start="2019.6" dur="6.72">just come from the

that this is part of the</text><text start="2039.84" dur="6.819">asymmetry and the what I&apos;ve referred to</text><text start="2043.6" dur="5.22">as monumentalist history so there&apos;s a</text><text start="2046.659" dur="4.44">relation to history in which people wish</text><text start="2048.82" dur="4.5">there it to be Monumental and when I say</text><text start="2051.099"

all sorts</text><text start="2416.8" dur="4.62">of questions about integration whether</text><text start="2418.72" dur="5.04">in fact there&apos;s a black community where</text><text start="2421.42" dur="5.1">the blacks work together whether they</text><text start="2423.76" dur="5.22">are systems that aggregate black wealth</text><text start="2426.52" dur="5.16">effectively whether the by black</text><text start="2428.98" dur="5.7">movement which is seems to be more of a</text><text start="2431.68" dur="6.0">kind of folk sort of thing rather than a</text><text start="2434.68" dur="4.8">major economic initiative whether that&apos;s</text><text start="2437.68" dur="4.02">an issue</text><text start="2439.48" dur="6.0">um when you run the numbers it&apos;s</text><text start="2441.7" dur="5.159">something like one in 60 or 70 blacks is</text><text start="2445.48" dur="3.72">a millionaire</text><text start="2446.859" dur="5.581">and so it raises the question if there</text><text start="2449.2" dur="7.52">was a desire to be a real community in</text><text start="2452.44" dur="7.22">the sense of you say listen America</text><text start="2456.72" dur="6.76">doesn&apos;t mean we cannot have our own</text><text start="2459.66" dur="6.88">build our own and integrate that with</text><text start="2463.48" dur="5.94">the rest of society because if you&apos;re in</text><text start="2466.54" dur="5.64">a negotiation and as a diplomat this</text><text start="2469.42" dur="5.1">comes home to me as a methodology</text><text start="2472.18" dur="4.86">if you have nothing on your side of the</text><text start="2474.52" dur="5.88">table or if what you have on your side</text><text start="2477.04" dur="6.6">of the table is disparate and dissipated</text><text start="2480.4" dur="5.76">across a vast panoply of people with</text><text start="2483.64" dur="5.1">differing opinions who can&apos;t cohere</text><text start="2486.16" dur="4.86">around the center principles then you&apos;re</text><text start="2488.74" dur="3.18">not going to achieve anything in the</text><text start="2491.02" dur="3.36">debate</text><text

problematic thing but the</text><text start="2499.72" dur="6.06">hbcus open up an opportunity it seems to</text><text start="2502.78" dur="5.16">me uh to change that in the sense that</text><text start="2505.78" dur="4.92">they&apos;re already considered black</text><text start="2507.94" dur="5.88">schools and colleges although many of</text><text start="2510.7" dur="6.18">them are land grant or funded uh not</text><text start="2513.82" dur="5.4">essentially or historically by blacks at</text><text start="2516.88" dur="4.8">all but let us assume that they are</text><text start="2519.22" dur="4.139">black colleges and universities for the</text><text start="2521.68" dur="4.679">purposes of discussion</text><text start="2523.359" dur="6.121">many of them are also in areas where</text><text start="2526.359" dur="5.22">they have large uh</text><text start="2529.48" dur="4.859">um rule they&apos;re not in urban spaces</text><text start="2531.579" dur="5.04">they&apos;re in large uh sort of places where</text><text start="2534.339" dur="4.02">you have lots of land many of them have</text><text start="2536.619" dur="3.901">lots of property and that kind of thing</text><text start="2538.359" dur="5.581">and it seems to me it would be an</text><text start="2540.52" dur="6.3">interesting sort of thing if they were</text><text start="2543.94" dur="6.899">to focus on things like</text><text start="2546.82" dur="6.539">the 600 000 technical jobs in the United</text><text start="2550.839" dur="3.541">States that Americans cannot currently</text><text start="2553.359" dur="4.681">fill</text><text start="2554.38" dur="6.54">and begin to educate with the aim of</text><text start="2558.04" dur="4.86">filling those positions after all is a</text><text start="2560.92" dur="4.32">way in which society is competitive and</text><text start="2562.9" dur="4.86">this would give a competitive advantage</text><text start="2565.24" dur="4.74">and any negotiation you have to have</text><text start="2567.76" dur="4.38">leverage and this would provide leverage</text><text start="2569.98" dur="4.139">in the sense that blacks would still be</text><text start="2572.14" dur="4.02">integrated in American society in a much</text><text start="2574.119" dur="4.921">higher level and with a set of</text><text start="2576.16" dur="4.86">defensible skills all right defensible</text><text start="2579.04" dur="6.18">skills which means that blacks could not</text><text start="2581.02" dur="7.5">be ignored and it seems to me that uh if</text><text start="2585.22" dur="6.599">one were to build uh such a a a a a</text><text start="2588.52" dur="5.22">construct around uh the historically</text><text start="2591.819" dur="5.581">black college and mind you they had it</text><text start="2593.74" dur="6.119">in Dentistry and Medicine and mortuary</text><text start="2597.4" dur="5.64">science these were the things that</text><text start="2599.859" dur="5.821">flowed into the 50 or 60 black</text><text start="2603.04" dur="4.5">communities in the Antebellum Period all</text><text start="2605.68" dur="3.78">right to distinguish them</text><text start="2607.54" dur="4.38">in America but those people did not</text><text start="2609.46" dur="4.44">divide themselves from America they did</text><text start="2611.92" dur="4.74">not separate themselves from America</text><text start="2613.9" dur="4.5">they did not see them the the white</text><text start="2616.66" dur="4.14">brothers and sisters as their enemies</text><text start="2618.4" dur="4.8">they simply thought that we had to build</text><text start="2620.8" dur="4.319">our own circumstances LED them to that</text><text start="2623.2" dur="4.86">and if you think of coming out of</text><text start="2625.119" dur="5.101">slavery for several centuries and coming</text><text start="2628.06" dur="5.34">out of the brutal period of a Civil War</text><text start="2630.22" dur="6.0">and out of that Civil War not asking for</text><text start="2633.4" dur="4.919">any benefits any help or anything of</text><text start="2636.22" dur="4.2">that sort and going out and building</text><text start="2638.319" dur="4.081">those communities and then educating</text><text start="2640.42" dur="4.74">themselves to be able to be successful</text><text start="2642.4" dur="6.54">in those communities it seems to me that</text><text start="2645.16" dur="6.36">that is the greatest greatest ever</text><text start="2648.94" dur="4.86">um uh instantiation and exhibition of</text><text start="2651.52" dur="4.94">the American values in the history of</text><text start="2653.8" dur="2.66">the United States</text><text start="2656.92" dur="3.679">I&apos;m sorry I went on a bit there</text><text start="2661.119" dur="5.101">Gilbert I have a question for you that</text><text start="2663.099" dur="6.661">actually I think a lot of people might</text><text start="2666.22" dur="6.3">also have I wanted to just underscore</text><text start="2669.76" dur="4.559">briefly one thing that you said</text><text start="2672.52" dur="3.78">um in case it wasn&apos;t totally obvious for</text><text start="2674.319" dur="3.661">everyone that I think is so</text><text start="2676.3" dur="3.539">fundamental when you said that Thomas</text><text start="2677.98" dur="4.94">Saul gave a history of slavery but he</text><text start="2679.839" dur="6.361">kept it separate from racism and that</text><text start="2682.92" dur="5.62">when you combine</text><text start="2686.2" dur="4.74">the Aristotelian concept of a natural</text><text start="2688.54" dur="4.44">slave some people are naturally disposed</text><text start="2690.94" dur="3.96">to slavery and it&apos;s actually kind of</text><text start="2692.98" dur="3.3">best suited for them because they cannot</text><text start="2694.9" dur="2.52">sovereignly figure out what to do with</text><text start="2696.28" dur="4.14">themselves</text><text start="2697.42" dur="4.5">when you combine that with</text><text start="2700.42" dur="3.78">uh</text><text start="2701.92" dur="3.84">Darwin and kind of the early natural</text><text start="2704.2" dur="3.6">science that was heading in the</text><text start="2705.76" dur="4.2">direction of Darwin with the motivated</text><text start="2707.8" dur="3.66">reasoning with the Declaration of</text><text start="2709.96" dur="4.139">Independence you get something so</text><text start="2711.46" dur="6.78">fascinating and unique and gruesome yes</text><text start="2714.099" dur="6.301">where like if Genghis Khan has slaves he</text><text start="2718.24" dur="3.66">didn&apos;t say all men are created equal and</text><text start="2720.4" dur="3.12">all deserve life liberty in the pursuit</text><text start="2721.9" dur="3.3">of happiness he was brutal and</text><text start="2723.52" dur="3.42">he embraced brutality and it&apos;s like okay</text><text start="2725.2" dur="3.659">he&apos;s a brittle dude</text><text start="2726.94" dur="4.74">um and he was being brutal across racial</text><text start="2728.859" dur="4.141">lines absolutely but if you say all men</text><text start="2731.68" dur="3.179">are created equal</text><text start="2733.0" dur="3.359">all deserve life liberty and the pursuit</text><text start="2734.859" dur="3.841">of happiness these people are slaves</text><text start="2736.359" dur="4.861">because they aren&apos;t men right because we</text><text start="2738.7" dur="4.139">we&apos;re actually having to say in order to</text><text start="2741.22" dur="3.3">keep intellectual congruency with all</text><text start="2742.839" dur="4.201">men are created equal we have to</text><text start="2744.52" dur="5.339">actually make them some evolutionarily</text><text start="2747.04" dur="5.4">lower type of animal that is a place</text><text start="2749.859" dur="5.581">where slavery with that other value</text><text start="2752.44" dur="5.879">system requires a philosophic</text><text start="2755.44" dur="5.04">formalization of racism that is really</text><text start="2758.319" dur="4.26">uniquely egregious and terrible and the</text><text start="2760.48" dur="4.859">Persistence of that that is still felt</text><text start="2762.579" dur="4.621">today is so up and like I just</text><text start="2765.339" dur="3.301">want it&apos;s just such an important point I</text><text start="2767.2" dur="2.879">just want to like acknowledge what an</text><text start="2768.64" dur="3.78">important point that is because it is</text><text start="2770.079" dur="4.681">very easy to bring up the point there&apos;s</text><text start="2772.42" dur="4.08">always been slavery which is true</text><text start="2774.76" dur="6.54">um but there has not always been a</text><text start="2776.5" dur="9.18">racial philosophy of slavery that had</text><text start="2781.3" dur="6.18">that sub-human egregiousness to it right</text><text start="2785.68" dur="3.96">um so I just want to like underscore</text><text start="2787.48" dur="4.8">that and say I think</text><text start="2789.64" dur="4.62">any remnants of that being fully</text><text start="2792.28" dur="3.839">uprooted and

dur="4.52">now where my question is</text><text start="2811.48" dur="4.5">for you</text><text start="2813.48" dur="5.08">in some ways there are issues that I&apos;m</text><text start="2815.98"

dur="6.361">propositions that we brag about they</text><text start="3836.94" dur="6.24">they don&apos;t work and so in this case from</text><text start="3840.42" dur="6.3">the displaced environment

dur="5.719">that is the cycle and we have to somehow</text><text start="3852.96" dur="3.139">ignite that cycle</text><text start="3857.7" dur="3.84">there are so many questions that I want</text><text start="3859.619" dur="3.781">to ask regarding the real politic</text><text start="3861.54" dur="4.44">assessment of what it actually takes to</text><text start="3863.4" dur="5.04">do the thing since the ethics</text><text start="3865.98" dur="5.46">is usually considerations of symmetry</text><text start="3868.44" dur="6.06">but the ability for enactment is usually</text><text start="3871.44" dur="5.04">considerations of power and the bunch</text><text start="3874.5" dur="5.359">that I want to get into but in lieu of</text><text start="3876.48" dur="6.839">time I want to get to questions</text><text start="3879.859" dur="5.021">uh oh I&apos;ll paraphrase what you&apos;ve said</text><text start="3883.319" dur="6.181">overall because I think</text><text start="3884.88" dur="6.84">what you&apos;re saying so uh mirrors what I</text><text start="3889.5" dur="3.359">end up saying talking about meta crisis</text><text start="3891.72" dur="2.7">um</text><text start="3892.859" dur="2.7">there&apos;s not a theory of change because</text><text start="3894.42" dur="3.659">there&apos;s not one cause of the problem</text><text start="3895.559" dur="4.201">there&apos;s and there&apos;s not even one problem</text><text start="3898.079" dur="3.841">right there&apos;s many different aspects of</text><text start="3899.76" dur="4.02">problems there&apos;s many elements of it so</text><text start="3901.92" dur="3.78">there&apos;s an Ecology of theories of chains</text><text start="3903.78" dur="4.38">that are needed trying to get too</text><text start="3905.7" dur="3.659">reductive to what the solution is and</text><text start="3908.16" dur="2.459">even too reductive in the problem</text><text start="3909.359" dur="3.661">framing is then where people get</text><text start="3910.619" dur="3.601">polarized on the thing and so this is</text><text start="3913.02" dur="3.18">when you&apos;re saying you know a thousand</text><text start="3914.22" dur="3.78">points of light there&apos;s an Ecology of</text><text start="3916.2" dur="3.899">theories of change</text><text start="3918.0" dur="3.359">and there&apos;s this dialectical principle</text><text start="3920.099" dur="4.381">throughout everything you&apos;re saying</text><text start="3921.359" dur="4.801">which is don&apos;t generate enmity in the</text><text start="3924.48" dur="3.66">dominant culture while seeking to change</text><text start="3926.16" dur="3.48">the dominant culture</text><text start="3928.14" dur="2.699">um seek to change it don&apos;t you seek to</text><text start="3929.64" dur="3.0">get a piece of the pie and don&apos;t just</text><text start="3930.839" dur="3.661">seek to have your own segregated thing</text><text start="3932.64" dur="3.54">but don&apos;t create enmity with the thing</text><text start="3934.5" dur="3.66">that currently has more enactment power</text><text start="3936.18" dur="4.439">than you have it&apos;s</text><text start="3938.16" dur="5.399">it&apos;s not an answer it&apos;s a it&apos;s a set of</text><text start="3940.619" dur="4.261">considerations to hold and similarly</text><text start="3943.559" dur="3.0">when you talked about what should be</text><text start="3944.88" dur="3.239">done in Education you were saying don&apos;t</text><text start="3946.559" dur="3.841">just say man of their time because</text><text start="3948.119" dur="3.781">that&apos;s nonsense and yet I&apos;ve also heard</text><text start="3950.4" dur="3.6">you say at other times</text><text start="3951.9" dur="3.959">don&apos;t throw Jefferson out as purely evil</text><text start="3954.0" dur="3.18">you have to hold was a great man but not</text><text start="3955.859" dur="4.26">a good man so what I&apos;m hearing you say</text><text start="3957.18" dur="6.54">is in education share the authentic</text><text start="3960.119" dur="6.841">complexity don&apos;t share a weaponized</text><text start="3963.72" dur="4.74">uh a cited version that then has other</text><text start="3966.96" dur="3.0">people say hey you left out something</text><text start="3968.46" dur="3.379">critical and then they hold another side</text><text start="3969.96" dur="4.44">try to share</text><text start="3971.839" dur="4.301">inadequate complexity of the things so</text><text start="3974.4" dur="4.98">people don&apos;t reduce it to something that</text><text start="3976.14" dur="4.74">then polarizes and um it seems like what</text><text start="3979.38" dur="3.419">you&apos;re saying overall is it&apos;s complex</text><text start="3980.88" dur="3.36">how do we educate people into the</text><text start="3982.799" dur="2.941">authentic complexity and how do we</text><text start="3984.24" dur="3.78">generate solutions to deal with the</text><text start="3985.74" dur="4.559">authentic complexity and it is the</text><text start="3988.02" dur="4.519">reductive process itself that ends up</text><text start="3990.299" dur="6.3">leading to a lot of the intractable</text><text start="3992.539" dur="6.101">problems so I really appreciate that I</text><text start="3996.599" dur="4.561">wanted to ask when it came to questions</text><text start="3998.64" dur="4.56">um teams appropriate</text><text start="4001.16" dur="4.56">yeah</text><text start="4003.2" dur="4.98">people in the audience who are here who</text><text start="4005.72" dur="4.74">happen to be people of color if you have</text><text start="4008.18" dur="3.72">any questions or thoughts first I wanted</text><text start="4010.46" dur="3.54">to offer</text><text start="4011.9" dur="5.54">priority to that and then see if anybody</text><text start="4014.0" dur="3.44">else does in remaining time</text><text start="4021.559" dur="2.961">I have a question</text><text start="4024.559" dur="4.621">it&apos;s more along the lines of like sense</text><text start="4026.78" dur="5.16">making and communicating that synthesis</text><text start="4029.18" dur="4.02">because I worked in a space where I was</text><text start="4031.94" dur="2.94">helping</text><text start="4033.2" dur="4.68">um black Founders get funding some</text><text start="4034.88" dur="6.06">Mentor capital and I came across a lot</text><text start="4037.88" dur="5.4">of the underlying issues of why certain</text><text start="4040.94" dur="4.32">Founders have barriers and you know the</text><text start="4043.28" dur="4.44">education system Etc like why we had</text><text start="4045.26" dur="5.7">less founders of color in the pipeline</text><text start="4047.72" dur="5.339">and in the whole culture of polarization</text><text start="4050.96" dur="4.26">and people picking one side it&apos;s just so</text><text start="4053.059" dur="3.3">difficult to communicate truth without</text><text start="4055.22" dur="3.24">giving</text><text start="4056.359" dur="3.48">um a point to the other side like one</text><text start="4058.46" dur="3.3">example is</text><text start="4059.839" dur="4.02">um absent

their</text><text start="4066.02" dur="5.16">economic outcomes Etc so it&apos;s like how</text><text start="4068.78" dur="4.2">do we best communicate the truth of like</text><text start="4071.18" dur="3.48">what are real barriers that are</text><text start="4072.98" dur="4.139">impacting black people today without</text><text start="4074.66" dur="5.58">giving a point to like oh this is why</text><text start="4077.119" dur="5.521">racism exists so this is why like the</text><text start="4080.24" dur="4.2">culture is inherently bad in producing</text><text start="4082.64" dur="4.38">good people that are contributing to</text><text start="4084.44" dur="5.7">Society like I have found that very</text><text start="4087.02" dur="7.68">difficult in doing the work</text><text

there&apos;s so much Focus</text><text start="4704.719" dur="1.5">there</text><text start="4705.56" dur="2.639">um</text><text start="4706.219" dur="3.96">but I also heard you asking them a medic</text><text start="4708.199" dur="5.161">question which is</text><text start="4710.179" dur="5.761">how do you acknowledge yes</text><text start="4713.36" dur="4.08">there are a lot of black

dur="5.94">see they cause their own problems</text><text start="4722.78" dur="5.82">um and</text><text start="4725.9" dur="4.44">so I want to offer something to the</text><text start="4728.6" dur="3.66">communication because I heard of a medic</text><text start="4730.34" dur="4.8">question and I would say there are two</text><text start="4732.26" dur="6.06">things that I&apos;ll offer one is the</text><text start="4735.14" dur="5.64">question itself is really important</text><text start="4738.32" dur="4.68">which is</text><text start="4740.78" dur="4.56">how do I communicate to whoever I&apos;m</text><text start="4743.0" dur="5.1">communicating to while being cognizant</text><text start="4745.34" dur="5.76">of who is not my intended audience and</text><text start="4748.1" dur="6.18">what they do with that message it is</text><text start="4751.1" dur="5.4">mind-blowing to me how bad we are</text><text start="4754.28" dur="4.74">currently at paying attention to the</text><text start="4756.5" dur="5.219">effect of our message on our on whoever</text><text start="4759.02" dur="5.04">isn&apos;t our intended audience right</text><text start="4761.719" dur="6.181">and so we don&apos;t pay attention to the</text><text start="4764.06" dur="5.52">polarization and blowback of and to a</text><text start="4767.9" dur="3.6">large degree it&apos;s because of the actual</text><text start="4769.58" dur="3.78">structure of the political process and</text><text start="4771.5" dur="4.199">voting it&apos;s why people like Larry lessig</text><text start="4773.36" dur="5.24">really want ranked Choice voting is</text><text start="4775.699" dur="5.101">because it would disincentivize</text><text start="4778.6" dur="4.119">polarizing the other side against you</text><text start="4780.8" dur="3.84">currently there&apos;s only an incentive to</text><text start="4782.719" dur="3.301">get your support base to support you in</text><text

hate what you&apos;re doing and so</text><text start="4796.699" dur="3.901">the general principle for everyone</text><text start="4798.739" dur="3.301">communicating about everything to say</text><text start="4800.6" dur="3.3">okay who&apos;s my intended audience</text><text start="4802.04" dur="5.1">marketing 101 what am I saying to them</text><text start="4803.9" dur="5.4">what am I trying to do but also who else</text><text start="4807.14" dur="3.539">is going to hear this how are they going</text><text start="4809.3" dur="3.3">to respond because they&apos;re political</text><text start="4810.679" dur="3.181">actors and they&apos;re going to do stuff so</text><text start="4812.6" dur="3.36">how do I make sure I&apos;m paying attention</text><text start="4813.86" dur="5.22">to how everybody&apos;s going to hear it</text><text start="4815.96" dur="4.08">I so wish everyone thought about that a</text><text start="4819.08" dur="4.02">lot

that</text><text start="4862.699" dur="5.52">um so we&apos;re like okay what happened</text><text start="4864.8" dur="7.02">and when you look at the total amount of</text><text start="4868.219"

dur="6.359">because if you put together you know two</text><text start="6044.159" dur="6.121">incomes you reduce the social support</text><text start="6047.699" dur="4.94">and network that&apos;s

a</text><text start="6081.78" dur="5.52">tradition that probably started at the</text><text start="6085.32" dur="5.22">turn of the century but you it really</text><text start="6087.3" dur="8.16">gathers Steam from the 20s through the</text><text start="6090.54" dur="7.32">70s uh through the work of Elaine Locke</text><text start="6095.46" dur="4.5">for example you mentioned Du Bois

a</text><text start="6127.139" dur="4.261">people</text><text start="6127.92" dur="7.199">to create through cultural forms</text><text start="6131.4" dur="5.58">music and other forms that

dur="3.06">Ellison talks about this is not</text><text start="6141.48" dur="5.34">something that people highlight about</text><text start="6142.92" dur="9.0">Ellison&apos;s work is that he makes it clear</text><text start="6146.82" dur="7.379">that if you are able to get people to</text><text start="6151.92" dur="6.36">dance to your rhythms</text><text start="6154.199" dur="5.641">to uh uh play

dur="7.06">that you have actually imposed your</text><text start="6179.46" dur="6.0">values on the society</text><text start="6182.699" dur="4.92">so then you have a book like this</text><text

start="6598.139" dur="4.56">so on many of them ended up in the</text><text start="6600.3" dur="4.68">Caribbean and then a cross-pollination</text><text start="6602.699" dur="4.5">happened many

start="6617.88" dur="4.5">these sorts of places</text><text start="6619.98" dur="3.239">the point about music</text><text start="6622.38" dur="3.299">um</text><text start="6623.219" dur="4.681">is profoundly true</text><text start="6625.679" dur="5.101">and uh</text><text start="6627.9" dur="5.88">uh our your friend our mutual colleague</text><text start="6630.78" dur="7.14">the late Stanley Crouch uh spoke about</text><text start="6633.78" dur="6.72">this in terms of uh blues and jazz and</text><text start="6637.92" dur="3.96">it&apos;s uh cross-cultural influence all</text><text start="6640.5" dur="3.78">over the world</text><text start="6641.88" dur="5.7">coming from the Caribbean we say the</text><text start="6644.28" dur="6.48">same thing absolutely about Bob

when we</text><text start="6656.28" dur="7.379">these are all points of mitigation</text><text start="6660.42" dur="6.239">these are all acts of Integrity where</text><text start="6663.659" dur="5.161">the Fulfillment of talent</text><text start="6666.659" dur="4.801">right because that&apos;s another type of</text><text start="6668.82" dur="6.48">obligation human obligation</text><text start="6671.46" dur="7.08">Beyond above apart from race</text><text start="6675.3" dur="5.46">you have the acculturation of people</text><text start="6678.54" dur="4.74">existing within a particular social</text><text start="6680.76" dur="6.6">sphere that gives birth to something</text><text start="6683.28" dur="6.959">like blues or Jazz that&apos;s true</text><text start="6687.36" dur="5.819">but the talent in the execution of</text><text start="6690.239" dur="5.701">talent itself to the point of skill</text><text start="6693.179" dur="6.301">that&apos;s a human trait</text><text start="6695.94" dur="5.94">and so that reinstantiates human value</text><text start="6699.48" dur="6.54">in a non-racial way</text><text start="6701.88" dur="8.22">in such a way that a account basing</text><text start="6706.02" dur="6.08">could live in the Bahamas air next door</text><text start="6710.1" dur="6.78">to a 10 year old boy</text><text start="6712.1" dur="7.3">and tell him stories about how what he</text><text start="6716.88" dur="4.739">would call they got down in the old days</text><text start="6719.4" dur="4.5">by this time he was in a wheelchair and</text><text start="6721.619" dur="7.881">I used to push him along you were the 10</text><text start="6723.9" dur="9.54">year old boy yes oh my God man</text><text start="6729.5" dur="7.08">and so and so that influence was there</text><text start="6733.44" dur="6.779">but that influence did not exclude</text><text start="6736.58" dur="6.76">whites right that&apos;s right this is what&apos;s</text><text start="6740.219" dur="5.94">amazing it did not exclude whites right</text><text start="6743.34" dur="5.16">because they were there as musical</text><text start="6746.159" dur="6.781">arrangers as percussionists as managers</text><text start="6748.5" dur="6.719">as you know also as as as uh um uh</text><text start="6752.94" dur="6.0">beneficiaries listeners to the music and</text><text start="6755.219" dur="6.241">so on so you had this influence that</text><text start="6758.94" dur="7.08">exceeded the politics and the sociology</text><text start="6761.46" dur="6.659">of the dominant culture and so I I agree</text><text start="6766.02" dur="4.26">profoundly with that and I think what</text><text start="6768.119" dur="4.381">you have said</text><text start="6770.28" dur="5.399">uh really</text><text start="6772.5" dur="4.139">um aligns well and drives what I have</text><text start="6775.679" dur="3.0">said</text><text start="6776.639" dur="4.261">in the sense that I have said that this</text><text start="6778.679" dur="4.621">is what needs to happen</text><text start="6780.9" dur="5.64">and you have said here are examples</text><text start="6783.3" dur="4.2">where it is happening and how has</text><text start="6786.54" dur="4.44">happened</text><text start="6787.5" dur="7.26">and I think you you you read through my</text><text start="6790.98" dur="5.88">book uh the triptych papers yes if you</text><text start="6794.76" dur="6.0">remember at the back of the book</text><text start="6796.86" dur="6.06">I give about six examples of the types</text><text start="6800.76" dur="3.84">of things people are doing a nurse in</text><text start="6802.92" dur="4.02">Nigeria</text><text start="6804.6" dur="4.38">who was not only it not only became a</text><text start="6806.94" dur="5.759">nurse but a nutritionist</text><text start="6808.98" dur="6.239">and helped to build uh numbers of</text><text start="6812.699" dur="3.96">clinics Community clinics and that kind</text><text start="6815.219" dur="4.801">of thing developed a formula and went</text><text start="6816.659" dur="7.5">all over with that Tammy Sterling</text><text start="6820.02" dur="7.08">a friend of mine in Lafayette uh who</text><text start="6824.159" dur="5.46">started a reading group teaching Grant</text><text start="6827.1" dur="6.059">Marvel Collins was a hero</text><text start="6829.619" dur="5.821">so she taught uh these things uh reading</text><text start="6833.159" dur="5.58">to even grandmothers</text><text start="6835.44" dur="4.56">in their 70s and 80s would never read in</text><text start="6838.739" dur="4.641">their lives</text><text start="6840.0" dur="6.139">all right so that work is being done</text><text start="6843.38" dur="5.319">and we all know and that work is</text><text start="6846.139" dur="5.861">cross-racial there are people of every</text><text start="6848.699" dur="5.281">racial stripe that are doing that work</text><text start="6852.0" dur="5.04">and inspired by that work because that</text><text start="6853.98" dur="8.1">work operates at the level of human</text><text start="6857.04" dur="7.679">value not racial uh uh priorities and so</text><text start="6862.08" dur="4.619">these are examples of precisely what I</text><text start="6864.719" dur="4.92">think I&apos;ve been trying to say so I do</text><text start="6866.699" dur="6.301">think uh Thomas your remarks brings the</text><text start="6869.639" dur="5.281">entire discussion full circle</text><text start="6873.0" dur="4.8">and so we have what needs to be done</text><text start="6874.92" dur="6.299">what is happening and what more needs to</text><text start="6877.8" dur="5.339">be done and if I think if we operate on</text><text start="6881.219" dur="2.641">that principle what needs to happen now</text><text start="6883.139" dur="2.761">is</text><text start="6883.86" dur="4.56">groups of people in those thousand</text><text start="6885.9" dur="4.62">points of light have got to find a way</text><text start="6888.42" dur="4.739">to talk to each other right</text><text start="6890.52" dur="4.02">the young technologists who

start="6897.78" dur="5.52">about things and I said to them well</text><text start="6899.639" dur="6.681">listen why don&apos;t you</text><text start="6903.3" dur="6.48">make a market</text><text start="6906.32" dur="6.22">mechanisms are very important</text><text start="6909.78" dur="5.16">so why don&apos;t you make a list</text><text start="6912.54" dur="5.099">of those businesses</text><text start="6914.94" dur="6.199">which treat their customers including</text><text start="6917.639" dur="6.781">blacks well and appropriately</text><text start="6921.139" dur="5.261">I never saw the point my father trained</text><text start="6924.42" dur="4.38">me in this of going to a restaurant</text><text start="6926.4" dur="3.96">where you were not wanted going to tell</text><text start="6928.8" dur="4.74">where you were not wanted</text><text start="6930.36" dur="6.24">and you know this uh Dr King talks about</text><text start="6933.54" dur="5.28">this a little bit uh Harry Belafonte I</text><text start="6936.6" dur="4.5">had the incredible thing happen at</text><text start="6938.82" dur="5.16">George Mason University</text><text start="6941.1" dur="5.88">Vernon Jordan Harry belafontean</text><text start="6943.98" dur="6.0">Sydney Poitier came to George Mason</text><text start="6946.98" dur="5.219">uh University</text><text start="6949.98" dur="4.56">um and my mother had always told me that</text><text start="6952.199" dur="4.561">I was beautiful but I don&apos;t think that I</text><text start="6954.54" dur="6.0">could win any arguments on that night</text><text start="6956.76" dur="6.24">and um uh Harry Belafonte said the same</text><text start="6960.54" dur="4.139">thing that you said that Paul Robeson</text><text start="6963.0" dur="4.8">told him</text><text start="6964.679" dur="5.52">sing your music sing your songs get them</text><text start="6967.8" dur="5.22">to sing your songs and when they are</text><text start="6970.199" dur="5.52">singing your songs they have to ask you</text><text start="6973.02" dur="6.84">what Deo means</text><text start="6975.719" dur="6.241">what the Taliban means right and what</text><text start="6979.86" dur="5.04">daylight comes and we won&apos;t go home what</text><text start="6981.96" dur="4.739">does that mean and now you&apos;re engaged in</text><text start="6984.9" dur="4.44">a conversation where there&apos;s interest</text><text start="6986.699" dur="5.101">and feeling and you&apos;ve already touched</text><text start="6989.34" dur="4.92">the emotions of that person and so the</text><text start="6991.8" dur="3.72">disposition to conversation has been</text><text start="6994.26" dur="5.399">established</text><text start="6995.52" dur="6.719">and I do think that uh</text><text start="6999.659" dur="5.221">if somehow</text><text start="7002.239" dur="6.48">I resist movements</text><text start="7004.88" dur="5.52">I&apos;m not a movement person although I do</text><text start="7008.719" dur="6.321">think that</text><text start="7010.4" dur="7.799">people acting in their own spheres</text><text start="7015.04" dur="5.32">who on occasion were necessary and the</text><text start="7018.199" dur="5.401">opportunity presents itself</text><text start="7020.36" dur="6.42">work in collaboration with each other</text><text start="7023.6" dur="4.4">and if you can build systems that knit</text><text start="7026.78" dur="4.98">together</text><text start="7028.0" dur="5.5">informational platforms that allows me</text><text start="7031.76" dur="4.62">to know what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="7033.5" dur="5.82">and others to know what we are doing</text><text start="7036.38" dur="6.12">then this is how you

as we are just</text><text start="7051.38" dur="4.4">past the two hour mark and I think we</text><text start="7053.119" dur="4.741">had booked for 90 minutes so I&apos;m</text><text start="7055.78" dur="5.379">grateful of everybody&apos;s time and</text><text start="7057.86" dur="7.62">attention and really enjoyed that last</text><text start="7061.159" dur="7.921">uh conversation and Greg if you</text><text start="7065.48" dur="6.0">can get Gilbert and Danielle Allen to</text><text start="7069.08" dur="3.539">have a conversation and that can have</text><text start="7071.48" dur="3.719">enough</text><text start="7072.619" dur="4.761">time uh</text><text start="7075.199" dur="4.92">that would be fantastic that would be a</text><text start="7077.38" dur="5.04">really really worth having happened and</text><text start="7080.119" dur="7.02">being like well produced and distributed</text><text start="7082.42" dur="7.48">uh I will support that if I can</text><text

start="7099.38" dur="6.299">and I think the Stowe has done such a</text><text start="7102.8" dur="4.98">good job of avoiding culture war and but</text><text start="7105.679" dur="4.081">rather than to avoid it here to say how</text><text start="7107.78" dur="3.24">do we lean into where it&apos;s hottest in a</text><text start="7109.76" dur="5.22">way that heals it</text><text start="7111.02"
