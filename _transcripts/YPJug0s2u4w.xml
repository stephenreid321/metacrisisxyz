dur="2.959">very pleased today to be sitting with my</text><text start="9.04" dur="3.04">good friend</text><text start="9.679" dur="4.321">daniel schmochtenberger who is the</text><text start="12.08" dur="3.12">founder of the consilience project</text><text start="14.0" dur="2.48">there&apos;s a lot more that i could say</text><text start="15.2" dur="2.64">about you daniel but i think we will</text><text start="16.48" dur="4.4">leave it at that for now</text><text start="17.84" dur="4.32">people can look up your bio if they want</text><text start="20.88" dur="2.88">to do so</text><text start="22.16" dur="3.6">i should probably start by telling</text><text start="23.76" dur="3.519">people that when i say that you are my</text><text start="25.76" dur="3.519">good friend i really mean that</text><text start="27.279" dur="3.76">you and i are good friends although to</text><text start="29.279" dur="2.8">be honest we haven&apos;t spent all that much</text><text start="31.039" dur="3.36">time together</text><text start="32.079" dur="3.441">this is one of those cases where you</text><text start="34.399" dur="2.801">meet somebody</text><text start="35.52" dur="4.0">somebody who has started from a very</text><text start="37.2" dur="4.16">different place and you discover that</text><text start="39.52" dur="4.32">you have all kinds of thought processes</text><text start="41.36" dur="3.039">that have reached similar conclusions</text><text start="43.84" dur="2.719">and</text><text start="44.399" dur="3.68">uh every discussion is fascinating the</text><text start="46.559" dur="3.201">more i learn about what you think</text><text start="48.079" dur="4.401">the more i realize i&apos;ve got a lot to</text><text start="49.76" dur="4.799">learn from you and that there is</text><text start="52.48" dur="4.48">uh essentially infinite ground to be</text><text start="54.559" dur="3.68">covered so welcome daniel</text><text start="56.96" dur="4.0">thank you brett it&apos;s really good to be</text><text start="58.239" dur="4.721">here i feel the same way that</text><text start="60.96" dur="3.36">um we were introduced by our friend</text><text start="62.96" dur="4.32">jordan hall</text><text start="64.32" dur="3.839">and uh we&apos;ve never had a conversation</text><text start="67.28" dur="2.08">where i</text><text start="68.159" dur="3.441">didn&apos;t learn something and where i</text><text start="69.36" dur="3.759">didn&apos;t appreciate the</text><text start="71.6" dur="3.36">good faith way that you showed up when</text><text start="73.119" dur="3.281">we had a disagreement to talk through</text><text start="74.96" dur="4.72">which is always</text><text start="76.4" dur="4.8">fun it is always fun and and i must say</text><text start="79.68" dur="3.439">i did a little bit of</text><text start="81.2" dur="3.2">poking around seeing recent interviews</text><text start="83.119" dur="3.761">you&apos;d done but i</text><text start="84.4" dur="4.56">deliberately did not overly study for</text><text start="86.88" dur="2.96">this my sense is that the audience will</text><text start="88.96" dur="3.199">get a great deal</text><text start="89.84" dur="3.2">out of uh hearing you and me go back and</text><text start="92.159" dur="2.561">forth and</text><text start="93.04" dur="3.039">finding out what we agree on where we</text><text start="94.72" dur="4.32">disagree and</text><text start="96.079" dur="4.881">maybe most tellingly there&apos;s a</text><text start="99.04" dur="4.8">phenomenon</text><text start="100.96" dur="3.28">in which anybody who has learned to</text><text start="103.84" dur="2.959">think</text><text start="104.24" dur="3.36">more or less independently tends to have</text><text start="106.799" dur="2.721">their own</text><text start="107.6" dur="3.92">language for things their own set of</text><text start="109.52" dur="4.32">examples that they use to explain</text><text start="111.52" dur="3.2">things that recur over and over again</text><text start="113.84" dur="2.48">and so</text><text start="114.72" dur="3.999">in order to have high quality</text><text start="116.32" dur="4.0">conversations uh there is this</text><text start="118.719" dur="3.521">this period in which you&apos;re effectively</text><text start="120.32" dur="4.799">teaching the other person how you</text><text start="122.24" dur="4.159">phrase things and seeing those things</text><text start="125.119" dur="2.721">line up is great</text><text start="126.399" dur="3.121">and in the rare case where they don&apos;t</text><text start="127.84" dur="3.039">line up it&apos;s even better because you</text><text start="129.52" dur="2.719">know there&apos;s something to be learned one</text><text start="130.879" dur="4.481">way or the other</text><text start="132.239" dur="4.241">so i&apos;m hoping that will emerge here i&apos;m</text><text start="135.36" dur="4.8">looking forward to it</text><text start="136.48" dur="5.52">all right good so let&apos;s start here</text><text start="140.16" dur="3.439">when i say that you and i come from</text><text start="142.0" dur="5.04">different starting points</text><text start="143.599" dur="7.761">i i mean to imply something</text><text start="147.04" dur="5.04">in particular you as i understand it</text><text start="151.36" dur="3.12">were</text><text start="152.08" dur="4.48">home schooled and as you have described</text><text start="154.48" dur="4.0">it that was actually closer to what most</text><text start="156.56" dur="5.12">people would probably refer to</text><text start="158.48" dur="5.44">as unschooling somehow this did not</text><text start="161.68" dur="4.48">mess up your motivational structures</text><text start="163.92" dur="3.44">your parents were alert about what they</text><text start="166.16" dur="3.04">were doing and so</text><text start="167.36" dur="3.599">you ended up pursuing what you wanted to</text><text start="169.2" dur="4.319">pursue</text><text start="170.959" dur="3.441">and it did not you did not get in your</text><text start="173.519" dur="4.0">own way</text><text start="174.4" dur="6.16">and lo and behold you end up a</text><text start="177.519" dur="6.64">wickedly smart independent</text><text start="180.56" dur="6.56">first principles thinker</text><text start="184.159" dur="4.241">now that&apos;s not my story at all my story</text><text start="187.12" dur="3.44">is i went to school</text><text start="188.4" dur="3.199">and it didn&apos;t work i had something that</text><text start="190.56" dur="3.44">most people would</text><text start="191.599" dur="3.601">call a learning disability and it got in</text><text start="194.0" dur="4.159">the way of</text><text start="195.2" dur="3.92">school functioning for me and more often</text><text start="198.159" dur="4.16">than not i got</text><text start="199.12" dur="5.52">dumb tracked and basically that complete</text><text start="202.319" dur="4.56">failure of school to reach me</text><text start="204.64" dur="4.159">accidentally worked like some kind of</text><text start="206.879" dur="5.041">unschooling i would say</text><text start="208.799" dur="3.841">and so there are maybe many paths i</text><text start="211.92" dur="3.84">don&apos;t know</text><text start="212.64" dur="4.159">but i&apos;d be curious four people who have</text><text start="215.76" dur="4.88">traveled some</text><text start="216.799" dur="7.121">road to the land of high quality</text><text start="220.64" dur="5.04">independent thought what can they expect</text><text start="223.92" dur="5.28">the experience to be</text><text start="225.68" dur="3.52">like when they arrived there</text><text start="230.319" dur="3.761">the experience of high quality</text><text start="232.159" dur="4.64">independent thought</text><text start="234.08" dur="4.4">yes if you imagine that well it would be</text><text start="236.799" dur="5.041">lovely to think independently</text><text start="238.48" dur="5.119">and to do so well and the world is going</text><text start="241.84" dur="2.88">to be a paradise if you start doing that</text><text start="243.599" dur="3.041">because of course</text><text start="244.72" dur="4.239">that&apos;s a very desirable thing to do and</text><text start="246.64" dur="4.48">people will appreciate it</text><text start="248.959" dur="4.161">you&apos;re going to be surprised that&apos;s not</text><text start="251.12" dur="4.24">necessarily what happens when you arrive</text><text start="253.12" dur="3.76">there and certain experiences show up</text><text start="255.36" dur="3.36">all over the place and without telling</text><text start="256.88" dur="2.879">you what my experiences might have been</text><text start="258.72" dur="2.72">i&apos;m curious</text><text start="259.759" dur="3.281">as to what you might have encountered</text><text start="261.44" dur="2.8">and whether or not those things will be</text><text start="263.04" dur="6.8">similar</text><text start="264.24" dur="5.6">ah yeah it&apos;s an interesting question</text><text start="270.8" dur="6.48">uh i think you will experience</text><text start="274.16" dur="4.479">most people will experience a higher</text><text start="277.28" dur="5.04">degree of uncertainty</text><text start="278.639" dur="5.521">than people that are part of any</text><text start="282.32" dur="4.4">camp that has figured most things out</text><text start="284.16" dur="4.0">and they can cognitively offload whoever</text><text start="286.72" dur="3.36">the authorities or the general group</text><text start="288.16" dur="4.96">consensus is</text><text start="290.08" dur="4.96">um and certainty is</text><text start="293.12" dur="3.44">certainly comfortable in a particular</text><text start="295.04" dur="4.159">way</text><text start="296.56" dur="4.639">and if you&apos;re really thinking well about</text><text start="299.199" dur="3.601">what is my basis for what i believe what</text><text start="301.199" dur="3.601">is the epistemic grounding what&apos;s the</text><text start="302.8" dur="2.959">basis of my confidence margin</text><text start="304.8" dur="4.399">and you really think about your</text><text start="305.759" dur="6.16">confidence basis clearly</text><text start="309.199" dur="3.921">as you try to find more information to</text><text start="311.919" dur="4.641">deepen the topic</text><text start="313.12" dur="5.84">the known unknowns expand faster</text><text start="316.56" dur="3.44">like at least at a second order to what</text><text start="318.96" dur="3.36">the uh</text><text start="320.0" dur="4.24">known knowns do and so you keep being</text><text start="322.32" dur="3.599">aware of more stuff that you don&apos;t know</text><text start="324.24" dur="3.28">that you know is relevant and pertains</text><text start="325.919" dur="4.401">to the situation</text><text start="327.52" dur="3.28">so there&apos;s a complexification of thought</text><text start="330.32" dur="2.56">there&apos;s an</text><text start="330.8" dur="4.32">increase in uncertainty hopefully</text><text start="332.88" dur="3.759">there&apos;s an emotional development</text><text start="335.12" dur="2.96">and kind of a psychological development</text><text start="336.639" dur="2.161">where there&apos;s an increased comfort with</text><text start="338.08" dur="3.44">uncertainty</text><text start="338.8" dur="3.36">so that you can actually be honest and</text><text start="341.52" dur="3.28">not</text><text start="342.16" dur="4.0">uh defect on your own sense making into</text><text start="344.8" dur="3.52">premature certainty that creates</text><text start="346.16" dur="4.72">confirmation bias</text><text start="348.32" dur="3.04">and there&apos;s also a and i think that&apos;s</text><text start="350.88" dur="2.96">why</text><text start="351.36" dur="4.8">one of the reasons used term independent</text><text start="353.84" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="356.72" dur="3.28">there is a certain aloneness of not</text><text start="359.52" dur="2.239">having</text><text start="360.0" dur="4.319">a whole camp of people that think very</text><text start="361.759" dur="2.56">similarly</text><text start="364.84" dur="4.6">um</text><text start="366.639" dur="4.321">i don&apos;t find that to be a painful thing</text><text start="369.44" dur="4.64">right</text><text start="370.96" dur="4.079">but it&apos;s a thing no it&apos;s actually in its</text><text start="374.08" dur="4.16">own way</text><text start="375.039" dur="6.321">uh it&apos;s freeing because</text><text start="378.24" dur="6.32">the fact is if you follow</text><text start="381.36" dur="4.88">logic to natural conclusions</text><text start="384.56" dur="3.52">you&apos;ll end up saying a lot of things</text><text start="386.24" dur="4.88">that uh</text><text start="388.08" dur="4.8">are alarming or discordant with the</text><text start="391.12" dur="4.88">conventional wisdom</text><text start="392.88" dur="4.159">and the world neatly divides into people</text><text start="396.0" dur="4.0">who will be</text><text start="397.039" dur="3.521">so enraged or thrown by what you&apos;re</text><text start="400.0" dur="4.319">saying</text><text start="400.56" dur="5.6">that they uh disappear or</text><text start="404.319" dur="4.0">maybe they become antagonists at a</text><text start="406.16" dur="3.92">distance and the people</text><text start="408.319" dur="3.361">who have a similar experience and</text><text start="410.08" dur="2.959">therefore aren&apos;t thrown by the fact that</text><text start="411.68" dur="3.04">you&apos;re saying things that are out of</text><text start="413.039" dur="5.921">phase and so</text><text start="414.72" dur="6.4">editing the world down to those who are</text><text start="418.96" dur="3.12">comfortable with what they don&apos;t know</text><text start="421.12" dur="3.28">who are interested</text><text start="422.08" dur="3.6">in following things where they lead</text><text start="424.4" dur="5.359">irrespective of</text><text start="425.68" dur="6.72">who that uh elevates and and who it uh</text><text start="429.759" dur="3.84">um hobbles those people are interesting</text><text start="432.4" dur="4.639">people to hang out with</text><text start="433.599" dur="5.681">and so yes the uh the alienation</text><text start="437.039" dur="3.921">may be a blessing in disguise in some</text><text start="439.28" dur="3.199">ways</text><text start="440.96" dur="4.72">there&apos;s two other thoughts that came up</text><text start="442.479" dur="3.201">as you&apos;re just talking one is</text><text start="446.0" dur="3.759">i i wouldn&apos;t call myself an independent</text><text start="448.8" dur="3.04">thinker</text><text start="449.759" dur="3.681">i&apos;m being particular about the semantic</text><text start="451.84" dur="3.199">of the word independent i wouldn&apos;t call</text><text start="453.44" dur="2.64">anyone an independent thinker because i</text><text start="455.039" dur="2.72">think in words</text><text start="456.08" dur="3.28">invented by other people i think in</text><text start="457.759" dur="4.081">concepts invented and discovered by</text><text start="459.36" dur="2.48">other people</text><text start="462.08" dur="4.08">i don&apos;t necessarily have a specific</text><text start="464.879" dur="4.32">school of orthodoxy</text><text start="466.16" dur="6.24">from which i take an entire world view</text><text start="469.199" dur="4.961">but almost every idea that i believe in</text><text start="472.4" dur="4.88">i did not discover</text><text start="474.16" dur="4.8">and so uh</text><text start="477.28" dur="3.759">i think that&apos;s a very important concept</text><text start="478.96" dur="3.6">because i think the</text><text start="481.039" dur="3.041">the ideas we&apos;re going to discuss today</text><text start="482.56" dur="3.84">regarding democracy</text><text start="484.08" dur="4.0">and open society have to do with the</text><text start="486.4" dur="2.96">relationship between an individual and a</text><text start="488.08" dur="4.399">collective</text><text start="489.36" dur="4.399">and i think the i there</text><text start="492.479" dur="3.041">the idea of an individual is</text><text start="493.759" dur="4.321">fundamentally a misnomer without</text><text start="495.52" dur="4.16">everybody else i wouldn&apos;t be who i am</text><text start="498.08" dur="3.04">and i wouldn&apos;t think the way i think i</text><text start="499.68" dur="3.6">wouldn&apos;t think in the language i do i</text><text start="501.12" dur="4.079">wouldn&apos;t have access to</text><text start="503.28" dur="3.28">you know the knowledge that came from</text><text start="505.199" dur="3.041">the hubble telescope and the large</text><text start="506.56" dur="2.56">hadron collider and so many things like</text><text start="508.24" dur="4.96">that</text><text start="509.12" dur="7.599">um so i can say that there is a certain</text><text start="513.2" dur="5.519">like ultimate authority that of what i</text><text start="516.719" dur="4.081">choose to feel that i believe in and</text><text start="518.719" dur="3.68">trust that has an internal locus of</text><text start="520.8" dur="4.24">control</text><text start="522.399" dur="3.361">but the information coming from without</text><text start="525.04" dur="3.52">in my own</text><text start="525.76" dur="3.6">internal processing of it are part of</text><text start="528.56" dur="4.24">the same</text><text start="529.36" dur="4.88">system so this is a perfect example of</text><text start="532.8" dur="4.08">what i was suggesting</text><text start="534.24" dur="4.96">up front where two people who do</text><text start="536.88" dur="4.48">whatever we&apos;re going to call this</text><text start="539.2" dur="3.44">will will have their own separate</text><text start="541.36" dur="2.96">glossaries</text><text start="542.64" dur="4.16">so if i can translate what you&apos;ve just</text><text start="544.32" dur="4.56">said i daniel schmucktenberger</text><text start="546.8" dur="4.24">am not an independent thinker because</text><text start="548.88" dur="2.959">such a thing is inconceivable in human</text><text start="551.04" dur="3.12">form</text><text start="551.839" dur="3.841">right and i totally agree with that the</text><text start="554.16" dur="4.72">fact is not only</text><text start="555.68" dur="5.68">are you interwoven with all</text><text start="558.88" dur="4.24">sorts of humans who are responsible for</text><text start="561.36" dur="4.32">conveying to you in one way or another</text><text start="563.12" dur="3.839">conclusions that you couldn&apos;t possibly</text><text start="565.68" dur="2.24">check you know these are thoughts that</text><text start="566.959" dur="4.32">would be familiar</text><text start="567.92" dur="6.479">to descartes for example um</text><text start="571.279" dur="4.161">but you are also building from the</text><text start="574.399" dur="4.081">entirety</text><text start="575.44" dur="4.8">of cumulative human culture</text><text start="578.48" dur="3.12">right all of the tools with which you</text><text start="580.24" dur="3.92">can think</text><text start="581.6" dur="3.76">are uh almost all of them are too</text><text start="584.16" dur="4.32">ancient to even know</text><text start="585.36" dur="5.039">where their rudiments originated so</text><text start="588.48" dur="3.76">anyway i don&apos;t disagree with any of that</text><text start="590.399" dur="3.44">so to me i would say there is such a</text><text start="592.24" dur="3.84">thing as an independent thinker</text><text start="593.839" dur="4.321">and in your schema it has to do with</text><text start="596.08" dur="4.24">whether or not they are thinking a la</text><text start="598.16" dur="5.04">carte that is to say</text><text start="600.32" dur="4.639">using that set of

that</text><text start="854.56" dur="4.48">on the one hand it is you could take</text><text start="857.839" dur="3.68">from it a kind of</text><text start="859.04" dur="4.56">reason for despair

more tractable than many people</text><text start="905.44" dur="2.56">think it is</text><text start="909.76" dur="3.759">yeah i mean you mentioned hopefulness</text><text start="912.32" dur="2.079">you mentioned a bunch of good things</text><text start="913.519" dur="2.56">there</text><text start="914.399" dur="3.281">that rather than a bunch of separate</text><text start="916.079" dur="4.801">problems you have</text><text start="917.68" dur="7.2">a few problems with lots of expressions</text><text start="920.88" dur="7.28">this was a big chunk of the kind of work</text><text start="924.88" dur="7.84">i engaged in and with a number of people</text><text start="928.16" dur="6.239">uh you were part of uh looking at</text><text start="932.72" dur="3.84">when we inventory across all of the</text><text start="934.399" dur="4.161">catastrophic and existential risks ones</text><text start="936.56" dur="4.56">involving</text><text start="938.56" dur="4.0">ai and problems

dur="3.76">that escalate to large-scale war</text><text start="946.88" dur="2.56">is there anything in terms of the</text><text start="948.0" dur="2.24">patterns of human behavior that they</text><text start="949.44" dur="3.6">have in common</text><text start="950.24" dur="3.839">and so this kind of race to the bottom</text><text start="953.04" dur="4.08">collective coordination</text><text start="954.079" dur="4.401">thing is one way of looking at that but</text><text start="957.12" dur="2.48">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a few ways of looking</text><text start="958.48" dur="3.039">at what we&apos;d call the generator</text><text start="959.6" dur="4.4">functions of catastrophic risk</text><text start="961.519" dur="4.721">and it really is simplifying if you can</text><text start="964.0" dur="5.12">say are there categorical solutions</text><text start="966.24" dur="4.0">to those underlying generator functions</text><text start="969.12" dur="3.92">they&apos;re hard</text><text start="970.24" dur="5.12">right they&apos;re they&apos;re hard um now when</text><text start="973.04" dur="5.84">you talk about hopefulness</text><text start="975.36" dur="5.44">uh i notice that the way that i relate</text><text start="978.88" dur="3.759">to the optimism pessimism thing is</text><text start="980.8" dur="5.68">there&apos;s an optimism</text><text start="982.639" dur="6.401">which is almost like a choice to say</text><text start="986.48" dur="4.4">i&apos;m going to have optimism that&apos;s that</text><text start="989.04" dur="3.359">there is a solution space worth</text><text start="990.88" dur="2.319">investigating even if i don&apos;t know what</text><text start="992.399" dur="2.481">it is</text><text start="993.199" dur="3.121">and if i&apos;m wrong that&apos;s it&apos;s the right</text><text start="994.88" dur="2.879">side to be wrong on</text><text start="996.32" dur="4.079">as opposed to there was a solution i</text><text start="997.759" dur="4.32">didn&apos;t look for it um</text><text start="1000.399" dur="3.201">and then i&apos;m going to have pessimism</text><text start="1002.079" dur="3.12">about my own solution so i&apos;m going to</text><text start="1003.6" dur="2.88">try to red team my solution so that i</text><text start="1005.199" dur="2.08">can find out how they&apos;re going to fail</text><text start="1006.48" dur="2.24">before</text><text start="1007.279" dur="3.201">finding out how they fail the hard way</text><text start="1008.72" dur="4.479">in the world but then</text><text start="1010.48" dur="4.32">not be devastated by the fact and that</text><text start="1013.199" dur="3.281">might that solution wasn&apos;t it and keep</text><text start="1014.8" dur="2.479">trying and i think that&apos;s kind of how</text><text start="1016.48" dur="3.44">the</text><text start="1017.279" dur="4.401">um committedly inventive innovative</text><text start="1019.92" dur="4.159">principle works</text><text start="1021.68" dur="4.08">so uh yeah again we&apos;ve we could uh do</text><text start="1024.079" dur="3.041">almost a one-to-one mapping of your</text><text start="1025.76" dur="4.0">schema onto mine</text><text start="1027.12" dur="3.04">i do this in terms of prototyping rather</text><text start="1029.76" dur="3.039">than</text><text start="1030.16" dur="4.399">red teaming and discovering it&apos;s wrong</text><text start="1032.799" dur="4.24">it amounts to the same thing</text><text start="1034.559" dur="3.76">when you say actually it&apos;s hard you and</text><text start="1037.039" dur="4.081">i would have to define</text><text start="1038.319" dur="3.921">two different kinds of hard probably</text><text start="1041.12" dur="5.199">there is</text><text start="1042.24" dur="5.76">hard to make function to stabilize</text><text start="1046.319" dur="3.281">and there&apos;s hard to figure out what the</text><text start="1048.0" dur="4.08">solution is</text><text start="1049.6" dur="4.24">and those are distinct we might find</text><text start="1052.08" dur="5.28">elements of both of them here but</text><text start="1053.84" dur="6.4">let me just give a maybe it&apos;s um</text><text start="1057.36" dur="4.64">the canonical example of a solution to a</text><text start="1060.24" dur="5.2">game theory problem</text><text start="1062.0" dur="6.559">that uh everyone will recognize</text><text start="1065.44" dur="6.16">i divide you choose right it&apos;s</text><text start="1068.559" dur="3.841">the perfect solution to an obvious</text><text start="1071.6" dur="4.16">problem</text><text start="1072.4" dur="6.56">of choice and selfishness right</text><text start="1075.76" dur="5.44">if there is cake and</text><text start="1078.96" dur="4.24">i know that you&apos;re going to get your</text><text start="1081.2" dur="3.599">choice and that you are incentivized to</text><text start="1083.2" dur="3.68">pick the larger piece then i am</text><text start="1084.799" dur="2.961">incentivized to get the cut as even as</text><text start="1086.88" dur="3.36">possible</text><text start="1087.76" dur="4.32">and the point is it neutralizes the</text><text start="1090.24" dur="4.559">concern</text><text start="1092.08" dur="3.76">so we are looking for solutions of that</text><text start="1094.799" dur="4.081">nature</text><text start="1095.84" dur="6.16">now i don&apos;t think they are</text><text start="1098.88" dur="4.799">all that hard to

the</text><text start="1114.32" dur="3.84">there is it is very rare for people to</text><text start="1117.12" dur="4.32">understand</text><text start="1118.16" dur="6.639">how much danger we&apos;re

dur="3.68">in the present and people get fed and</text><text start="1136.32" dur="3.52">housed</text><text start="1137.12" dur="4.96">it is very easy for them to ignore the</text><text start="1139.84"

all the previous</text><text start="1195.679" dur="4.641">civilizations that failed</text><text start="1198.16" dur="3.36">had so much hubris before their fall</text><text start="1200.32"

where i</text><text start="1505.2" dur="3.839">first started having you know coherent</text><text start="1507.679" dur="3.841">thoughts about</text><text start="1509.039" dur="3.361">the world that

start="3157.599" dur="4.081">i appreciate you doing that um i did</text><text start="3159.52" dur="2.72">want to go back to a couple things you</text><text start="3161.68" dur="1.84">said and</text><text start="3162.24" dur="3.359">you know of course this happens every</text><text start="3163.52" dur="5.28">time you and i talk where every</text><text start="3165.599" dur="4.801">every

dur="3.52">our wiring which is biased in the</text><text start="3186.24" dur="3.2">direction of</text><text start="3187.2" dur="5.6">those places where our ancestors had</text><text start="3189.44" dur="3.36">agency that was meaningful</text><text start="3193.44" dur="3.119">up upends us and in fact this is</text><text start="3194.88" dur="4.32">something i think you and i are</text><text

start="3210.96" dur="5.92">and so in any case</text><text start="3214.16" dur="3.52">within your population survival and</text><text start="3216.88" dur="4.08">mating</text><text start="3217.68" dur="3.84">makes sense as an obsession but probably</text><text start="3220.96" dur="3.76">the biggest</text><text start="3221.52" dur="5.44">factor in whether or not your genes are</text><text

dur="5.919">um the point i&apos;m so happy to hear you</text><text start="3271.52" dur="5.599">saying this because</text><text start="3274.079" dur="4.641">uh i&apos;m sure this is a conversation i</text><text start="3277.119" dur="4.881">would love to go deeper and understand</text><text start="3278.72" dur="4.48">the the distinctions between lineage and</text><text start="3282.0" dur="2.319">group selection the way that you see</text><text start="3283.2" dur="3.2">them</text><text start="3284.319" dur="3.441">but if i just even take the concept of</text><text start="3286.4" dur="2.8">group selection as opposed to just</text><text start="3287.76" dur="4.4">individual selection and</text><text start="3289.2" dur="4.879">take a species like sapiens and say</text><text

dur="3.44">so there was a fundamentally kind of</text><text start="3303.76" dur="5.52">pro-social behavior that were</text><text start="3305.44" dur="6.8">requisite um but then</text><text

somebody yelling</text><text start="3638.48" dur="3.359">from his thing</text><text start="3639.599" dur="3.361">so there&apos;s a symmetry between the supply</text><text start="3641.839"

start="3648.4" dur="3.199">side is a person or a family trying to</text><text start="3650.0" dur="2.64">buy something and they can kind of tell</text><text start="3651.599" dur="2.96">each

manufactured</text><text start="3699.04" dur="4.88">demand</text><text start="3700.559" dur="4.081">kills market theory and classical market</text><text start="3703.92" dur="4.0">theory</text><text

start="3711.599" dur="4.081">evolutionary process is that the demand</text><text start="3714.88" dur="2.88">is based on</text><text start="3715.68" dur="3.439">real people wanting things that

evolutionary</text><text start="3722.079" dur="3.921">niche for people to provide supply</text><text start="3723.92" dur="3.04">and then the rational actor will</text><text start="3726.0" dur="3.039">purchase</text><text start="3726.96" dur="3.44">the good or service at the best price</text><text start="3729.039" dur="3.52">and of the best value</text><text start="3730.4"

then a few people in just the market</text><text start="4008.72" dur="4.48">dynamic would be able to have way</text><text start="4011.44" dur="4.48">outsized control over everyone else</text><text

start="4192.64" dur="4.24">and so then you end up getting a crony</text><text start="4194.88" dur="3.52">capitalist structure which is worse than</text><text start="4196.88" dur="3.279">just an evil market</text><text start="4198.4" dur="3.759">because now it has the regulatory</text><text start="4200.159" dur="3.281">apparatus of rule of law and monopoly of</text><text start="4202.159" dur="4.321">violence backing up</text><text start="4203.44" dur="5.04">the market type the dynamics</text><text start="4206.48" dur="3.12">so then we say okay well what do we do</text><text start="4208.48" dur="3.28">here</text><text start="4209.6" dur="4.0">and we see that civilizations fail</text><text start="4211.76" dur="3.6">towards either oppression or chaos</text><text

which we</text><text start="4245.679" dur="4.0">can see is happening in the west and in</text><text start="4247.6" dur="4.559">the us in particular right now</text><text start="4249.679" dur="4.161">and then china which is happy to do the</text><text start="4252.159" dur="3.121">oppression thing and oppression beats</text><text start="4253.84" dur="4.0">chaos and war</text><text start="4255.28" dur="4.32">right because it has more ability to</text><text start="4257.84" dur="3.52">execute effectively which is why</text><text start="4259.6" dur="3.2">china has built high-speed

dur="2.48">modes</text><text start="4275.12" dur="3.2">what is the what is there other than</text><text start="4276.88" dur="4.72">oppression or</text><text start="4278.32" dur="5.68">um or chaos is</text><text start="4281.6" dur="4.24">order that is emergent not imposed which</text><text start="4284.0" dur="3.52">requires a culture of people who can all</text><text start="4285.84"

differently and are</text><text start="4299.52" dur="6.0">anonymous to each other not a tribe</text><text start="4302.08" dur="7.28">that was an enlightenment era idea right</text><text start="4305.52" dur="5.28">born out of the idea that we could all</text><text start="4309.36" dur="3.12">make sense of the world together born</text><text start="4310.8" dur="3.439">out of the philosophy of science and the</text><text start="4312.48" dur="2.719">hegelian dialectic that we could make</text><text start="4314.239" dur="3.041">sense of</text><text start="4315.199" dur="3.681">base reality and that we could make</text><text start="4317.28" dur="4.56">sense of each other&apos;s perspective</text><text start="4318.88" dur="4.4">dialectic find a synthesis and then be</text><text start="4321.84" dur="2.399">able to have that be the basis of</text><text start="4323.28" dur="4.0">governance</text><text start="4324.239" dur="4.721">so what what i think is this is not an</text><text start="4327.28" dur="3.2">adequate long-term structure because we</text><text start="4328.96" dur="3.199">can talk about why tech has made</text><text start="4330.48" dur="3.36">nation-state democracies</text><text start="4332.159" dur="4.321">obsolete and it&apos;s just not obvious yet</text><text start="4333.84" dur="5.2">but it has but as an intermediate</text><text start="4336.48" dur="4.719">structure the reboot of the thing that</text><text start="4339.04" dur="4.0">was intended has to start at the level</text><text start="4341.199" dur="3.52">of the people at culture</text><text start="4343.04" dur="3.52">and that collective sense making and</text><text start="4344.719" dur="3.361">collective good faith dialogue</text><text start="4346.56" dur="3.52">because without that you can&apos;t find</text><text start="4348.08" dur="3.92">state without that you can&apos;t find market</text><text start="4350.08" dur="4.639">incentive</text><text start="4352.0" dur="4.0">okay i love this riff of yours okay i</text><text start="4354.719" dur="3.44">think there&apos;s a tremendous</text><text start="4356.0"

of</text><text start="4362.0" dur="3.36">trouble following it but i</text><text start="4363.76" dur="3.439">i actually would advise them to maybe to</text><text start="4365.36" dur="2.72">go back through it and listen to it</text><text start="4367.199" dur="2.241">again because it&apos;s</text><text start="4368.08" dur="3.76">right on the money as far as i&apos;m</text><text start="4369.44" dur="4.4">concerned there&apos;s one place where i</text><text start="4371.84" dur="4.96">wonder if it doesn&apos;t have two things</text><text start="4373.84" dur="4.96">inverted so you talk about the two</text><text start="4376.8" dur="4.72">characteristics that are necessary</text><text start="4378.8" dur="5.359">in order for uh what did you call it</text><text start="4381.52" dur="4.56">liberal democracy or</text><text start="4384.159" dur="4.0">whatever it was that you used as a</text><text start="4386.08" dur="4.48">moniker to function</text><text start="4388.159" dur="4.721">one of them had to do with the idea that</text><text start="4390.56" dur="2.8">the state was big enough to bind the</text><text start="4392.88" dur="3.6">most</text><text start="4393.36" dur="5.68">powerful and well-resourced actors</text><text start="4396.48" dur="5.84">and the second was that the people have</text><text start="4399.04" dur="5.36">to be capable of binding the state</text><text start="4402.32" dur="3.52">now i understood you to say that what</text><text start="4404.4" dur="3.44">failed first</text><text start="4405.84" dur="5.0">was the people&apos;s ability to bind the</text><text start="4407.84" dur="4.319">state is that</text><text start="4410.84" dur="3.319">correct</text><text start="4412.159" dur="3.761">i&apos;m saying that&apos;s at the

i see it what happened was</text><text start="4422.96" dur="5.199">the power the fact that there is always</text><text start="4426.159" dur="3.441">corruption</text><text start="4428.159" dur="4.641">it&apos;s impossible to drive it out</text><text start="4429.6" dur="4.48">completely the corruption self enlarges</text><text start="4432.8" dur="3.2">the loopholes</text><text start="4434.08" dur="3.92">and becomes subtle enough that it&apos;s hard</text><text start="4436.0" dur="4.8">to see directly</text><text start="4438.0" dur="3.84">the most powerful actors suddenly got an</text><text start="4440.8" dur="3.359">infusion</text><text start="4441.84" dur="4.319">of power and we could trace down the</text><text start="4444.159" dur="2.56">cause of it but let&apos;s just say somewhere</text><text start="4446.159" dur="3.841">in</text><text start="4446.719" dur="6.641">recent history the most powerful actors</text><text start="4450.0" dur="5.12">became more powerful than the state and</text><text start="4453.36" dur="4.799">what they did with that power</text><text start="4455.12" dur="4.96">was they unhooked the ability of the</text><text start="4458.159" dur="4.401">state to regulate the market</text><text start="4460.08" dur="3.28">i believe the reason for this was that</text><text start="4462.56" dur="3.52">each</text><text start="4463.36" dur="2.72">individual</text><text start="4466.56" dur="5.44">industry had an interest in having its</text><text start="4469.36" dur="4.56">regulations removed in order to create a</text><text start="4472.0" dur="4.64">bigger slice of the pie for it</text><text start="4473.92" dur="4.88">and so effectively what you had was each</text><text start="4476.64" dur="3.039">industry

dur="4.161">then we&apos;ll partner and see what you got</text><text start="4499.52" dur="4.48">was many industries partnering to unhook</text><text start="4501.84" dur="4.879">the ability of the

dur="2.721">work</text><text start="4508.88" dur="3.76">was they had to eliminate the ability of</text><text start="4510.96" dur="3.199">the people to veto</text><text start="4512.64" dur="3.76">right

dur="5.2">gets larger and so uh manufactured</text><text start="4567.52" dur="3.44">demand becomes a more intense thing well</text><text start="4569.28" dur="5.439">the same thing is true</text><text start="4570.96" dur="5.36">in terms of the market capacity to</text><text start="4574.719" dur="3.52">influence the government and the market</text><text start="4576.32" dur="4.56">government

country that</text><text start="4670.4" dur="5.839">uh voting is the death of democracy</text><text start="4673.04" dur="4.56">because the idea is we should just be</text><text start="4676.239" dur="2.48">able to have a conversation that is good</text><text start="4677.6" dur="2.72">enough that we come up with a solution</text><text start="4678.719" dur="3.681">and everyone&apos;s like that&apos;s a good idea</text><text start="4680.32" dur="3.2">if we can&apos;t then we vote but that means</text><text start="4682.4" dur="2.64">that some</text><text start="4683.52" dur="3.12">big

dur="3.759">answer and you&apos;re going to know why by</text><text start="4778.96" dur="4.56">the time we decide to do it</text><text start="4781.199" dur="4.48">wait there&apos;s a cemetery here between the</text><text start="4783.52" dur="5.04">conversation that we had about</text><text start="4785.679" dur="4.401">the market in sending people who focus</text><text start="4788.56" dur="3.04">on the opportunity and not the risk</text><text start="4790.08" dur="3.44">such that it actually suppresses those</text><text start="4791.6" dur="3.92">who look at the risk</text><text

start="4810.239" dur="4.241">right and so i don&apos;t ever even try to</text><text start="4813.36" dur="3.12">say what is it that</text><text start="4814.48" dur="3.44">everyone cares about relative to this so</text><text start="4816.48" dur="3.44">i even know what a good solution would</text><text start="4817.92" dur="3.84">look like to craft a proposal no</text><text start="4819.92" dur="3.759">we&apos;re going to vote on the proposition</text><text start="4821.76" dur="4.399">having never done any sense making about</text><text start="4823.679" dur="6.721">what a good proposition would be</text><text start="4826.159" dur="6.0">and that&apos;s just mind-blowingly stupid</text><text start="4830.4" dur="3.44">right and so then who&apos;s going to craft</text><text start="4832.159" dur="3.761">the proposition a lawyer lawyer is paid</text><text start="4833.84" dur="5.52">for by who some special interest group</text><text start="4835.92" dur="6.88">and so now so</text><text start="4839.36" dur="6.64">most of the time what happens is</text><text start="4842.8" dur="5.359">you have some situation where one thing</text><text start="4846.0" dur="4.159">that matters to some people has this</text><text start="4848.159" dur="3.361">proposition put forward that benefits it</text><text start="4850.159" dur="3.201">simply in the short term but it</text><text start="4851.52" dur="2.88">externalizes a harm to something that</text><text start="4853.36" dur="2.799">matters to other people</text><text start="4854.4" dur="4.08">but ultimately all of it matters to</text><text start="4856.159" dur="4.56">everybody just differentially weighted</text><text start="4858.48" dur="3.199">and the how do we put all those things</text><text start="4860.719" dur="2.321">together so</text><text start="4861.679" dur="2.801">okay we&apos;re going to do something that&apos;s</text><text start="4863.04" dur="2.24">going to benefit the economy but harm</text><text start="4864.48" dur="2.8">the environment</text><text start="4865.28" dur="3.04">well everybody cares about the economy</text><text start="4867.28" dur="2.0">and everybody cares about the</text><text start="4868.32" dur="2.56">environment</text><text start="4869.28" dur="3.919">but if i put forward a proposition that</text><text start="4870.88" dur="3.759">says in order to solve

dur="2.881">of people who</text><text start="4884.159" dur="3.361">because they hate the solution space</text><text start="4886.08" dur="2.0">because it harm something else they care</text><text

that other</text><text start="4894.0" dur="3.679">risk so much as well but if i said okay</text><text start="4896.48" dur="3.199">well let&apos;s look at</text><text start="4897.679" dur="3.441">it&apos;s a negotiation tactic is what you&apos;re</text><text start="4899.679" dur="5.121">saying that at the point</text><text start="4901.12" dur="6.8">that you want x prioritized over y</text><text start="4904.8" dur="4.399">you&apos;ll potentially you&apos;ll descend into a</text><text start="4907.92" dur="2.96">state in which you&apos;ll make</text><text start="4909.199" dur="5.44">any argument that results in that</text><text start="4910.88" dur="7.68">happening including why doesn&apos;t exist</text><text start="4914.639" dur="4.721">exactly because i&apos;m so motivated by this</text><text start="4918.56" dur="5.04">other thing</text><text start="4919.36" dur="6.319">and the solution has a has a</text><text start="4923.6" dur="3.92">theory of trade-offs built in that is</text><text start="4925.679" dur="3.601">not necessary sometimes the theory of</text><text start="4927.52" dur="3.679">trade-off is necessary but oftentimes</text><text start="4929.28" dur="3.52">a synergistic satisfier could be found</text><text start="4931.199" dur="4.161">but we didn&apos;t try</text><text start="4932.8" dur="4.16">in the same way that a way to move</text><text start="4935.36" dur="2.799">forward with the opportunity without the</text><text start="4936.96" dur="2.719">risk could have happened we could have</text><text start="4938.159" dur="3.201">found a better way to do the tech that</text><text start="4939.679" dur="4.881">internalized that externality</text><text start="4941.36" dur="4.72">we just need to try a little bit more</text><text start="4944.56" dur="3.119">but there isn&apos;t the incentive to do it</text><text start="4946.08" dur="4.24">so let&apos;s say we said</text><text start="4947.679" dur="4.081">no we don&apos;t care about climate change by</text><text start="4950.32" dur="3.359">itself</text><text start="4951.76" dur="3.68">we care about the climate and we care</text><text start="4953.679"

start="4958.8" dur="2.72">and we&apos;re going to look at the adjacent</text><text start="4960.239" dur="1.841">things we&apos;re making a choice in one of</text><text start="4961.52" dur="3.04">the

start="4969.6" dur="3.44">then we could start to think about a</text><text start="4971.44" dur="3.12">proposition intelligently</text><text start="4973.04" dur="3.92">we don&apos;t do this in medicine either we</text><text start="4974.56" dur="4.48">make a medicine to solve</text><text start="4976.96" dur="3.759">a very narrow definition of one</text><text start="4979.04" dur="3.599">molecular

you can&apos;t separate the problems</text><text start="4996.239" dur="1.92">that way</text><text start="4996.8" dur="5.439">you have to think about the whole</text><text start="4998.159" dur="6.641">complex thing better and so</text><text start="5002.239" dur="4.0">so the first part of fixing one part of</text><text start="5004.8" dur="2.16">fixing democracy that we have to think</text><text start="5006.239" dur="2.881">about</text><text start="5006.96" dur="3.759">is we have to define the problem spaces</text><text start="5009.12" dur="3.36">better more

you don&apos;t</text><text start="5095.84" dur="3.28">see a trade-off</text><text start="5097.199" dur="3.601">because you have two characteristics</text><text start="5099.12" dur="3.68">both of which

start="5142.56" dur="2.88">reasons you wouldn&apos;t see it</text><text start="5143.92" dur="3.44">but that if you push these things far</text><text start="5145.44" dur="3.92">enough you&apos;ll find

dur="3.119">that will not exhibit a trade-off</text><text start="5152.08" dur="3.76">relationship</text><text start="5153.679" dur="2.161">right</text><text start="5157.04" dur="4.0">uh initially i don&apos;t agree with that at</text><text start="5159.52" dur="3.199">all but i&apos;m sure you&apos;ve thought about it</text><text start="5161.04" dur="3.28">a lot so i&apos;m curious why you say it</text><text start="5162.719" dur="3.44">well let me give you let me give you the</text><text start="5164.32" dur="4.879">example i used to</text><text start="5166.159" dur="6.321">battle my friend scott pakur</text><text start="5169.199" dur="4.881">uh over with this which is he said why</text><text start="5172.48" dur="4.719">can&apos;t you make a car</text><text start="5174.08" dur="5.44">that&apos;s the fastest and the bluest</text><text start="5177.199" dur="4.321">right and it you know the first time i</text><text start="5179.52" dur="3.84">heard that i was like well</text><text start="5181.52" dur="3.6">okay maybe blue is trivial enough but</text><text start="5183.36" dur="3.839">it&apos;s not in fact</text><text start="5185.12" dur="4.24">if you wanted to make a car that was the</text><text start="5187.199" dur="4.881">fastest and by fastest let&apos;s say</text><text start="5189.36" dur="3.6">fastest accelerating well you&apos;re going</text><text start="5192.08" dur="3.76">to have to decide</text><text start="5192.96" dur="4.56">how to paint it if you also decide that</text><text start="5195.84" dur="3.44">there&apos;s some color of blue that is</text><text start="5197.52" dur="3.44">bluest and you want the car to be that</text><text start="5199.28" dur="2.959">color well then it has done a lot of the</text><text start="5200.96" dur="2.64">choosing of what paint you&apos;re going to</text><text start="5202.239" dur="2.96">put on it</text><text start="5203.6" dur="4.48">at the point you decide to paint it that</text><text start="5205.199" dur="3.52">color that paint will have components</text><text start="5208.08" dur="3.44">that will weigh</text><text start="5208.719" dur="4.801">something right the chances that the</text><text start="5211.52" dur="3.92">bluest whatever you define that to be</text><text start="5213.52" dur="3.44">is also the lightest and has the best</text><text start="5215.44" dur="2.799">laminar flow characteristics are</text><text start="5216.96" dur="2.32">essentially zero</text><text start="5218.239" dur="3.041">right because they&apos;re an infinite</text><text start="5219.28" dur="3.919">diversity of colors they will be made</text><text start="5221.28" dur="4.16">out of a wide variety of materials</text><text start="5223.199" dur="4.081">and the chances that the blue just</text><text start="5225.44" dur="2.64">happens to be the one that is lightest</text><text start="5227.28" dur="2.399">and has the best</text><text start="5228.08" dur="3.52">you know slipperiness relative to the</text><text start="5229.679" dur="4.641">wind are going to be</text><text start="5231.6" dur="3.52">vanishingly small and that means that if</text><text start="5234.32" dur="3.52">you want to make</text><text start="5235.12" dur="4.559">truly the fastest car it&apos;s its color</text><text start="5237.84" dur="3.2">will be chosen by whatever paint has the</text><text start="5239.679" dur="2.96">best characteristics</text><text start="5241.04" dur="4.4">and if you want to make it the bluest as</text><text start="5242.639" dur="5.841">well you&apos;ll make some tiny compromise</text><text start="5245.44" dur="4.64">that uh will you know probably not</text><text start="5248.48" dur="3.28">matter to you but it&apos;s there so the</text><text start="5250.08" dur="1.92">trade-off is there even if we don&apos;t see</text><text start="5251.76" dur="4.16">it</text><text start="5252.0" dur="5.84">but here&apos;s the thing daniel i discovered</text><text start="5255.92" dur="4.64">many years after my argument with scott</text><text start="5257.84" dur="4.64">was long since put to bed</text><text start="5260.56" dur="4.0">that i was right about this and the way</text><text start="5262.48" dur="4.8">i found out was that there is a</text><text start="5264.56" dur="3.84">a case where the navy wanted to set the</text><text start="5267.28" dur="4.0">time to climb</text><text start="5268.4" dur="4.08">record for an aircraft and they took an</text><text start="5271.28" dur="3.12">f-15 and they</text><text start="5272.48" dur="4.32">souped it up a little bit and in order</text><text start="5274.4" dur="3.52">to set the basically the vertical climb</text><text start="5276.8" dur="3.12">rate of this aircraft</text><text start="5277.92" dur="3.84">they stripped the paint off it and so if</text><text start="5279.92" dur="5.12">you look at pictures of this aircraft</text><text start="5281.76" dur="3.84">uh in its you know uh it&apos;s record</text><text start="5285.04" dur="3.52">setting</text><text start="5285.6" dur="4.16">run it isn&apos;t any particular color it&apos;s</text><text start="5288.56" dur="2.72">many different colors because</text><text start="5289.76" dur="2.32">effectively you&apos;ve got the bare metal</text><text start="5291.28" dur="2.399">underneath</text><text start="5292.08" dur="3.28">with the paint stripped off it to save</text><text start="5293.679" dur="2.241">however many pounds of paint they were</text><text start="5295.36" dur="4.64">able to</text><text start="5295.92" dur="4.56">remove okay there are three points that</text><text start="5300.0" dur="3.679">come up</text><text start="5300.48" dur="7.04">to um</text><text start="5303.679" dur="6.801">address my initial thoughts on this here</text><text start="5307.52" dur="2.96">so one is</text><text start="5310.719" dur="6.96">with this particular case of a car</text><text start="5314.08" dur="5.76">the difference between the</text><text start="5317.679" dur="4.081">blue and the optimal color might be at</text><text start="5319.84" dur="5.6">the boundary of measurement</text><text start="5321.76" dur="4.16">itself yep and so while it&apos;s true that</text><text start="5325.44" dur="2.56">there</text><text start="5325.92" dur="3.68">it might not be a perfect optimum of</text><text start="5328.0" dur="5.28">both at the level of</text><text start="5329.6" dur="6.72">like a a nano scale optimization</text><text start="5333.28" dur="4.56">it is irrelevant to the scale of choice</text><text start="5336.32" dur="4.8">making for the most part</text><text start="5337.84" dur="6.16">and when we look at something like 100</text><text start="5341.12" dur="3.92">and when we look at something like tesla</text><text start="5344.0" dur="3.6">cars</text><text start="5345.04" dur="5.119">they became faster off the line than</text><text start="5347.6" dur="4.96">ferraris and safer than volvo&apos;s and</text><text start="5350.159" dur="5.52">greener than prius&apos;s at the same time</text><text start="5352.56" dur="4.56">you could see that ground up design</text><text start="5355.679" dur="3.52">just doing a better job of ground up</text><text start="5357.12" dur="3.92">design was able to optimize for many</text><text start="5359.199" dur="4.641">things simultaneously so</text><text start="5361.04" dur="4.56">much better now had they made it less</text><text start="5363.84" dur="4.48">comfortable could it be faster still</text><text start="5365.6" dur="4.559">sure of course um so it&apos;s optimizing for</text><text start="5368.32" dur="3.68">a product of a bunch of things together</text><text start="5370.159" dur="2.161">but still in a whole different league</text><text start="5372.0" dur="4.32">than</text><text start="5372.32" dur="6.56">things had been previously now</text><text start="5376.32" dur="4.24">first of all this this is beautiful okay</text><text start="5378.88" dur="2.48">because this is exactly what i was</text><text start="5380.56" dur="3.36">hoping for</text><text start="5381.36" dur="4.08">okay um this is a question of us</text><text start="5383.92" dur="4.4">tripping over each other&apos;s</text><text start="5385.44" dur="3.6">language jim misunderstood what you were</text><text start="5388.32" dur="2.64">saying</text><text start="5389.04" dur="3.36">right and he asked me about it and i</text><text start="5390.96" dur="3.12">said uh</text><text start="5392.4" dur="2.96">yeah daniel can&apos;t be right about that if</text><text start="5394.08" dur="2.48">he&apos;s saying what you think he&apos;s saying</text><text start="5395.36" dur="3.04">but of course it wouldn&apos;t make sense</text><text start="5396.56" dur="4.32">that you would think that you could so</text><text start="5398.4" dur="3.92">your point about this being trivial</text><text start="5400.88" dur="2.08">you&apos;re in complete agreement with me and</text><text start="5402.32" dur="2.96">i suspect</text><text start="5402.96" dur="4.4">it would take nothing to get jim to</text><text start="5405.28" dur="4.16">agree to that formulation</text><text start="5407.36" dur="3.279">as well wait there&apos;s a difference</text><text start="5409.44" dur="1.6">there&apos;s one more thing i have to say</text><text start="5410.639" dur="4.08">here</text><text start="5411.04" dur="5.679">okay of course i&apos;m not pretending that</text><text start="5414.719" dur="4.881">thermodynamics don&apos;t exist</text><text start="5416.719" dur="4.721">right and once you get down to the the</text><text start="5419.6" dur="3.44">quantum scale arrangement of the thing</text><text start="5421.44" dur="2.799">that orientation in one direction</text><text start="5423.04" dur="5.52">doesn&apos;t have effects on</text><text start="5424.239" dur="4.321">other things of duh yep</text><text start="5429.6" dur="8.32">there&apos;s a difference also between</text><text start="5433.44" dur="7.52">the blue and fast</text><text start="5437.92" dur="5.68">are two different preferences</text><text start="5440.96" dur="4.56">that are arbitrary that both want to be</text><text start="5443.6" dur="3.36">associated with a car that don&apos;t have</text><text start="5445.52" dur="4.32">some</text><text start="5446.96" dur="4.08">um intrinsic unifying function and we</text><text start="5449.84" dur="1.839">can say blue is a thing that&apos;s</text><text start="5451.04" dur="4.0">reasonable to</text><text start="5451.679" dur="6.641">be preferential about color</text><text start="5455.04" dur="5.679">whereas i would say that there are some</text><text start="5458.32" dur="4.48">characteristics that have a synergistic</text><text start="5460.719" dur="3.281">effect that increasing one increases the</text><text start="5462.8" dur="5.839">other one because of</text><text start="5464.0" dur="6.4">the way they are part of a overall</text><text start="5468.639" dur="3.52">increase in system integrity and so</text><text start="5470.4" dur="2.799">synergy is the key concept i&apos;m trying to</text><text start="5472.159" dur="3.761">bring about here</text><text start="5473.199" dur="4.641">which is behavioral systems more than</text><text start="5475.92" dur="3.279">the sum of and unpredicted by the parts</text><text start="5477.84" dur="2.56">taken separately</text><text start="5479.199" dur="3.361">so when i say i&apos;m looking for</text><text start="5480.4" dur="6.239">synergistic satisfiers</text><text start="5482.56" dur="6.159">the idea that i have x amount of input</text><text start="5486.639" dur="3.921">and that input has to be divided between</text><text start="5488.719" dur="5.121">these various types of output and</text><text start="5490.56" dur="5.36">it&apos;s linear is nonsense i can have</text><text start="5493.84" dur="4.16">i can have x amount of input and have</text><text start="5495.92" dur="4.799">something where the total amount of</text><text start="5498.0" dur="3.6">output has increased synergy based on</text><text start="5500.719" dur="3.281">the</text><text start="5501.6" dur="4.559">intelligence of the design the question</text><text start="5504.0" dur="4.159">of how do we design in a way that is</text><text start="5506.159" dur="3.761">optimizing synergy between all the</text><text start="5508.159" dur="2.641">things that matter becomes the central</text><text start="5509.92" dur="2.56">question</text><text start="5510.8" dur="3.68">yes which is of course the central</text><text start="5512.48" dur="2.4">question that selection must be dealing</text><text start="5514.48" dur="3.6">with</text><text start="5514.88" dur="5.6">in generating complex life</text><text start="5518.08" dur="3.92">and you know i don&apos;t again i don&apos;t think</text><text start="5520.48" dur="4.08">we have a hair&apos;s breadth</text><text start="5522.0" dur="3.44">of difference on what we turn out to</text><text start="5524.56" dur="2.8">believe</text><text start="5525.44" dur="3.36">about this trade-off space but what i</text><text start="5527.36" dur="2.96">would say is</text><text start="5528.8" dur="3.2">and i don&apos;t want to drag the audience</text><text start="5530.32" dur="5.12">too far down this road it&apos;s probably not</text><text start="5532.0" dur="5.84">worth it for what we need to do here but</text><text start="5535.44" dur="4.0">the benefit of being able to say so</text><text start="5537.84" dur="2.799">let&apos;s take your example of there are</text><text start="5539.44" dur="3.12">certain characteristics that will</text><text start="5540.639" dur="4.0">co-maximize</text><text start="5542.56" dur="4.96">not really because of the following</text><text start="5544.639" dur="6.721">thing let&apos;s say that we figure out</text><text start="5547.52" dur="6.32">what color is best for making</text><text start="5551.36" dur="4.08">the fastest car and then we say well i</text><text start="5553.84" dur="5.28">want to maximize</text><text start="5555.44" dur="5.68">grade 37 and speed now i can do it i can</text><text start="5559.12" dur="3.84">maximize gray 37 and speed because it</text><text start="5561.12" dur="2.48">just so happens that gray 37 is the</text><text start="5562.96" dur="2.239">color</text><text start="5563.6" dur="3.36">that has the best characteristics for</text><text start="5565.199" dur="3.52">speed right but then the point is you</text><text start="5566.96" dur="3.12">can&apos;t separate these two things whatever</text><text start="5568.719" dur="2.48">characteristic it is you&apos;re actually</text><text start="5570.08" dur="3.52">maximizing</text><text start="5571.199" dur="4.801">you&apos;ve just found two aspects of it so</text><text start="5573.6" dur="4.24">your point about synergy</text><text start="5576.0" dur="3.04">is that perfectly aligned</text><text start="5577.84" dur="4.56">characteristics</text><text start="5579.04" dur="5.84">we could describe that joint that</text><text start="5582.4" dur="3.68">fusion of those two things as one thing</text><text start="5584.88" dur="3.68">and we could maximize</text><text start="5586.08" dur="3.52">it right but then if we take the next</text><text start="5588.56" dur="2.48">one over</text><text start="5589.6" dur="3.119">right the next characteristic that we</text><text start="5591.04" dur="3.76">want to add to the list of things then</text><text start="5592.719" dur="5.121">again we&apos;re back in trade-off space so</text><text

start="5820.159" dur="2.721">actually a place where something you</text><text start="5821.76" dur="3.359">said caused me</text><text start="5822.88" dur="4.64">to complete a thought that i&apos;ve been</text><text start="5825.119" dur="5.681">working on for some time</text><text start="5827.52" dur="6.4">so the thought as it existed is</text><text start="5830.8" dur="3.52">that markets are excellent at figuring</text><text start="5833.92" dur="3.12">out</text><text start="5834.32" dur="4.48">how to do things and they are atrocious</text><text start="5837.04" dur="3.679">at telling us what to do</text><text start="5838.8" dur="4.0">in other words they will find every</text><text start="5840.719" dur="3.841">defect in human character and figure out</text><text start="5842.8" dur="2.56">how to exploit it if you allow them to</text><text start="5844.56" dur="3.04">do that</text><text start="5845.36" dur="3.04">but when you have a problem that you</text><text start="5847.6" dur="3.92">really want</text><text start="5848.4" dur="4.64">solved right how can we make a phone</text><text start="5851.52" dur="3.44">that doesn&apos;t require me to be plugged</text><text

dur="4.319">figuring out what the best solution is</text><text start="5863.76" dur="4.479">and so in some sense</text><text start="5865.199" dur="5.361">the question is how can we structure the</text><text start="5868.239" dur="2.88">incentives around the market so that</text><text start="5870.56" dur="3.28">markets</text><text start="5871.119" dur="5.441">only solve problems that we want them to</text><text start="5873.84" dur="5.839">solve but they can be free to solve them</text><text start="5876.56" dur="5.52">well and what</text><text start="5879.679" dur="3.841">what i think i realized in this</text><text start="5882.08" dur="4.079">conversation here</text><text start="5883.52" dur="3.84">is that in some sense the role of the</text><text start="5886.159" dur="4.721">citizenry</text><text start="5887.36" dur="6.799">in a democracy is to discuss</text><text start="5890.88" dur="4.0">the values that we want government to</text><text start="5894.159" dur="2.881">deploy</text><text start="5894.88" dur="4.0">incentives around in other words the</text><text start="5897.04" dur="4.0">people by deciding</text><text start="5898.88" dur="3.52">what their

dur="4.399">solved and which ones</text><text start="5907.36" dur="3.12">could take a back seat that that&apos;s the</text><text start="5909.679" dur="3.04">proper</text><text start="5910.48" dur="4.159">thing that we are to be discussing that</text><text start="5912.719" dur="2.881">the role of government freed from</text><text start="5914.639" dur="3.441">corruption</text><text start="5915.6" dur="3.44">would be to figure out what incentives</text><text start="5918.08" dur="4.24">will result</text><text start="5919.04" dur="5.119">in the best return on our investment</text><text start="5922.32" dur="3.359">structuring the incentives of the market</text><text start="5924.159" dur="4.321">and then the market can be freed</text><text start="5925.679" dur="3.841">to solve the narrowest problems on that</text><text start="5928.48" dur="3.12">list</text><text start="5929.52" dur="3.52">and i think we fail at every level here</text><text start="5931.6" dur="2.88">but from the point of view of what we&apos;re</text><text start="5933.04" dur="3.04">actually shooting for</text><text start="5934.48" dur="3.92">i would say it&apos;s somewhere in that</text><text start="5936.08" dur="5.2">neighborhood that division of labor</text><text start="5938.4" dur="3.68">between the citizens the apparatus of</text><text start="5941.28" dur="3.76">governance</text><text start="5942.08" dur="2.96">and the market</text><text start="5947.119" dur="3.441">i&apos;m suffering a little bit here because</text><text start="5948.48" dur="2.88">there&apos;s like 10 simultaneous threads</text><text start="5950.56" dur="2.48">that i really</text><text start="5951.36" dur="3.12">could address that are important and i</text><text

be worth doing actually so</text><text start="5964.84" dur="7.16">first i want to say something against</text><text start="5968.96" dur="4.64">heterodox market theory is i don&apos;t think</text><text start="5972.0" dur="6.84">the market is the best system</text><text start="5973.6" dur="8.16">for innovation of a known what</text><text start="5978.84" dur="4.359">um and i think uh</text><text start="5981.76" dur="3.28">world war ii and the manhattan project</text><text start="5983.199" dur="2.561">is a very clear example in the apollo</text><text start="5985.04" dur="2.96">project</text><text start="5985.76" dur="3.12">and our on our failure at fusion i would</text><text start="5988.0" dur="3.6">say that</text><text start="5988.88" dur="4.799">the point you&apos;re about to make to me</text><text start="5991.6" dur="3.84">fusion would be our top priority because</text><text start="5993.679" dur="5.52">it&apos;s the only plug-and-play</text><text start="5995.44" dur="6.239">solution to a large piece of our problem</text><text start="5999.199" dur="3.681">and the fact that we decade after decade</text><text start="6001.679" dur="4.0">are awaiting a</text><text start="6002.88" dur="5.52">proper fusion solution says you know</text><text start="6005.679" dur="4.48">despite the fact that the market could</text><text start="6008.4" dur="3.52">potentially solve it the problem is the</text><text start="6010.159" dur="2.48">investments are too large on the front</text><text start="6011.92" dur="2.799">end and</text><text start="6012.639" dur="3.441">the reward is too delayed for the market</text><text start="6014.719" dur="4.241">to actually even</text><text start="6016.08" dur="4.32">recognize the problem correctly venture</text><text start="6018.96" dur="4.159">capital is not going to put up the</text><text start="6020.4" dur="5.2">amount of money that a nation&apos;s day can</text><text start="6023.119" dur="3.281">for the amount of time that&apos;s necessary</text><text start="6025.6" dur="3.2">and</text><text start="6026.4" dur="4.16">when you look at the very largest jumps</text><text start="6028.8" dur="3.68">in innovative capacity a lot of them</text><text start="6030.56" dur="3.84">happen by nation state funding not</text><text start="6032.48" dur="4.639">market funding and then</text><text start="6034.4" dur="4.96">a market emerging in association with</text><text start="6037.119" dur="6.08">kind of government contracting</text><text start="6039.36" dur="6.319">and so if we like if we look at why the</text><text start="6043.199" dur="3.841">nazis were so technologically farther</text><text start="6045.679" dur="2.801">ahead than everyone else going into</text><text start="6047.04" dur="3.36">world war ii</text><text start="6048.48" dur="4.48">with the enigma machine in the beginning</text><text start="6050.4" dur="4.08">of computing with the v2 rocket</text><text start="6052.96" dur="3.84">it was not a market dynamic it was a</text><text start="6054.48" dur="4.239">state dynamic where they invested</text><text start="6056.8" dur="3.52">in science and technology development</text><text start="6058.719" dur="3.041">for a long time which is why this tiny</text><text start="6060.32" dur="3.2">little country with limited industrial</text><text start="6061.76" dur="3.04">supply capacity had more technological</text><text start="6063.52" dur="4.32">advancement than the</text><text start="6064.8" dur="4.96">soviets or the us and it was</text><text start="6067.84" dur="3.359">it was our ability to steal their [ __ ]</text><text start="6069.76" dur="3.12">and rip it off and then be bigger than</text><text start="6071.199" dur="2.881">them that was a big part of how we were</text><text start="6072.88" dur="4.319">able to</text><text start="6074.08" dur="4.559">succeed in the war effort and so</text><text start="6077.199" dur="2.96">that&apos;s a clear example that like</text><text start="6078.639" dur="2.321">computers were developed by a state not</text><text start="6080.159" dur="4.0">the market</text><text start="6080.96" dur="4.8">right hold on a second i want to be</text><text start="6084.159" dur="3.281">careful because i don&apos;t want to falsify</text><text start="6085.76" dur="3.6">something that isn&apos;t false i again think</text><text start="6087.44" dur="3.759">this is a place where our mappings</text><text start="6089.36" dur="3.12">uh or at least the language surrounding</text><text start="6091.199" dur="4.561">them is going to upend us</text><text start="6092.48" dur="5.84">because this sounds like a place where</text><text start="6095.76" dur="3.28">a government is capable of generating a</text><text start="6098.32" dur="2.64">massive</text><text start="6099.04" dur="3.679">incentive to cause a problem to be</text><text start="6100.96" dur="3.12">solved that the market won&apos;t even find</text><text start="6102.719" dur="3.681">on its own</text><text start="6104.08" dur="4.32">right so that does not strike me as</text><text start="6106.4" dur="2.719">inconsistent with what i was just saying</text><text start="6108.4" dur="2.88">the state</text><text start="6109.119" dur="3.681">recognizes there&apos;s a problem creates an</text><text start="6111.28" dur="4.64">incentive big enough</text><text start="6112.8" dur="3.919">to find the solution and that incentive</text><text start="6115.92" dur="2.64">can be</text><text start="6116.719" dur="2.96">uh big enough to cause people to get</text><text start="6118.56" dur="2.159">different degrees than they would</text><text start="6119.679" dur="5.44">otherwise</text><text start="6120.719" dur="6.241">seek and uh but in these cases it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="6125.119" dur="4.481">like so let&apos;s take the manhattan project</text><text start="6126.96" dur="4.32">it wasn&apos;t private contractors</text><text start="6129.6" dur="3.599">that solved it because the government</text><text start="6131.28" dur="4.0">had made the incentive it was actually</text><text start="6133.199" dur="5.281">government that solved it it was</text><text start="6135.28" dur="4.48">government employees and so this is a</text><text start="6138.48" dur="3.679">this important distinction</text><text start="6139.76" dur="3.2">nasa was not a private space contracting</text><text start="6142.159" dur="2.401">thing that did</text><text start="6142.96" dur="3.44">the apollo project it was a government</text><text start="6144.56" dur="4.72">project so</text><text start="6146.4" dur="4.319">i would say the largest jumps we ever</text><text start="6149.28" dur="3.839">made in tech</text><text start="6150.719" dur="3.281">did not happen in the market for the</text><text start="6153.119" dur="3.921">most part</text><text start="6154.0" dur="5.52">well so then i guess the test of</text><text start="6157.04" dur="4.4">your falsification here is the following</text><text start="6159.52" dur="5.52">question</text><text

dur="3.04">questions of the time is</text><text start="6416.08" dur="3.44">what is the basis of legitimate</text><text start="6417.679" dur="4.161">authority and how do we know and what is</text><text start="6419.52" dur="3.76">the basis of warranted trust</text><text start="6421.84" dur="3.6">because we all know what it means to</text><text start="6423.28" dur="4.0">have trust that isn&apos;t

it&apos;s</text><text start="6433.199" dur="4.081">unwarranted and</text><text start="6434.159" dur="5.361">they think that the people who trust</text><text start="6437.28" dur="3.839">the fda or vaccine scientists or the cdc</text><text start="6439.52" dur="4.8">have trust it&apos;s unwarranted</text><text start="6441.119" dur="5.04">we also know that legitimate authority</text><text start="6444.32" dur="3.6">the idea of legitimate authority is so</text><text start="6446.159" dur="3.841">powerful to be able to be the arbiters</text><text start="6447.92" dur="3.92">of what is true and what is real</text><text start="6450.0" dur="3.92">that anyone who is playing the game of</text><text start="6451.84" dur="3.359">power has a maximum incentive however</text><text start="6453.92" dur="4.0">successful they are to be able to</text><text start="6455.199" dur="5.44">capture and influence that for their</text><text start="6457.92" dur="4.239">good we also know that it&apos;s possible to</text><text start="6460.639" dur="4.56">mislead with</text><text start="6462.159" dur="6.241">with exclusively true facts</text><text start="6465.199" dur="6.241">that are cherry picked or

dur="4.241">distribution and tell any story i want</text><text start="6475.04" dur="3.599">that will make it through a fact checker</text><text start="6476.88" dur="3.759">so fact checking is valuable but not</text><text start="6478.639" dur="5.04">even close to sufficient</text><text start="6480.639" dur="4.641">um so i can lie through</text><text start="6483.679" dur="3.201">something like the atlantic as well as i</text><text start="6485.28" dur="3.04">can lie through something like breitbart</text><text start="6486.88" dur="3.44">through different mechanisms</text><text start="6488.32" dur="3.919">for different populations yeah this this</text><text start="6490.32" dur="5.04">is a super excellent point as well</text><text start="6492.239" dur="6.0">that a fact checker</text><text start="6495.36" dur="4.08">airs in one direction and if you can</text><text start="6498.239" dur="3.92">build a falsehood</text><text start="6499.44" dur="3.679">out of true objects that have been</text><text start="6502.159" dur="3.121">edited</text><text start="6503.119" dur="4.401">um then the fact checker won&apos;t spot it</text><text start="6505.28" dur="6.16">so love that point</text><text start="6507.52" dur="6.96">and so i can</text><text start="6511.44" dur="5.36">do a safety analysis on a drug</text><text start="6514.48" dur="3.84">and i&apos;m not looking at every metric that</text><text start="6516.8" dur="2.8">matters i&apos;m looking at some subset of</text><text start="6518.32" dur="2.879">the metrics and it might be that it&apos;s</text><text

only did the</text><text start="6525.119" dur="3.52">safety study for two years</text><text start="6526.48" dur="4.32">so i wouldn&apos;t notice that so i can say</text><text start="6528.639" dur="4.0">no methodologically this was perfect and</text><text start="6530.8" dur="3.2">sound it all just also doesn&apos;t matter</text><text start="6532.639" dur="2.48">because it wasn&apos;t i wasn&apos;t measuring the</text><text start="6534.0" dur="4.239">right things</text><text start="6535.119" dur="5.921">right and so this also uh</text><text start="6538.239" dur="4.721">basically what you have just said means</text><text start="6541.04" dur="4.88">that the replication crisis</text><text start="6542.96" dur="3.759">can be understood as a mechanism for</text><text start="6545.92"

have</text><text start="6555.84" dur="4.56">is the ability to choose between</text><text start="6558.32" dur="2.64">experiments where sampling error will</text><text start="6560.4" dur="3.68">result</text><text start="6560.96" dur="6.239">in uh both outcomes being</text><text start="6564.08" dur="3.519">evident somewhere this is another one of</text><text start="6567.199"

then say oh we just didn&apos;t know</text><text start="6580.88" dur="2.88">those factors right</text><text start="6582.639" dur="3.681">i&apos;m not saying that whether that&apos;s</text><text start="6583.76" dur="4.64">happening or not it certainly can happen</text><text start="6586.32" dur="4.24">okay so now we get back to so what is</text><text start="6588.4" dur="4.0">the how do you have a legitimate</text><text start="6590.56" dur="3.76">authority that has the power of being</text><text start="6592.4" dur="3.279">the arbiter of what is true and real and</text><text

dur="3.44">forcing function of the failure modes on</text><text start="6948.719" dur="3.281">both sides that&apos;s why it&apos;s important to</text><text start="6950.32" dur="3.6">look at oppression

in</text><text start="6999.04" dur="3.84">a book incidentally that&apos;s sort of what</text><text start="7001.84" dur="4.08">i see myself</text><text start="7002.88" dur="5.6">doing in biology is synthesis um</text><text start="7005.92" dur="3.759">but your point is the most important</text><text start="7008.48" dur="4.48">aspect of synthesis</text><text start="7009.679" dur="4.0">is it is a process right and so that</text><text start="7012.96" dur="4.159">process</text><text start="7013.679" dur="6.96">is the thing that takes these competing</text><text start="7017.119" dur="5.681">failure modes and rescues from them</text><text start="7020.639" dur="4.0">something that uh suffers neither</text><text start="7022.8" dur="5.2">consequence and</text><text start="7024.639" dur="6.721">heads towards optimality so i</text><text start="7028.0" dur="5.119">agree we have to get yeah so synthesis</text><text start="7031.36" dur="4.799">is an ongoing process</text><text start="7033.119" dur="4.961">and let&apos;s say i have some</text><text start="7036.159" dur="3.04">bits of true information and a thesis</text><text start="7038.08" dur="2.88">and some bits in the</text><text start="7039.199" dur="3.52">antithesis so the synthesis will have</text><text start="7040.96" dur="4.0">more bits in either of them higher order</text><text start="7042.719" dur="3.761">complexity but it will still have</text><text start="7044.96" dur="3.52">radically less bits</text><text start="7046.48" dur="3.92">of information than all of reality about</text><text start="7048.48" dur="2.239">that thing the model is never the thing</text><text start="7050.4" dur="4.0">right</text><text start="7050.719" dur="5.761">it&apos;s just it&apos;s the best epistemically we</text><text start="7054.4" dur="3.68">can do at that moment</text><text start="7056.48" dur="3.04">so now i want to go back to the earlier</text><text start="7058.08" dur="2.159">topic around theory of trade-offs that</text><text start="7059.52" dur="2.96">you said because</text><text start="7060.239" dur="3.44">i i let it go but as soon as you mention</text><text

the how but not the what which is</text><text start="7073.52" dur="3.44">the is odd distinction that comes up in</text><text start="7075.119" dur="4.08">science right yes it is</text><text start="7076.96" dur="3.36">science can do a good job of what is but</text><text start="7079.199" dur="2.801">not what ought</text><text start="7080.32" dur="4.64">which means applied science

start="7285.84" dur="4.879">to religious style beliefs it&apos;s actually</text><text start="7288.719" dur="4.801">the way we do science also</text><text start="7290.719" dur="4.641">you know we have approximations and you</text><text start="7293.52" dur="3.599">know things get ugly when people forget</text><text start="7295.36" dur="3.279">that that&apos;s what they&apos;re dealing

uh</text><text start="7347.92" dur="5.92">you were on a roll</text><text start="7358.48" dur="3.28">so you&apos;ll see</text><text start="7362.159" dur="4.56">conversations from really smart

because of the complexity of the</text><text start="7380.32" dur="3.68">issues that we face</text><text start="7381.599" dur="3.201">that are beyond what the smartest person</text><text start="7384.0" dur="4.4">could</text><text start="7384.8" dur="6.399">manage by a lot is the only answer</text><text start="7388.4" dur="4.0">to build a benevolent ai overlord that</text><text start="7391.199" dur="2.721">can run a one world</text><text start="7392.4" dur="3.68">government because it can process the</text><text start="7393.92" dur="4.719">information to make good choices</text><text start="7396.08" dur="3.68">so as you can guess my answer is</text><text start="7398.639" dur="4.161">vigorously no</text><text start="7399.76" dur="4.8">yep not just because i think the</text><text start="7402.8" dur="3.2">optimization function that it would run</text><text start="7404.56" dur="3.52">no matter how many variables would end</text><text start="7406.0" dur="6.159">up becoming a paperclip maximizer</text><text start="7408.08" dur="4.96">but uh i think its own existential risks</text><text start="7412.159" dur="3.921">are bound up</text><text start="7413.04" dur="3.92">in that process these guys know know</text><text start="7416.08" dur="3.039">this</text><text start="7416.96" dur="3.52">but it&apos;s easy to pick solutions like</text><text start="7419.119" dur="2.0">that compared to the other ones that</text><text start="7420.48" dur="4.32">seem</text><text start="7421.119" dur="7.52">maybe even more likely to go terrible</text><text start="7424.8" dur="7.6">so then we say okay we don&apos;t want</text><text start="7428.639" dur="6.0">a one world government run by</text><text start="7432.4" dur="4.08">any of the people we currently have and</text><text start="7434.639" dur="3.44">we also don&apos;t want separate nations</text><text start="7436.48" dur="3.84">where any of them that defect lead</text><text start="7438.079" dur="3.6">everybody into a race to the bottom</text><text start="7440.32" dur="3.2">so that means that they have to have</text><text start="7441.679" dur="3.681">rule of law over each other because they</text><text start="7443.52" dur="3.52">affect common spaces</text><text start="7445.36" dur="2.799">so how do you have rule of law over each</text><text start="7447.04" dur="3.52">other without it being one world</text><text start="7448.159" dur="4.321">government and then capture</text><text start="7450.56" dur="3.84">oppression or chaos at various scales</text><text start="7452.48" dur="3.44">and the only answer is the comprehensive</text><text start="7454.4" dur="2.16">education enlightenment of the people</text><text start="7455.92" dur="3.92">that can</text><text start="7456.56" dur="4.8">check

dur="3.759">a movement towards the possibility of</text><text start="7471.679" dur="2.96">some freedoms from the feudalism it came</text><text start="7473.599" dur="4.401">from</text><text

through the filters</text><text start="8768.24" dur="2.72">like facebook it&apos;s going through the</text><text start="8769.359" dur="3.841">filters of the fact that people have</text><text

the same</text><text start="9145.2" dur="3.68">right but then here&apos;s the the place that</text><text start="9147.2" dur="4.88">the thought goes</text><text start="9148.88" dur="6.64">so is it true that if somebody</text><text start="9152.08" dur="5.68">intelligent says something um</text><text start="9155.52" dur="3.04">that is completely inconsistent with my</text><text start="9157.76"

dur="4.0">to look at it it&apos;s a tough question</text><text start="9166.16" dur="5.44">because if i</text><text start="9166.88" dur="8.72">if i try some test cases if you told me</text><text start="9171.6" dur="6.64">that uh you believed that there was a</text><text start="9175.6" dur="5.04">strong chance that the earth was flat</text><text start="9178.24" dur="3.52">okay that would throw a huge error for</text><text start="9180.64" dur="4.4">me right</text><text start="9181.76" dur="6.96">because i know a that i&apos;ve checked</text><text start="9185.04" dur="5.279">right in fact i have years ago and</text><text start="9188.72" dur="2.8">several times said what are the chances</text><text start="9190.319" dur="1.761">there&apos;s anything that these flat</text><text

possibility and so the answer is</text><text start="9200.72" dur="2.719">okay</text><text start="9201.68" dur="4.719">i&apos;m not going to spend too much time</text><text start="9203.439" dur="6.641">checking with it right</text><text start="9206.399" dur="6.401">then we get to is the moon landing fake</text><text start="9210.08" dur="3.92">right this one is tougher right it&apos;s</text><text start="9212.8" dur="3.36">tougher because when you look</text><text start="9214.0" dur="3.76">at the actual evidence that people are</text><text start="9216.16" dur="4.319">motivated to hypothesize</text><text start="9217.76" dur="4.4">the moon landing is fake there are some</text><text start="9220.479" dur="3.201">things in it that are hard to know i</text><text start="9222.16" dur="2.159">don&apos;t often know what the explanation</text><text start="9223.68" dur="2.96">for them is</text><text start="9224.319" dur="3.921">so anyway my point is there are some</text><text start="9226.64" dur="3.12">ideas i wouldn&apos;t be shocked at all</text><text start="9228.24" dur="3.76">to find that you believe there&apos;s some</text><text start="9229.76" dur="3.679">ideas i would be so shocked that i would</text><text start="9232.0" dur="4.72">imagine you&apos;re kidding</text><text start="9233.439" dur="5.761">or um you&apos;ve lost your mind or</text><text start="9236.72" dur="4.719">i don&apos;t know what and so we all draw</text><text start="9239.2" dur="3.119">that line somewhere and i guess my point</text><text start="9241.439" dur="3.361">is i think</text><text start="9242.319" dur="3.12">almost everybody even very very smart</text><text start="9244.8" dur="2.4">people</text><text start="9245.439"

creates</text><text start="9253.52" dur="7.2">a fatal error when independence</text><text start="9257.28" dur="5.36">is experimented with right</text><text start="9260.72" dur="4.0">that the number of things that you know</text><text start="9262.64" dur="3.759">it is the matrix in some sense once you</text><text start="9264.72" dur="2.719">start experimenting with what would i</text><text

gave</text><text start="9271.76" dur="3.44">everybody a chance to articulate their</text><text start="9273.68" dur="4.88">position</text><text start="9275.2" dur="5.199">what comes back is so jarring that</text><text start="9278.56" dur="4.24">most people are driven back into</text><text start="9280.399" dur="6.161">conventional automatic thinking</text><text start="9282.8" dur="4.32">because the the frightening aspects of</text><text start="9286.56" dur="3.04">what</text><text start="9287.12" dur="3.199">what they get in response are enough to</text><text start="9289.6" dur="3.68">drive them</text><text start="9290.319" dur="2.961">off the instinct</text><text start="9293.359" dur="6.481">yes okay god there&apos;s so much in here</text><text start="9295.359" dur="4.481">that&apos;s really good</text><text start="9302.8" dur="3.28">the thing about the flat earth is that</text><text start="9305.12" dur="4.64">it is</text><text start="9306.08" dur="5.44">the hypothesis is formally falsifiable</text><text start="9309.76" dur="4.08">and the alternative even by an</text><text start="9311.52" dur="4.72">individual yes</text><text start="9313.84" dur="4.479">and it&apos;s though the alternative</text><text start="9316.24" dur="3.44">hypothesis is formally verifiable with</text><text start="9318.319" dur="4.401">the best methods that we have with</text><text start="9319.68" dur="5.04">the highest confidence we can have</text><text start="9322.72" dur="3.28">and now one thing i would still say is</text><text start="9324.72" dur="3.36">interesting is</text><text start="9326.0" dur="3.52">i know many people who refer to flat</text><text start="9328.08" dur="3.76">earthers as the</text><text start="9329.52" dur="3.52">moniker of maximum stupidity who cannot</text><text start="9331.84" dur="5.12">do the copernican</text><text start="9333.04" dur="4.64">proof so they take as an article of</text><text start="9336.96" dur="2.24">faith</text><text start="9337.68" dur="3.44">that the earth is round but they</text><text start="9339.2" dur="3.52">actually don&apos;t know how to drive it have</text><text start="9341.12" dur="3.359">never tried and so</text><text start="9342.72" dur="3.44">then they also moved to taking as an</text><text start="9344.479" dur="3.361">article of faith similar things that</text><text start="9346.16" dur="4.4">don&apos;t have the same basis</text><text start="9347.84" dur="4.639">so if so does someone even understand</text><text start="9350.56" dur="3.2">what falsifiable and verifiable mean</text><text start="9352.479" dur="3.361">does someone have a basis for</text><text start="9353.76" dur="6.16">calibrating their confidence margin</text><text start="9355.84" dur="6.32">because if if i start to talk about</text><text start="9359.92" dur="2.24">um</text><text start="9363.28" dur="4.159">the moon landing or then i go a little</text><text start="9365.68" dur="4.48">bit further and talk about</text><text start="9367.439" dur="4.481">long-term autoimmune effects or</text><text start="9370.16" dur="4.319">epigenetic drift or whatever they come</text><text start="9371.92" dur="4.24">from a vaccine schedule of 72 vaccines</text><text start="9374.479" dur="6.081">together</text><text start="9376.16" dur="6.239">is the standard narrative falsifiable</text><text

that we put flat earth and</text><text start="9386.319" dur="5.04">anti-vax in the same category is a</text><text start="9388.479" dur="9.361">intellectually dishonest bad thing to do</text><text

like</text><text start="9401.6" dur="3.839">with the lab hypothesis when you come to</text><text start="9403.439" dur="3.04">90 i&apos;m guessing you have a process for</text><text start="9405.439"

start="9779.359" dur="2.401">worse which is the thing that we</text><text start="9780.479" dur="2.321">mentioned earlier which is you can do</text><text start="9781.76" dur="3.28">the

to</text><text start="9810.319" dur="3.441">just join the consensus so that i am not</text><text start="9812.8" dur="3.04">rejected</text><text start="9813.76" dur="3.679">at the same time if everyone

dur="3.281">ends up being a i don&apos;t know the answer</text><text start="9847.279" dur="2.241">to this trolley problem before i get</text><text start="9848.72" dur="4.4">there</text><text start="9849.52" dur="6.72">right so what i have to say is</text><text start="9853.12" dur="6.72">is the basis by which the other people</text><text start="9856.24" dur="3.6">all agreed that you were wrong</text><text start="9860.8" dur="3.12">deliberative and methodological and</text><text start="9863.359" dur="3.601">earnest</text><text start="9863.92" dur="5.519">and free of motivated reasoning does it</text><text start="9866.96" dur="4.24">have a group motivated reasoning that&apos;s</text><text start="9869.439" dur="3.681">associated with it</text><text start="9871.2" dur="3.52">are there you know clear blind spots in</text><text start="9873.12" dur="4.8">the thing you&apos;re thinking so</text><text start="9874.72" dur="6.4">i i don&apos;t think there&apos;s an answer to the</text><text start="9877.92" dur="5.68">what actually is right there there is no</text><text start="9881.12" dur="3.6">methodology it&apos;s the doubt that&apos;s</text><text start="9883.6" dur="2.56">eternal is not</text><text start="9884.72" dur="3.759">that the speaker&apos;s not the eternal doubt</text><text start="9886.16" dur="4.48">the methodology that&apos;s formalizable</text><text start="9888.479" dur="3.441">is not the thing that reveals the the</text><text start="9890.64" dur="3.839">tao right like</text><text start="9891.92" dur="4.24">ultimately you have to end up adding</text><text start="9894.479" dur="3.601">placebo at a certain point and then</text><text start="9896.16" dur="3.52">double blinding and then randomization</text><text start="9898.08" dur="1.92">the methods have to keep getting better</text><text start="9899.68" dur="2.719">because</text><text start="9900.0" dur="3.84">there&apos;s always something in the letter</text><text start="9902.399" dur="2.241">of the law that doesn&apos;t get the spirit</text><text start="9903.84" dur="2.479">of the law</text><text start="9904.64" dur="3.679">and then the letter of the methodology</text><text start="9906.319" dur="4.481">that doesn&apos;t get actual science right</text><text start="9908.319" dur="4.08">right and in fact so a couple things</text><text start="9910.8" dur="5.2">here one</text><text start="9912.399" dur="6.721">there&apos;s a part of the scientific method</text><text start="9916.0" dur="5.52">which is a black box</text><text start="9919.12" dur="4.56">there&apos;s a part that actually i believe</text><text start="9921.52" dur="4.0">literally cannot be taught</text><text start="9923.68" dur="3.36">right it is the part where you formulate</text><text start="9925.52" dur="5.04">a hypothesis</text><text start="9927.04" dur="6.08">right that is a that is a</text><text start="9930.56" dur="4.08">personal process if i taught somebody to</text><text start="9933.12" dur="2.319">do it my way that i don&apos;t think they do</text><text start="9934.64" dur="2.88">it very well</text><text start="9935.439" dur="4.161">right so the point is that&apos;s something</text><text start="9937.52" dur="4.16">that you learn to do</text><text start="9939.6" dur="3.679">through some process that is mostly not</text><text start="9941.68" dur="4.56">conscious hard to</text><text start="9943.279" dur="4.641">hard to teach and hard to discover but</text><text start="9946.24" dur="3.199">everybody who does it well does it in</text><text start="9947.92" dur="4.399">some different way</text><text start="9949.439" dur="3.761">and so at that level even just saying do</text><text start="9952.319" dur="3.12">the method</text><text start="9953.2" dur="3.52">is incomplete because not everybody can</text><text start="9955.439" dur="4.641">do the method</text><text start="9956.72" dur="6.88">um see there was something else</text><text start="9960.08" dur="5.12">uh oh yeah</text><text start="9963.6" dur="2.799">there was there was a missing thing on</text><text start="9965.2" dur="2.8">your list i realized you weren&apos;t trying</text><text start="9966.399" dur="3.681">to be exhausted but there was a missing</text><text start="9968.0" dur="3.439">thing on the list of possible reasons</text><text start="9970.08" dur="3.52">that you could come up against a</text><text start="9971.439" dur="4.241">consensus and still be right even if</text><text start="9973.6" dur="5.08">you&apos;re the only person who disagrees</text><text start="9975.68" dur="5.36">and it has to do with the</text><text start="9978.68" dur="3.48">non-independence of the data points on</text><text start="9981.04" dur="4.72">the other side</text><text start="9982.16" dur="4.319">based on let&apos;s say either a perverse</text><text start="9985.76" dur="3.92">incentive</text><text start="9986.479" dur="5.521">or a school of thought having won out</text><text start="9989.68" dur="4.08">and killed off all of the diversity of</text><text start="9992.0" dur="3.6">thought over some issue that turns out</text><text start="9993.76" dur="4.16">to matter</text><text start="9995.6" dur="3.04">and these things can very easily so i</text><text start="9997.92" dur="2.479">would say yes</text><text start="9998.64" dur="3.52">if you always think you&apos;re right and</text><text start="10000.399" dur="4.401">when everybody&apos;s against you</text><text start="10002.16" dur="4.319">uh they&apos;re wrong then yeah narcissism is</text><text start="10004.8" dur="4.88">a strongly likely reason</text><text start="10006.479" dur="4.241">on the other hand it is as you point out</text><text start="10009.68" dur="4.48">with tesla</text><text start="10010.72" dur="5.759">and their competitors</text><text start="10014.16" dur="4.4">sometimes you find that a field or an</text><text start="10016.479" dur="4.0">industry is easy to beat</text><text start="10018.56" dur="3.68">that there&apos;s something about them that</text><text start="10020.479" dur="2.481">is you know maybe economically very</text><text start="10022.24" dur="2.88">robust</text><text start="10022.96" dur="3.519">but with respect to their capacity has</text><text start="10025.12" dur="3.12">become feeble</text><text start="10026.479" dur="4.96">and this is true again and again in</text><text start="10028.24" dur="6.72">scientific fields that scientific fields</text><text start="10031.439" dur="6.801">go through a process where they</text><text start="10034.96" dur="6.479">a school of thought delivers</text><text start="10038.24" dur="5.68">handsomely on some insight</text><text start="10041.439" dur="3.441">it wins the power to own the entire</text><text start="10043.92" dur="3.2">field</text><text start="10044.88" dur="3.76">that insight runs its course diminishing</text><text start="10047.12" dur="4.64">return sets in</text><text start="10048.64" dur="3.6">it stops delivering anything new it</text><text start="10051.76" dur="2.32">doesn&apos;t</text><text start="10052.24" dur="3.28">give up the reins and hand them over to</text><text start="10054.08" dur="3.44">somebody else because there&apos;s no</text><text

burned out its value</text><text start="10061.359" dur="6.641">stick to their you know their power</text><text start="10065.2" dur="3.44">and that means that the field is wide</text><text start="10068.0" dur="3.12">open</text><text start="10068.64" dur="3.36">to be beaten by an outsider who just</text><text start="10071.12" dur="2.56">simply isn&apos;t</text><text start="10072.0"

that</text><text start="10077.52" dur="3.28">there is this</text><text start="10078.88" dur="3.04">it&apos;s artificially common that you have</text><text start="10080.8" dur="2.24">the experience if

disagree with just about</text><text start="10085.359" dur="3.201">everybody and they&apos;ll actually turn out</text><text start="10087.2" dur="3.84">to be wrong because</text><text start="10088.56"

dur="4.8">uncorruptable</text><text start="10114.319" dur="6.16">and then the the axioms</text><text start="10117.76" dur="3.36">and the kind of logical propositions get</text><text start="10120.479"

the</text><text start="10129.84" dur="4.08">progression of knowledge</text><text start="10131.68" dur="4.639">then at any point we come to realize</text><text start="10133.92" dur="4.72">that a

the</text><text start="10417.12" dur="5.92">principle makes sense</text><text start="10419.04" dur="7.279">what do you think so something like</text><text start="10423.04" dur="5.279">sustainability

dur="3.441">reversibility is a valuable</text><text start="10448.16" dur="4.4">consideration</text><text start="10449.84" dur="2.72">that is</text><text start="10453.76" dur="2.32">um</text><text

like</text><text start="10512.479" dur="3.201">um</text><text start="10513.68" dur="3.92">i can only think about reversibility on</text><text start="10515.68" dur="3.679">very narrowly defined metrics

dur="4.88">and so we have to understand the</text><text start="10523.2" dur="5.76">reversibility by its</text><text start="10526.88" dur="3.76">by itself is an oversimplification</text><text

dur="7.199">losing orcas or you know elephants or</text><text start="10617.04" dur="4.8">eagles or whatever so obviously you need</text><text start="10620.399" dur="4.561">to have a</text><text

dur="4.641">world here for</text><text start="10868.24" dur="3.119">humans to make use of but that we are in</text><text start="10870.96" dur="3.519">effect</text><text start="10871.359" dur="6.401">obligated to do it</text><text start="10874.479" dur="5.281">that belief fits perfectly in a world</text><text start="10877.76" dur="4.0">where if your population doesn&apos;t capture</text><text start="10879.76" dur="3.2">a resource somebody else is going to so</text><text start="10881.76" dur="3.679">in other words</text><text start="10882.96" dur="4.399">that belief structure travels along with</text><text start="10885.439" dur="3.521">a tendency to capture the resources that</text><text start="10887.359" dur="3.841">are available</text><text start="10888.96"

start="10903.68" dur="4.32">the modern circumstance so</text><text start="10905.439" dur="3.761">what we have is a place where there&apos;s</text><text start="10908.0" dur="4.24">lots of</text><text start="10909.2" dur="5.52">stuff that is um</text><text start="10912.24" dur="4.239">conservative that there&apos;s a very good</text><text start="10914.72" dur="2.32">and often hidden reason that we

conservation of the natural</text><text start="10926.24" dur="4.0">world</text><text start="10926.72" dur="3.52">is i think a clear case</text><text start="10933.6" dur="3.2">just because you mentioned this case</text><text start="10935.52" dur="5.839">when when</text><text start="10936.8" dur="6.88">people realize that christendom spread</text><text start="10941.359" dur="4.721">largely by holy war not exclusively but</text><text start="10943.68" dur="2.4">largely</text><text start="10946.88" dur="3.76">you need a religion that makes a lot of</text><text start="10948.96" dur="3.439">people that are willing to die in holy</text><text start="10950.64" dur="4.48">war because of a good afterlife</text><text start="10952.399" dur="4.321">and who you can spare right a lot large</text><text start="10955.12" dur="2.56">population of people that can die and</text><text start="10956.72" dur="3.44">war</text><text start="10957.68" dur="3.28">and islam and christianity both had this</text><text start="10960.16" dur="3.199">they both had</text><text start="10960.96" dur="3.84">um be fruitful and multiply and</text><text start="10963.359" dur="3.521">proselytize</text><text start="10964.8" dur="3.76">because they both had war as a strategy</text><text start="10966.88" dur="4.16">for propagation of the memes</text><text start="10968.56" dur="3.52">so you needed numbers whereas judaism</text><text start="10971.04" dur="3.92">didn&apos;t have it</text><text start="10972.08" dur="4.239">right and quakerism and some other ones</text><text start="10974.96" dur="3.76">didn&apos;t judaism had to</text><text start="10976.319" dur="3.361">actually make it hard for people to join</text><text start="10978.72" dur="2.48">the religion</text><text start="10979.68" dur="2.799">because you&apos;re not going to lose a lot</text><text start="10981.2" dur="3.119">of people as soldiers you&apos;re going to</text><text start="10982.479" dur="3.601">embed yourself as a diaspora within</text><text start="10984.319" dur="3.361">dominant cultures and end up affecting</text><text start="10986.08" dur="3.12">the apparatus of those cultures</text><text start="10987.68" dur="3.44">so it&apos;s interesting to think about how</text><text start="10989.2" dur="4.32">those different memeplexes had different</text><text start="10991.12" dur="3.92">evolutionary adaptations but it&apos;s</text><text start="10993.52" dur="5.12">important for the reason you mentioned</text><text start="10995.04" dur="4.56">is that those traditions were influenced</text><text start="10998.64" dur="3.6">by politics</text><text start="10999.6" dur="4.08">and economics and war and philosophy and</text><text start="11002.24" dur="5.68">culture and a lot of things</text><text start="11003.68" dur="5.84">so you can&apos;t wholesale throw them out or</text><text start="11007.92" dur="3.92">keep them or like you have to actually</text><text start="11009.52" dur="3.68">understand what allowed those memes to</text><text start="11011.84" dur="3.599">propagate and what their memetic</text><text start="11013.2" dur="4.0">propagation dynamics were</text><text start="11015.439" dur="2.88">and so that conservative impulse it says</text><text start="11017.2" dur="2.56">the things that made it through made it</text><text start="11018.319" dur="2.481">through for a reason yes but some of the</text><text start="11019.76" dur="2.24">things that made it through for a reason</text><text start="11020.8" dur="3.519">won&apos;t keep making it through</text><text start="11022.0" dur="3.68">dinosaurs were around for a long time</text><text start="11024.319" dur="3.761">and then they weren&apos;t</text><text start="11025.68" dur="4.48">right so um and as we&apos;ve mentioned</text><text start="11028.08" dur="4.48">evolution can be blind and run</text><text start="11030.16" dur="4.0">very effectively into cul-de-sacs and</text><text start="11032.56" dur="5.04">yet the other side is</text><text start="11034.16" dur="5.76">all too often we will criticize</text><text start="11037.6" dur="4.0">a tradition for being dumb when we don&apos;t</text><text start="11039.92" dur="3.04">understand what made it work well enough</text><text start="11041.6" dur="2.0">and we throw something out that was</text><text start="11042.96" dur="2.96">actually</text><text start="11043.6" dur="3.2">worth not throwing out so how do you do</text><text start="11045.92" dur="4.0">a deep enough</text><text start="11046.8" dur="5.36">historical understanding to be able to</text><text start="11049.92" dur="4.479">decide what should be conserved and not</text><text start="11052.16" dur="4.0">is is also a really good question it&apos;s a</text><text start="11054.399" dur="2.241">really important question because it&apos;s</text><text start="11056.16" dur="2.96">it&apos;s</text><text start="11056.64" dur="3.12">chesterton&apos;s fence factory effectively</text><text start="11059.12" dur="3.6">right</text><text start="11059.76" dur="4.4">nobody

dur="2.48">along with it because they were paired</text><text start="11068.64" dur="4.16">very closely</text><text start="11069.6" dur="5.44">in a biblical text and uh</text><text start="11072.8"
