dur="3.28">states</text><text start="204.56" dur="3.44">you spend a lot of time thinking about</text><text start="205.84" dur="4.319">existential and catastrophic risks</text><text start="208.0" dur="4.08">something what is it 35 percent of the</text><text start="210.159" dur="3.921">voters right now believe this election</text><text start="212.08" dur="3.68">maybe a quarter is existential

about</text><text start="221.92" dur="3.76">where this election is going</text><text start="224.0" dur="4.239">just broadly i wonder if you had any</text><text start="225.68" dur="4.16">introductory thoughts about</text><text start="228.239" dur="3.041">does this election matter that much what</text><text start="229.84" dur="4.08">does this election</text><text start="231.28" dur="3.679">um mean

start="242.56" dur="4.239">yeah i&apos;ll say i have</text><text start="243.76" dur="4.64">more questions about it than um very</text><text start="246.799" dur="3.121">solid predictions but</text><text start="248.4" dur="2.8">a few things in terms how i&apos;m looking at</text><text start="249.92" dur="2.319">it what are you looking for what&apos;s</text><text start="251.2" dur="2.72">interesting to you what do you think the</text><text start="252.239" dur="4.0">outcomes</text><text start="253.92" dur="3.36">what do you think what are the stakes i</text><text start="256.239" dur="4.161">think this</text><text start="257.28" dur="6.0">election is unique in um</text><text start="260.4" dur="4.48">modern history of having two things both</text><text

dur="4.28">anticipates the election being stolen or</text><text start="271.84" dur="4.079">rigged or somehow</text><text start="272.96" dur="4.56">unfairly judged to have questions around</text><text start="275.919" dur="3.521">the election integrity</text><text start="277.52" dur="3.6">so that no matter who ends up being</text><text start="279.44" dur="3.52">considered to win it will be considered</text><text start="281.12" dur="2.799">an illegitimate win by a huge percentage</text><text start="282.96" dur="4.0">of the population</text><text start="283.919" dur="4.72">and that combined with a huge percentage</text><text start="286.96" dur="2.72">of the population on both sides thinking</text><text start="288.639" dur="5.84">it&apos;s existential</text><text start="289.68" dur="7.76">so the uh trump camp</text><text start="294.479" dur="4.72">having many people that think if that</text><text start="297.44" dur="2.319">trump is the only thing that stands</text><text start="299.199" dur="4.321">between</text><text start="299.759" dur="5.681">some kind of globalist set of agendas</text><text start="303.52" dur="4.64">and the debasing of national

in will be the end of the</text><text start="312.96" dur="4.56">republic because he&apos;ll</text><text start="314.639" dur="4.801">uh create a dynasty and like formerly</text><text start="317.52" dur="4.959">the end of the republic so</text><text start="319.44" dur="4.88">what do we do in a situation where the</text><text start="322.479" dur="2.72">chance of the election being

incentive is for</text><text start="345.039" dur="5.681">inflammation</text><text start="347.039" dur="5.44">and we end up getting a situation where</text><text start="350.72" dur="3.36">the government is considered</text><text start="352.479" dur="2.481">illegitimate with an illegitimate</text><text start="354.08" dur="4.959">president</text><text start="354.96" dur="6.16">in an existentially consequential way to</text><text start="359.039" dur="3.681">coming up on half of the citizenry no</text><text start="361.12" dur="3.519">matter which way it goes i think this is</text><text start="362.72" dur="3.84">a huge issue and i think</text><text start="364.639" dur="4.0">you know rp our psu and ergo we&apos;re</text><text start="366.56" dur="3.04">looking at being able to predict social</text><text start="368.639" dur="3.921">violence</text><text start="369.6" dur="6.24">uh as it arose with the riots coming out</text><text start="372.56" dur="5.359">of the protests but from covid</text><text start="375.84" dur="3.44">we didn&apos;t know what would spark it we</text><text start="377.919" dur="2.881">knew there were like a handful of things</text><text start="379.28" dur="2.56">but we knew that when unemployment goes</text><text start="380.8" dur="3.839">up that much</text><text start="381.84" dur="3.76">the social violence possibility goes up</text><text start="384.639" dur="3.201">pretty heavily well</text><text start="385.6" dur="4.4">we still have very high unemployment we</text><text start="387.84" dur="3.199">have high evictions we have increasing</text><text start="390.0" dur="3.44">embodied</text><text start="391.039" dur="4.401">polarization around racial issues around</text><text start="393.44" dur="5.759">left-right issues around</text><text start="395.44" dur="6.64">mask no mask covet reality issues</text><text start="399.199" dur="4.321">and so now we&apos;re looking at this on top</text><text start="402.08" dur="5.36">of all of that</text><text start="403.52" dur="6.88">and the actual kind of like</text><text start="407.44" dur="3.92">insurgency and militia on both far right</text><text start="410.4" dur="4.0">and far left</text><text start="411.36" dur="4.88">preparation um</text><text start="414.4" dur="3.28">so i i think we&apos;re moving i think the</text><text start="416.24" dur="2.56">election is going to be really</text><text start="417.68" dur="4.56">problematic and i</text><text start="418.8" dur="6.799">would say for</text><text start="422.24" dur="5.76">or it very easily can be</text><text start="425.599" dur="5.681">i would say if there&apos;s a period of time</text><text start="428.0" dur="6.84">where it is contested and the u.s</text><text start="431.28" dur="7.6">doesn&apos;t have a clear executive branch</text><text start="434.84" dur="6.359">um what the rest of the world does</text><text start="438.88" dur="4.48">probably not towards the us directly but</text><text start="441.199" dur="3.041">as far as power grabs internationally</text><text start="443.36" dur="2.8">for the</text><text start="444.24" dur="3.519">for geopolitical influence is also a</text><text start="446.16" dur="4.8">very very big question not just what</text><text start="447.759" dur="4.72">happened socially domestically</text><text start="450.96" dur="4.56">one of the pieces of history i would say</text><text start="452.479" dur="5.761">is for people that don&apos;t have a good</text><text start="455.52" dur="4.72">thinking of history democracies don&apos;t</text><text start="458.24" dur="4.0">live very long historically they</text><text start="460.24" dur="4.799">typically die in less than 300 years</text><text start="462.24" dur="5.92">we&apos;re at about 250 years on this one</text><text start="465.039" dur="5.921">no civilization or empire is</text><text start="468.16" dur="3.52">enduring forever they all end up falling</text><text start="470.96" dur="2.959">and</text><text start="471.68" dur="3.919">there are certain characteristics that</text><text start="473.919" dur="3.521">when we look at the fall of previous</text><text start="475.599" dur="3.44">empires and previous democracies that we</text><text start="477.44" dur="4.0">can kind of find that</text><text start="479.039" dur="4.0">generally play out and we see those</text><text start="481.44" dur="2.479">types of things playing out pretty well</text><text start="483.039" dur="3.761">here</text><text start="483.919" dur="4.481">so for me and we already don&apos;t have</text><text start="486.8" dur="3.28">something that&apos;s really like a republic</text><text start="488.4" dur="3.04">we don&apos;t have a government of</text><text start="490.08" dur="3.839">for and by the people that are</text><text start="491.44" dur="5.599">comprehensively educated</text><text start="493.919" dur="4.4">are have a uh unbiased fourth estate</text><text start="497.039" dur="4.081">where they know what&apos;s going on</text><text start="498.319" dur="4.081">and they&apos;re actively engaged in the</text><text start="501.12" dur="2.799">functions of the state we have a</text><text start="502.4" dur="3.44">permanent political class with a</text><text start="503.919" dur="3.28">rotating door between the market that</text><text start="505.84" dur="2.96">it&apos;s supposed to regulate and the</text><text start="507.199" dur="3.12">regulators that end up getting captured</text><text start="508.8" dur="3.76">by it and</text><text start="510.319" dur="3.52">basically narrative and info warfare</text><text start="512.56" dur="4.399">having replaced news</text><text start="513.839" dur="6.961">and public education having been eroded</text><text start="516.959" dur="7.041">and so the question for me is</text><text start="520.8" dur="4.719">and then you also see that like</text><text start="524.0" dur="3.76">when you have term limits and we</text><text start="525.519" dur="4.32">understand why we have term limits</text><text start="527.76" dur="3.36">it&apos;s very hard to do long-term planning</text><text start="529.839" dur="2.881">for anyone who has an</text><text start="531.12" dur="3.6">incentive to have things that will pay</text><text start="532.72" dur="3.84">off within the time of their term limit</text><text start="534.72" dur="3.44">when you have massive left-right</text><text start="536.56" dur="2.64">polarization because of a two-party</text><text start="538.16" dur="3.28">system</text><text start="539.2" dur="4.0">you end up having so much of the energy</text><text start="541.44" dur="3.28">go into the coordination cost of just</text><text start="543.2" dur="2.48">getting elected and trying to keep what</text><text start="544.72" dur="2.88">everything you did</text><text start="545.68" dur="3.599">going that the ability to coordinate</text><text start="547.6" dur="4.56">well as a nation is very low</text><text start="549.279" dur="5.041">so then you see over the last 20 years</text><text start="552.16" dur="3.44">china&apos;s ability with something more like</text><text start="554.32" dur="3.12">an emperor ship to</text><text start="555.6" dur="3.359">build high-speed rail all around the</text><text start="557.44" dur="4.079">world and infrastructure all around the</text><text start="558.959" dur="6.641">world when we still can&apos;t fix roads</text><text start="561.519" dur="5.44">and between that and turkey and</text><text start="565.6" dur="3.52">venezuela and brazil</text><text start="566.959" dur="3.361">and movements in india we can see a more</text><text start="569.12" dur="3.44">autocratic direction</text><text start="570.32" dur="4.56">globally as one of the trends and we can</text><text start="572.56" dur="4.24">also see why is because the idea</text><text start="574.88" dur="4.0">of a democratic a participatory</text><text start="576.8" dur="3.2">governance where lots of people who see</text><text start="578.88" dur="2.8">the world differently</text><text start="580.0" dur="3.279">all work

dur="3.56">hydroxychloroquine masks covid whatever</text><text start="972.48" dur="3.2">right like</text><text start="973.519" dur="4.161">disagreement on base reality across so</text><text start="975.68" dur="3.519">many things</text><text start="977.68" dur="3.44">and the ability to say well let me look</text><text start="979.199" dur="3.361">at all the signs that really try to

just a place where</text><text start="985.44" dur="3.04">they start to resonate with both leaders</text><text start="988.0" dur="3.68">and</text><text start="988.48" dur="5.76">subgroups that are more

dur="2.8">purpose</text><text start="1009.839" dur="5.44">because then since people can&apos;t make</text><text start="1012.079" dur="5.68">sense of it then rhetoric works better</text><text

it&apos;s it&apos;s a belief system but it&apos;s</text><text start="1055.039" dur="2.88">all the way down to almost like a</text><text start="1056.32" dur="4.64">cultural aesthetic</text><text

dur="3.12">border issues or climate change issues</text><text start="1075.44" dur="4.0">so yes i would say</text><text start="1076.96" dur="3.04">epistemology being replaced by tribalism</text><text

one side of</text><text start="1274.88" dur="2.24">the equation all i&apos;m trying to say there</text><text start="1276.32" dur="3.92">is like</text><text start="1277.12" dur="5.76">it&apos;s almost

the last two</text><text start="1331.919" dur="4.0">presidents we&apos;ve had we went from a big</text><text start="1333.84" dur="3.76">time rock star superstar which was</text><text start="1335.919"

start="1349.28" dur="3.36">those two things may not go together all</text><text start="1350.88" dur="4.159">i&apos;m trying to say is if he if he&apos;d</text><text start="1352.64" dur="3.6">sought a

think about what joe biden</text><text start="1384.799" dur="2.801">is</text><text start="1385.76" dur="3.84">i mean you&apos;re talking about an old white</text><text start="1387.6" dur="4.0">guy

minimum like</text><text start="1407.84" dur="2.959">just put yourself</text><text start="1409.2" dur="3.359">in let&apos;s say biden wins and now it&apos;s</text><text start="1410.799" dur="4.24">august of 2021.</text><text start="1412.559" dur="3.441">what&apos;s going on is he really the</text><text start="1415.039" dur="2.401">charismatic leader</text><text start="1416.0" dur="3.28">that&apos;s changing this world is that</text><text start="1417.44" dur="3.44">really what&apos;s going to happen or is it</text><text start="1419.28" dur="4.08">just going to be noise city</text><text start="1420.88" dur="3.84">just all kinds of new kinds of noises</text><text start="1423.36" dur="2.88">that are coming from all these other</text><text start="1424.72" dur="3.52">weird places</text><text start="1426.24" dur="3.679">based on this new reality that maybe</text><text start="1428.24" dur="3.12">biden for the first time will teach us</text><text start="1429.919" dur="3.441">just how wild it is</text><text start="1431.36" dur="3.28">because this sort of calm older guy</text><text start="1433.36" dur="3.679">sitting at the middle of it</text><text start="1434.64" dur="4.48">and it&apos;s still not orderly that&apos;s what i</text><text start="1437.039" dur="5.201">fear</text><text start="1439.12" dur="7.6">anyway i just said a lot yeah so</text><text start="1442.24" dur="6.799">when i kind of hear you saying is um</text><text start="1446.72" dur="4.0">that the charisma of a person speaking</text><text start="1449.039" dur="3.201">is its own limbic hijack</text><text start="1450.72" dur="2.64">in addition whatever it is that the</text><text start="1452.24" dur="2.24">algorithms do and then you have an</text><text start="1453.36" dur="3.679">interplay between those</text><text start="1454.48" dur="4.4">right between you have the limbic hijack</text><text start="1457.039" dur="3.441">of what goes out on the media and then</text><text start="1458.88" dur="1.919">you have the limbic hijack of which of</text><text start="1460.48" dur="2.559">that</text><text start="1460.799" dur="4.721">is specially selected on my news feed</text><text start="1463.039" dur="4.961">based on my interaction with it</text><text start="1465.52" dur="4.24">and obviously the news feed can&apos;t</text><text start="1468.0" dur="3.44">olympically hijack me if it doesn&apos;t have</text><text start="1469.76" dur="2.32">content to put in there that has that</text><text start="1471.44" dur="2.88">effect</text><text start="1472.08" dur="4.24">right so you end up getting this</text><text start="1474.32" dur="4.239">reinforcement dynamic</text><text start="1476.32" dur="3.599">and you mentioned a benign evil so i&apos;m</text><text start="1478.559" dur="2.561">gonna just address the social media</text><text start="1479.919" dur="2.321">thing for a minute and then come back to</text><text start="1481.12" dur="4.24">the uh</text><text start="1482.24" dur="3.12">the president charisma thing</text><text start="1485.84" dur="3.04">yes the social media algorithms whether</text><text start="1487.919" dur="2.401">we&apos;re talking about youtube&apos;s</text><text start="1488.88" dur="5.2">recommended video algorithm</text><text start="1490.32" dur="3.76">or

dur="4.319">infringement it&apos;s not their intention</text><text start="1499.76" dur="3.36">like there there is nobody there saying</text><text start="1501.919" dur="5.12">we want to make</text><text start="1503.12" dur="7.439">you know antipa whatever um</text><text start="1507.039" dur="5.281">but in so far as they have to pick</text><text start="1510.559" dur="4.081">metrics to optimize and the thing is</text><text start="1512.32" dur="5.52">just as powerful as it is</text><text start="1514.64" dur="5.919">yeah and time on site is a good metric</text><text start="1517.84" dur="4.8">to optimize for and because</text><text start="1520.559" dur="3.761">of lots of reasons the advertising model</text><text start="1522.64" dur="4.159">is going to be relevant to how much time</text><text start="1524.32" dur="4.479">on site and how many people are coming</text><text start="1526.799" dur="3.601">but even beyond just the pay and the</text><text start="1528.799" dur="3.441">advertising model it&apos;s their way of</text><text start="1530.4" dur="2.24">sensing how much are people liking this</text><text start="1532.24" dur="4.08">thing</text><text start="1532.64" dur="3.68">right uh</text><text start="1536.799" dur="3.601">people&apos;s life is not that good spending</text><text start="1538.799" dur="2.961">that much time on facebook or

dur="3.92">right that they&apos;re in their kind of</text><text start="1545.2" dur="3.68">executive function prefrontal cortex</text><text start="1547.52" dur="2.96">they would check in quickly say i want</text><text start="1548.88" dur="2.799">to spend 15 minutes and then go about</text><text start="1550.48" dur="2.799">doing other things</text><text start="1551.679" dur="3.441">but it once they&apos;ve been scrolling for</text><text start="1553.279" dur="3.52">two hours that happened because they</text><text start="1555.12" dur="3.919">weren&apos;t in their executive function</text><text start="1556.799" dur="4.321">right it happened because either their</text><text start="1559.039" dur="3.681">fear of missing out or their desire for</text><text start="1561.12" dur="2.96">social cues because there&apos;s lonely and</text><text start="1562.72" dur="2.959">there&apos;s lots of faces on there and</text><text start="1564.08" dur="3.36">largely photoshopped faces</text><text start="1565.679" dur="3.041">or because of their political outrage</text><text start="1567.44" dur="3.04">whatever it is but</text><text start="1568.72" dur="3.36">it&apos;s

is not really well used time for</text><text start="1574.559" dur="4.48">them and</text><text start="1576.32" dur="4.239">so that drives addiction because that&apos;s</text><text start="1579.039" dur="4.0">olympic hijack</text><text start="1580.559" dur="4.161">right but it also drives things that</text><text start="1583.039" dur="5.201">scare me and things that anger me</text><text start="1584.72" dur="4.88">and um because if i see things that</text><text start="1588.24" dur="2.72">really scare me i&apos;m not going to leave</text><text start="1589.6" dur="2.079">i&apos;m going to feel like i need to know</text><text start="1590.96" dur="3.28">this</text><text start="1591.679" dur="4.24">but then if there&apos;s a billion pieces of</text><text start="1594.24" dur="3.36">news on a topic and there&apos;s no way i</text><text start="1595.919" dur="3.441">could ever take them all in</text><text start="1597.6" dur="3.679">what the youtube algorithm recommends</text><text

previous</text><text start="1604.32" dur="3.599">interactions the ones that i shared and</text><text start="1606.32" dur="3.2">clicked on whatever are most likely to</text><text start="1607.919" dur="4.401">have me share and click on them</text><text start="1609.52" dur="4.24">so that means that it appeals to bias</text><text start="1612.32" dur="3.52">and it appeals to</text><text

were some</text><text start="2967.04" dur="3.84">insurgency wars</text><text start="2968.88" dur="3.679">and i would say that that world that</text><text start="2970.88" dur="4.479">bretton woods set

dur="3.68">replaces it is a really big question</text><text start="2978.48" dur="3.52">here but since then we went from</text><text start="2980.4" dur="4.88">you know call it two superpowers

dur="4.64">catastrophe weapons</text><text start="2988.4" dur="5.12">as we&apos;re talking about cyber weapons can</text><text start="2991.68" dur="2.879">be catastrophic weapons now by taking</text><text start="2993.52" dur="4.079">out infrastructure</text><text start="2994.559" dur="5.28">and drone weapons are easy and unlike</text><text start="2997.599" dur="4.081">nukes that take nation state level</text><text start="2999.839" dur="2.561">capacity because uranium enrichment is</text><text start="3001.68" dur="2.24">hard</text><text start="3002.4" dur="3.679">drone weapons

globalization that that bretton</text><text start="3034.72" dur="3.04">woods</text><text start="3035.28" dur="4.24">world caused also caused a lot of</text><text start="3037.76" dur="3.2">fragility because what it meant was the</text><text start="3039.52" dur="2.96">world was so interconnected that if</text><text start="3040.96" dur="3.28">things broke down in one area you could</text><text start="3042.48" dur="3.52">start getting cascading breakdowns</text><text start="3044.24" dur="3.76">because of supply chains</text><text start="3046.0" dur="3.839">and so the world got to see oh wow we&apos;re</text><text start="3048.0" dur="3.119">very dependent on china for production</text><text start="3049.839" dur="3.361">of lots of things</text><text start="3051.119" dur="3.521">so what happens if a breakdown occurs in</text><text start="3053.2" dur="4.159">china right</text><text start="3054.64" dur="4.64">so one of the things that i saw kobit</text><text start="3057.359"

there&apos;s</text><text start="3403.92" dur="2.8">a lot of crazy words flying around that</text><text start="3405.44" dur="4.32">a lot of people are going to have to</text><text start="3406.72" dur="6.32">watch this twice to get but</text><text start="3409.76" dur="4.96">we&apos;re living it i think</text><text start="3413.04" dur="5.279">that the destruction of the amazon is a</text><text start="3414.72" dur="6.0">very real u.s national security threat</text><text start="3418.319" dur="3.121">and this is not in most people&apos;s</text><text start="3420.72" dur="3.599">awareness</text><text start="3421.44" dur="6.48">and so it ends up being this kind of</text><text start="3424.319" dur="5.361">leftist environmental issue or whatever</text><text start="3427.92" dur="3.679">but when you understand the hydrological</text><text start="3429.68" dur="4.159">pump of the amazon</text><text start="3431.599" dur="4.641">amazon&apos;s very big the water that is</text><text start="3433.839" dur="4.0">transpiring up through the trees</text><text start="3436.24" dur="3.04">that is then raining down on the trees</text><text start="3437.839" dur="3.041">keeping it a rainforest it&apos;s keeping it</text><text start="3439.28" dur="3.6">so lush and growing so fast that&apos;s the</text><text start="3440.88" dur="4.8">hydrological pump that water pump</text><text start="3442.88" dur="5.04">but it&apos;s pumping up excess water that</text><text start="3445.68" dur="4.0">then becomes north american rainfall</text><text start="3447.92" dur="3.6">a very significant percentage of total</text><text start="3449.68" dur="4.8">north american rainfall</text><text start="3451.52" dur="4.96">and so just like climate change has a</text><text start="3454.48" dur="5.04">point at which there&apos;s a positive</text><text start="3456.48" dur="3.68">feedback loop meaning with albedo effect</text><text start="3459.52" dur="4.079">in particular</text><text start="3460.16" dur="5.199">right if the snow being white is</text><text start="3463.599" dur="3.52">reflecting sunlight less snow cover</text><text start="3465.359" dur="4.561">reflects less sunlight heats faster and</text><text start="3467.119" dur="4.641">you get this kind of runway effect</text><text start="3469.92" dur="4.32">the similar thing with the amazon is</text><text start="3471.76" dur="5.68">that it&apos;s postulated at a certain point</text><text start="3474.24" dur="6.319">you get an enough loss of tree cover</text><text start="3477.44" dur="4.639">that you get decreased rainfall on the</text><text start="3480.559" dur="4.081">rain forest creating increased</text><text start="3482.079" dur="3.681">susceptibility to fires and whatever and</text><text start="3484.64" dur="4.08">you actually get a break of the</text><text start="3485.76" dur="4.72">hydrological pump and groups like noaa</text><text start="3488.72" dur="3.68">and nasa and other ones are</text><text start="3490.48" dur="3.76">modeling when that happens and there are</text><text start="3492.4" dur="2.159">forecasts anywhere from like a year from</text><text start="3494.24" dur="2.319">now</text><text start="3494.559" dur="4.24">to 20 years from now but like none are</text><text start="3496.559" dur="3.52">very long based on current rates of</text><text start="3498.799" dur="2.8">destruction of the amazon</text><text start="3500.079" dur="3.201">obviously you could just mess up the</text><text start="3501.599" dur="3.041">headwaters of the amazon in ecuador and</text><text start="3503.28" dur="3.519">mess the whole thing up</text><text start="3504.64" dur="4.24">so it doesn&apos;t it&apos;s not just again based</text><text start="3506.799" dur="4.081">on total acreage of</text><text start="3508.88" dur="3.76">farming or mining or whatever it&apos;s also</text><text start="3510.88" dur="5.28">based on criticality</text><text start="3512.64" dur="5.679">um but what would happen if that runaway</text><text start="3516.16" dur="4.24">break to the hydrological pump occurred</text><text start="3518.319" dur="4.24">that dropped north american rainfall by</text><text start="3520.4" dur="4.159">30 to 50 percent</text><text start="3522.559" dur="3.681">what that does to agriculture into our</text><text start="3524.559" dur="3.601">aquifers it</text><text start="3526.24" dur="3.04">basically means that we have lost food</text><text start="3528.16" dur="5.04">security and</text><text start="3529.28" dur="5.6">domestic kinds of independent capacity</text><text start="3533.2" dur="3.28">so i think that should be thought of as</text><text start="3534.88" dur="3.04">a national security threat and the state</text><text start="3536.48" dur="3.68">department should pay attention to it</text><text start="3537.92" dur="4.159">so but here&apos;s a perfect example of again</text><text start="3540.16" dur="3.76">i like your your induction this idea to</text><text start="3542.079" dur="2.641">us with a hyper object here&apos;s an example</text><text start="3543.92" dur="2.399">of something that</text><text start="3544.72" dur="3.839">is actually quite linear and gets the</text><text start="3546.319" dur="5.361">american farmer and the voter boom</text><text start="3548.559" dur="5.601">um and</text><text start="3551.68" dur="4.399">a unfortunately to some extent it&apos;s</text><text start="3554.16" dur="3.439">dependent on a belief in climate change</text><text start="3556.079" dur="3.04">and that whole science which</text><text start="3557.599" dur="3.281">a whole group of american voters aren&apos;t</text><text start="3559.119" dur="4.881">going to buy although</text><text start="3560.88" dur="5.199">president a president biden certainly</text><text start="3564.0" dur="3.92">does and interesting as you&apos;re saying</text><text start="3566.079" dur="3.921">this you might remember he mentioned the</text><text start="3567.92" dur="4.0">amazon rainforest in his debate</text><text start="3570.0" dur="4.0">with trump which i thought was very odd</text><text start="3571.92" dur="3.36">um maybe this is why he did i didn&apos;t</text><text start="3574.0" dur="2.96">think it was a really powerful</text><text start="3575.28" dur="3.44">thing for him to go for based on the</text><text start="3576.96" dur="2.96">voters he&apos;s trying to mobilize right now</text><text start="3578.72" dur="2.8">probably wrong</text><text start="3579.92" dur="3.36">um but here&apos;s an example of something</text><text start="3581.52" dur="5.599">where like i get it i buy it</text><text start="3583.28" dur="5.76">you you motivated me um i just kind of</text><text start="3587.119" dur="4.641">know with this system of government</text><text start="3589.04" dur="4.24">it ain&apos;t gonna happen like that message</text><text start="3591.76" dur="3.12">is not gonna get to the right people</text><text start="3593.28" dur="3.2">we&apos;re not gonna take behaviors that do</text><text start="3594.88" dur="2.56">that and you and i and some of our</text><text start="3596.48" dur="2.24">friends have talked about actually</text><text start="3597.44" dur="2.72">relatively creative and not that</text><text start="3598.72" dur="3.76">expensive ways to get them to stop</text><text start="3600.16" dur="6.0">bringing another rainforest right</text><text start="3602.48" dur="7.119">so we live in a system daniel where that</text><text start="3606.16" dur="5.28">very clear negative causal loop</text><text start="3609.599" dur="3.441">is going to continue because we don&apos;t</text><text start="3611.44" dur="3.2">know how to absorb it we live</text><text start="3613.04" dur="3.36">we have a complexity mismatch problem</text><text start="3614.64" dur="3.199">obviously with our decision makers</text><text start="3616.4" dur="3.28">we have an acceleration of history with</text><text start="3617.839" dur="2.881">our technology you know etc</text><text start="3619.68" dur="3.28">and then we live in this media</text><text start="3620.72" dur="5.44">environment where we don&apos;t share facts</text><text start="3622.96" dur="5.119">so so great</text><text start="3626.16" dur="3.28">work stating the problem set and it</text><text start="3628.079" dur="2.48">probably was worth getting into the</text><text start="3629.44" dur="2.639">actual central threat</text><text start="3630.559" dur="2.881">and my 11 year old left the room at that</text><text start="3632.079" dur="2.48">time so i&apos;m not going to get a call from</text><text start="3633.44" dur="3.119">some of his</text><text start="3634.559" dur="4.8">his friend&apos;s parents although i&apos;m sure i</text><text start="3636.559" dur="2.8">will for something else</text><text start="3639.76" dur="3.28">so let&apos;s begin to talk about if we can</text><text start="3642.64" dur="3.04">let&apos;s</text><text start="3643.04" dur="3.92">some solutions uh and it and i have a</text><text start="3645.68" dur="2.08">whole series of questions i want to get</text><text start="3646.96" dur="3.119">to but let&apos;s just</text><text start="3647.76" dur="3.28">let&apos;s open it up what do we do about it</text><text start="3650.079" dur="2.48">yeah</text><text start="3651.04" dur="3.039">tiny part of the problem statement on</text><text start="3652.559" dur="3.04">climate change just because it&apos;s going</text><text start="3654.079" dur="3.121">to be directly relevant to the solution</text><text start="3655.599" dur="5.121">yeah of course</text><text start="3657.2" dur="6.399">i would say our sense-making around</text><text start="3660.72" dur="2.879">climate change</text><text start="3663.68" dur="7.439">is actually very problematic</text><text start="3667.599" dur="5.041">uh not just sense making the climate but</text><text start="3671.119" dur="3.68">since making the</text><text start="3672.64" dur="3.199">related issues and the political climate</text><text start="3674.799" dur="3.04">and the the</text><text start="3675.839" dur="3.76">memetic climate of how people are going</text><text start="3677.839" dur="5.681">to relate to it</text><text start="3679.599" dur="5.441">so let&apos;s say that all of the scientists</text><text start="3683.52" dur="2.319">agreed on the climate change model which</text><text start="3685.04" dur="2.559">they don&apos;t</text><text start="3685.839" dur="4.081">right you actually have like call it the</text><text start="3687.599" dur="3.76">standard model which is ipcc</text><text start="3689.92" dur="4.159">but you have some very serious</text><text start="3691.359" dur="4.48">scientists like</text><text start="3694.079" dur="3.121">lovelock who think it&apos;s much more severe</text><text start="3695.839" dur="5.201">than the ipcc&apos;s model</text><text start="3697.2" dur="6.159">and hit jim hanson i mean he lays it out</text><text start="3701.04" dur="3.92">brilliantly and you&apos;ve got very serious</text><text start="3703.359" dur="3.76">scientists who are earnest who are not</text><text start="3704.96" dur="3.839">paid by oil companies like freeman dyson</text><text start="3707.119" dur="2.081">who think that it&apos;s less severe because</text><text start="3708.799" dur="2.8">of</text><text start="3709.2" dur="3.599">how he calculates nonlinear dynamics and</text><text start="3711.599" dur="3.601">so there&apos;s</text><text start="3712.799" dur="3.841">there is like some authentic scientific</text><text start="3715.2" dur="3.2">inquiry around it but let&apos;s say that</text><text start="3716.64" dur="4.0">there was just total consensus of the</text><text start="3718.4" dur="5.12">thing that we had to do there</text><text start="3720.64" dur="4.56">but the solution is bound up with the</text><text start="3723.52" dur="3.039">acceptance of the problem statement and</text><text start="3725.2" dur="3.359">the way it&apos;s presented in the public</text><text start="3726.559" dur="5.361">sphere so the solution is going to be</text><text start="3728.559" dur="4.881">carbon taxes um that have to get agreed</text><text start="3731.92" dur="3.199">upon as some international order and</text><text start="3733.44" dur="6.08">then there&apos;s this idea that</text><text start="3735.119" dur="6.96">that&apos;s going to slow gdp growth and</text><text start="3739.52" dur="4.16">uh so the us and whatever european</text><text start="3742.079" dur="3.52">countries agree to it</text><text start="3743.68" dur="5.04">if there are other countries like say</text><text start="3745.599" dur="7.121">china or iran that don&apos;t agree to it</text><text start="3748.72" dur="5.599">then they have marginal increase in gdp</text><text start="3752.72" dur="2.96">growth relative to us that they can</text><text start="3754.319" dur="3.921">continue to reinvest</text><text start="3755.68" dur="4.32">in silk road military whatever it is</text><text start="3758.24" dur="3.28">that increases their geopolitical</text><text start="3760.0" dur="4.4">position with regard to</text><text start="3761.52" dur="4.64">the rest of the world and so you&apos;ll see</text><text start="3764.4" dur="3.199">people rejecting climate change without</text><text start="3766.16" dur="1.84">ever really trying to make sense of</text><text start="3767.599" dur="1.601">climate</text><text start="3768.0" dur="2.96">change because they think the</text><text start="3769.2" dur="3.44">consequence of the solution affects</text><text start="3770.96"

dur="3.12">just</text><text start="3956.72" dur="2.8">say on that i</text><text start="3960.4" dur="5.04">i don&apos;t want people to have an optimism</text><text start="3962.559" dur="5.921">bias

dur="4.081">entrenchment of the problem set</text><text start="3996.48" dur="3.839">and then what we want to look at is what</text><text start="3998.64" dur="3.439">would a sufficient solution be and</text><text start="4000.319" dur="3.201">before we have a sufficient solution</text><text start="4002.079" dur="3.28">in the same way that problems can</text><text start="4003.52" dur="3.2">cascade can we start to get solution</text><text start="4005.359" dur="3.44">cascades where something that is not</text><text start="4006.72" dur="3.599">sufficient can give rise to more things</text><text start="4008.799" dur="3.76">that start to converge towards</text><text start="4010.319" dur="4.0">sufficient i like the idea the</text><text start="4012.559" dur="3.441">consilience

dur="3.359">the likelihood of many other positive</text><text start="4021.359" dur="2.96">things that start to converge towards</text><text start="4022.799" dur="5.121">sufficiency</text><text start="4024.319" dur="3.601">um and i&apos;ll i&apos;ll just say like</text><text start="4028.24" dur="3.359">so the consensus project has to do with</text><text start="4030.0" dur="4.079">how to

dur="3.119">has</text><text start="4438.56" dur="4.159">its scope of consequence is</text><text start="4440.719" dur="3.921">unprecedented but failure is not</text><text start="4442.719" dur="3.601">unprecedented in fact there&apos;s no other</text><text start="4444.64" dur="5.44">precedent</text><text start="4446.32" dur="3.76">okay so coming back to</text><text start="4450.48" dur="3.44">the idea of a liberal democracy for a</text><text start="4452.48" dur="2.4">moment i&apos;m going to make this kind of</text><text start="4453.92" dur="4.16">u.s</text><text start="4454.88" dur="4.96">centric and immediate is roughly you&apos;ve</text><text start="4458.08" dur="2.639">got these kind of three sectors you&apos;ve</text><text start="4459.84" dur="3.92">got this</text><text start="4460.719" dur="6.0">market thing you&apos;ve got this state</text><text start="4463.76" dur="4.8">thing and you&apos;ve got this civil society</text><text start="4466.719" dur="5.761">thing that is not market or state</text><text start="4468.56" dur="6.8">but is uh religions and community groups</text><text start="4472.48" dur="4.4">and other places where basically the</text><text start="4475.36" dur="3.839">cultural values</text><text start="4476.88" dur="2.319">act</text><text start="4480.64" dur="6.079">so the rough idea and i&apos;m not saying</text><text start="4484.48" dur="4.64">that this is adequate or true but the</text><text start="4486.719" dur="5.361">rough kind of idea is</text><text start="4489.12" dur="3.28">uh okay the we&apos;re gonna let the market</text><text start="4492.08" dur="3.92">do</text><text start="4492.4" dur="5.839">most of the modes of production and</text><text start="4496.0" dur="4.4">most of the incentive and most of the</text><text start="4498.239" dur="3.92">innovation because it&apos;s good at it</text><text start="4500.4" dur="3.44">and we don&apos;t want a central government</text><text start="4502.159" dur="3.121">that is too strong trying to do too much</text><text start="4503.84" dur="3.12">of that because we founded this country</text><text start="4505.28" dur="3.36">getting away from excessive powers of</text><text start="4506.96" dur="2.08">government and we want something that is</text><text start="4508.64" dur="3.12">more</text><text start="4509.04" dur="4.88">individual self-determining but we&apos;re</text><text start="4511.76" dur="5.6">not doing a pure laissez-faire market</text><text start="4513.92" dur="5.68">either we still make a state because we</text><text start="4517.36" dur="4.0">like the idea of rule of law because a</text><text start="4519.6" dur="6.0">market will have a market for</text><text start="4521.36" dur="7.52">nasty things like slaves and organs and</text><text start="4525.6" dur="5.44">uh whatever uh and so</text><text start="4528.88" dur="3.44">things that we like to call crime and be</text><text start="4531.04" dur="2.639">able to have a force to stop them and</text><text start="4532.32" dur="4.72">specifically</text><text start="4533.679" dur="3.361">it&apos;s recognized that</text><text start="4537.12" dur="5.039">even if if at t equals zero i gave</text><text start="4538.96" dur="5.04">everyone an exact equal amount of money</text><text start="4542.159" dur="3.681">in enough period of time we would get a</text><text start="4544.0" dur="3.36">power law distribution no matter what</text><text start="4545.84" dur="3.04">because some people are better at making</text><text start="4547.36" dur="3.04">money with it and then having more money</text><text start="4548.88" dur="2.64">gives them more ability to make more</text><text start="4550.4" dur="4.24">money and so</text><text start="4551.52" dur="4.96">the the power ends up being auto poetic</text><text start="4554.64" dur="4.079">and falling on power law distribution</text><text start="4556.48" dur="4.64">so then how how do the few people up</text><text start="4558.719" dur="4.801">here who have the incentive</text><text start="4561.12" dur="4.559">and capacity to maintain their</text><text start="4563.52" dur="5.04">asymmetric power</text><text start="4565.679" dur="3.441">not be excessively kind of inhumane to</text><text start="4568.56" dur="3.04">the rest</text><text start="4569.12" dur="3.52">of everybody else well everybody else</text><text start="4571.6" dur="2.88">pulls their power</text><text start="4572.64" dur="3.76">into this thing called a government of</text><text start="4574.48" dur="4.239">foreign by the people estate</text><text start="4576.4" dur="3.92">that has monopoly of violence it&apos;s going</text><text start="4578.719" dur="3.761">to have even more power than the most</text><text start="4580.32" dur="3.919">powerful economic actors have</text><text start="4582.48" dur="3.92">and it can bind them with rule of law</text><text start="4584.239" dur="3.681">and rule of law is where our cultural</text><text start="4586.4" dur="3.04">our values because the basis of</text><text start="4587.92" dur="4.08">jurisprudence is ethics</text><text start="4589.44" dur="5.92">right the basis of ethics is some kind</text><text start="4592.0" dur="5.04">of value system or metaphysics</text><text start="4595.36" dur="3.359">so we have some kind of value system</text><text start="4597.04" dur="3.76">that is the basis of jurisprudence at</text><text start="4598.719" dur="4.081">the basis of rule of law we bequeath</text><text start="4600.8" dur="4.16">a monopoly of violence to enforce rule</text><text start="4602.8" dur="4.96">of law to a state that had</text><text start="4604.96" dur="4.4">to be able to check largely the</text><text start="4607.76" dur="4.16">predatory aspects of markets</text><text start="4609.36" dur="3.2">the primary kind of role of the state&apos;s</text><text start="4611.92" dur="3.04">enforce</text><text start="4612.56" dur="3.52">rule of law is largely to keep people</text><text start="4614.96" dur="2.88">from doing things that they would</text><text start="4616.08" dur="3.52">otherwise have an incentive to do people</text><text start="4617.84" dur="4.8">or corporations</text><text start="4619.6" dur="4.079">and uh where we agree that that&apos;s not a</text><text start="4622.64" dur="2.8">good thing to do</text><text start="4623.679" dur="3.761">so the idea is that the purpose of the</text><text start="4625.44" dur="3.36">state is largely checking predatory</text><text start="4627.44" dur="2.88">aspects of markets while keeping</text><text start="4628.8" dur="3.28">functional aspects of markets but</text><text start="4630.32" dur="3.68">that&apos;s only possible as long as the</text><text start="4632.08" dur="4.079">people are checking the state</text><text start="4634.0" dur="3.199">because otherwise the representatives in</text><text start="4636.159" dur="4.56">the state</text><text start="4637.199" dur="4.881">will end up the market will seek to</text><text start="4640.719" dur="3.361">capture those representatives the</text><text start="4642.08" dur="3.119">watchdog issue the classic

and election budgets have to</text><text start="4657.76" dur="2.479">come from somewhere and whatever and</text><text start="4659.04" dur="2.08">then you start to get revolving door</text><text start="4660.239" dur="2.401">dynamics so</text><text start="4661.12" dur="4.0">the founding fathers knew this so they</text><text start="4662.64" dur="3.76">said you know comprehensive education

it</text><text start="5526.639" dur="3.6">and one if they think we missed the data</text><text start="5528.88" dur="3.44">set or miss waited something they can</text><text start="5530.239" dur="3.681">let us know and we will be continuously</text><text start="5532.32" dur="3.12">updating our models and correcting our</text><text start="5533.92" dur="2.719">positions

dur="3.68">we got things wrong or missed stuff</text><text start="5540.56" dur="3.44">which is another important thing is a</text><text start="5542.0" dur="3.44">kind of epistemic humility for people

this if i didn&apos;t have this order to</text><text start="5554.96" dur="2.4">make sense of it for me if i went and</text><text start="5556.719" dur="2.081">looked at</text><text start="5557.36" dur="2.879">all of these different types of news</text><text start="5558.8" dur="2.879">sources from different countries and</text><text start="5560.239" dur="2.96">different political perspectives

hopefully well okay that&apos;s</text><text start="5570.48" dur="2.48">one part so</text><text start="5571.199" dur="3.281">basically that&apos;s the news the meta news</text><text start="5572.96" dur="3.04">is where we&apos;re not making sense of base</text><text start="5574.48" dur="2.96">reality but we&apos;re making sense of the</text><text start="5576.0" dur="4.719">media

dur="3.44">neat</text><text start="5602.639" dur="4.801">tool um to help us</text><text start="5605.679" dur="3.761">unders when they say this they&apos;re trying</text><text start="5607.44" dur="5.44">to you know fool you with anc</text><text start="5609.44" dur="5.279">you know blah blah you know yeah so that</text><text start="5612.88" dur="3.92">kind of commentary right so</text><text start="5614.719" dur="3.841">what we&apos;re seeking to do here is that</text><text start="5616.8" dur="3.76">this project is a non-profit it commits</text><text start="5618.56" dur="3.76">to have no

a</text><text start="5668.239" dur="3.361">lot of other groups to succeed</text><text start="5670.08" dur="3.84">and so i&apos;ll mention that in a moment the</text><text start="5671.6" dur="5.039">movement building part yeah</text><text start="5673.92" dur="4.239">that&apos;s a big question i have the meta</text><text start="5676.639" dur="3.841">news part is where</text><text start="5678.159" dur="3.841">we take some topic that is trending and</text><text start="5680.48" dur="6.32">highly polarized</text><text start="5682.0" dur="9.04">like masks or hydroxychloroquine or</text><text start="5686.8" dur="7.359">lab origins of covid or whatever it is</text><text start="5691.04" dur="4.72">and or</text><text start="5694.159" dur="4.08">police violence as a function of</text><text start="5695.76" dur="5.52">institutional racism in the us</text><text start="5698.239" dur="5.361">and we start by saying what is the</text><text start="5701.28" dur="3.76">landscape of primary narrative sometimes</text><text start="5703.6" dur="2.72">there&apos;s just two narratives there&apos;s kind</text><text start="5705.04" dur="2.56">of a left and a right narrative or</text><text start="5706.32" dur="2.799">whatever sometimes there&apos;s like five</text><text start="5707.6" dur="3.2">narratives there&apos;s also like a strong</text><text start="5709.119" dur="3.681">libertarian critique of both there&apos;s a</text><text start="5710.8" dur="3.28">conspiracy narrative whatever</text><text start="5712.8" dur="3.28">and of course there&apos;s a thousand</text><text start="5714.08" dur="3.44">sub-variants but they kind of cluster to</text><text start="5716.08" dur="3.68">some primary narrative</text><text start="5717.52" dur="3.44">structures or tropes so we do this thing</text><text start="5719.76" dur="2.8">in the meta news saying</text><text start="5720.96" dur="2.96">here&apos;s the narrative landscape of the</text><text start="5722.56" dur="2.24">things that are trending that a lot of</text><text start="5723.92" dur="3.199">people believe</text><text start="5724.8" dur="3.919">sure and then we steel man each</text><text start="5727.119" dur="3.12">narrative which is the opposite of straw</text><text start="5728.719" dur="3.681">manning which means we try to make the</text><text start="5730.239" dur="4.4">strongest case for it possible</text><text start="5732.4" dur="3.04">because most people who aren&apos;t in a</text><text start="5734.639" dur="2.321">narrative</text><text start="5735.44" dur="3.6">either don&apos;t know that the narrative</text><text start="5736.96" dur="2.4">exists or can only think that the people</text><text start="5739.04" dur="2.639">who</text><text start="5739.36" dur="4.24">believe it are just kind of dumb and bad</text><text start="5741.679" dur="3.52">they don&apos;t have a compelling</text><text start="5743.6" dur="2.88">understanding of why anyone could</text><text start="5745.199" dur="1.841">believe that thing because the version</text><text start="5746.48" dur="2.159">that</text><text start="5747.04" dur="2.96">that their social media algorithm is</text><text start="5748.639" dur="2.401">curating is the one that will appeal to</text><text start="5750.0" dur="2.88">outrage for them</text><text start="5751.04" dur="4.079">or whatever so we want to actually be</text><text start="5752.88" dur="4.88">able to help people understand</text><text start="5755.119" dur="3.921">actually what is com what the narratives</text><text start="5757.76" dur="3.04">are what&apos;s compelling about them this</text><text start="5759.04" dur="3.28">part of the socratic process of do we</text><text start="5760.8" dur="3.359">understand each other</text><text start="5762.32" dur="4.24">then we want to convert those narratives</text><text start="5764.159" dur="4.721">to a bunch of propositions and say what</text><text start="5766.56" dur="4.159">evidence is given to support these</text><text start="5768.88" dur="3.2">and then beyond that what evidence can</text><text start="5770.719" dur="3.92">we find to either</text><text start="5772.08" dur="4.079">formally falsify or verify and if we</text><text start="5774.639" dur="3.121">can&apos;t falsify or verify can we at least</text><text start="5776.159" dur="3.361">find things that make it more or less</text><text start="5777.76" dur="4.24">likely and how do we calibrate that</text><text start="5779.52" dur="3.84">so we&apos;re teaching people first to assess</text><text start="5782.0" dur="3.76">a narrative landscape</text><text start="5783.36" dur="4.24">then to empathize with other people in</text><text start="5785.76" dur="3.76">the form of can i try to really steel</text><text start="5787.6" dur="2.4">man their argument which is also good</text><text start="5789.52" dur="3.119">faith</text><text start="5790.0" dur="4.88">dialogue right then analytic</text><text start="5792.639" dur="4.161">propositional logic can i actually go</text><text start="5794.88" dur="3.12">through and because what will oftentimes</text><text start="5796.8" dur="3.12">happen is like this</text><text start="5798.0" dur="3.76">is true this is true therefore these</text><text start="5799.92" dur="3.44">eight propositions you already got me on</text><text start="5801.76" dur="2.959">these two these have no data but the</text><text start="5803.36" dur="3.52">people just kind of believe it</text><text start="5804.719" dur="4.081">right and that that type of thing we</text><text start="5806.88" dur="3.12">want to go through and be able to say</text><text start="5808.8" dur="2.879">because then what we&apos;ll also be able to</text><text start="5810.0" dur="2.0">show is in everyone&apos;s narrative there&apos;s</text><text start="5811.679" dur="2.401">some</text><text start="5812.0" dur="4.4">true stuff there is some signal which is</text><text start="5814.08" dur="4.559">actually also very important to realize</text><text start="5816.4" dur="3.839">then we can also see that across most of</text><text start="5818.639" dur="4.0">them there&apos;s some</text><text start="5820.239" dur="3.44">falsifiable like clearly nonsense but</text><text start="5822.639" dur="5.361">also a lot of just</text><text start="5823.679" dur="6.0">cherry-picked and spun stuff and then</text><text start="5828.0" dur="3.52">a lot of stuff that&apos;s pure conjecture</text><text start="5829.679" dur="3.121">that we can either falsify nor verify</text><text start="5831.52" dur="3.199">that is basically just</text><text start="5832.8" dur="3.6">spin or whatever we usually have low</text><text start="5834.719" dur="3.44">confidence then we step back and say</text><text start="5836.4" dur="3.279">what can we say with high confidence</text><text start="5838.159" dur="2.161">about this topic after having looked at</text><text start="5839.679" dur="2.161">all this</text><text start="5840.32" dur="4.08">so we&apos;re not saying unbiased we&apos;re</text><text start="5841.84" dur="6.0">saying we&apos;re taking each bias on purpose</text><text start="5844.4" dur="4.96">so we can bias correct right um</text><text start="5847.84" dur="3.279">so now one of the things that will</text><text start="5849.36" dur="4.4">happen is we&apos;ll also be able to show</text><text start="5851.119" dur="4.56">exemplars of each of the narratives like</text><text start="5853.76" dur="3.6">the top news sources and show okay</text><text

dur="3.52">we&apos;ve had times where people wanted to</text><text start="6647.28" dur="3.04">give money with strings attached we just</text><text start="6648.8" dur="3.68">told them to [ __ ]
