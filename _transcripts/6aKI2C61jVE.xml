<transcript><text start="9.019" dur="6.341">thank you</text><text start="11.4" dur="6.54">I just want to say thank you for this</text><text start="15.36" dur="4.98">welcome again from from the team at</text><text start="17.94" dur="5.419">Harvest it's great for me to have been</text><text start="20.34" dur="6.9">able to suggest Daniel as a speaker here</text><text start="23.359" dur="7.121">I'm very fond of him as a human as a</text><text start="27.24" dur="5.22">fellow futurist and as a thinker for our</text><text start="30.48" dur="3.3">time I think it probably this needs a</text><text start="32.46" dur="4.04">little introduction</text><text start="33.78" dur="5.88">you know why is Daniel here</text><text start="36.5" dur="5.98">Daniel is not a prophet of Doom</text><text start="39.66" dur="5.579">absolutely not he's trying to equip us</text><text start="42.48" dur="4.919">with the understanding that will help us</text><text start="45.239" dur="4.861">navigate some of the crises that are</text><text start="47.399" dur="5.041">ahead of us and something that some</text><text start="50.1" dur="3.959">people call The Meta crisis and he's one</text><text start="52.44" dur="3.959">of the main people in the world right</text><text start="54.059" dur="4.261">now who can explain it very clearly I'll</text><text start="56.399" dur="3.18">try and break it up a little bit so that</text><text start="58.32" dur="3.419">we can sort of go over some of the</text><text start="59.579" dur="4.62">points again it's difficult to sort of</text><text start="61.739" dur="3.301">say what consilience project is in a few</text><text start="64.199" dur="3.661">words</text><text start="65.04" dur="4.32">because it has evolved over time to sort</text><text start="67.86" dur="3.02">of confront the reality of what the</text><text start="69.36" dur="4.74">world is ready to accept</text><text start="70.88" dur="5.02">however it's certainly one of in my</text><text start="74.1" dur="3.72">opinions the best attempts and very</text><text start="75.9" dur="4.74">tangible attempts to help people</text><text start="77.82" dur="5.04">navigate what's right now in front of us</text><text start="80.64" dur="4.14">and the News cycle is certainly not</text><text start="82.86" dur="3.899">helping us understand it's so</text><text start="84.78" dur="3.54">distracting our minds from the real</text><text start="86.759" dur="4.5">things that are going on</text><text start="88.32" dur="4.979">and um so Daniel is one of these people</text><text start="91.259" dur="4.68">out there who's working really to</text><text start="93.299" dur="6.18">formalize the way that we can anticipate</text><text start="95.939" dur="5.941">connect uh collaborate and work more</text><text start="99.479" dur="6.661">effectively to solve problems that we</text><text start="101.88" dur="4.26">are facing So Daniel</text><text start="108.06" dur="4.44">I think there's something that we should</text><text start="110.04" dur="4.619">know about your past</text><text start="112.5" dur="4.799">and I'm going to be provocative</text><text start="114.659" dur="5.701">if you didn't actually start out with</text><text start="117.299" dur="7.5">the same objective you sort of thought</text><text start="120.36" dur="7.56">that maybe we were doomed and that we</text><text start="124.799" dur="4.74">had to accelerate Doom in order to get</text><text start="127.92" dur="3.3">somewhere I'm going to be very</text><text start="129.539" dur="4.021">provocative so that you can explain your</text><text start="131.22" dur="3.18">journey from a young man to where you</text><text start="133.56" dur="4.319">are now</text><text start="134.4" dur="5.699">I was homeschooled and when I was nine I</text><text start="137.879" dur="4.981">was at a gas station in a factory</text><text start="140.099" dur="5.041">farming cattle truck pulled up and so I</text><text start="142.86" dur="3.78">went and looked inside the holes the cow</text><text start="145.14" dur="3.54">nearest me was missing its eye and</text><text start="146.64" dur="2.84">bleeding all the cows were in terrible</text><text start="148.68" dur="2.76">condition</text><text start="149.48" dur="4.899">and uh</text><text start="151.44" dur="4.86">I grew up loving animals eating meat</text><text start="154.379" dur="2.761">from factory farms not putting the two</text><text start="156.3" dur="3.6">together</text><text start="157.14" dur="4.739">and I was just kind of shocked and</text><text start="159.9" dur="3.6">horrified by that asked my parents about</text><text start="161.879" dur="3.661">it they said that's where animals come</text><text start="163.5" dur="3.9">from so I asked to go to a factory farm</text><text start="165.54" dur="4.559">and</text><text start="167.4" dur="4.919">I started you know I became a vegetarian</text><text start="170.099" dur="4.321">that day started working with pita and</text><text start="172.319" dur="2.941">Greenpeace and studying animal rights</text><text start="174.42" dur="3.12">work</text><text start="175.26" dur="4.559">that took me from the issue of factory</text><text start="177.54" dur="3.96">farming to the issue of species</text><text start="179.819" dur="3.301">Extinction wailing overfishing the</text><text start="181.5" dur="3.9">oceans which took me into the issues of</text><text start="183.12" dur="3.839">the environment and that took me into</text><text start="185.4" dur="3.9">Global poverty and just kind of the</text><text start="186.959" dur="4.621">whole set of issues as a young person I</text><text start="189.3" dur="3.96">was fortunate being homeschooled that I</text><text start="191.58" dur="3.6">got to just have that be my curriculum I</text><text start="193.26" dur="3.54">was actually a</text><text start="195.18" dur="3.54">um</text><text start="196.8" dur="3.24">educational experiment my parents ran</text><text start="198.72" dur="2.7">where I didn't have any fixed curriculum</text><text start="200.04" dur="3.66">I just got a study what I was interested</text><text start="201.42" dur="5.22">in so this became the context of most of</text><text start="203.7" dur="4.8">my life study and</text><text start="206.64" dur="5.94">the next really important part happened</text><text start="208.5" dur="5.879">I was 13 I was working on a project at</text><text start="212.58" dur="4.2">Greenpeace and World Wildlife Federation</text><text start="214.379" dur="4.261">were leading to protect elephant</text><text start="216.78" dur="3.48">poaching in a particular</text><text start="218.64" dur="3.42">elephant Preserve in Kenya where the</text><text start="220.26" dur="3.839">poachers had come in Over The Preserve</text><text start="222.06" dur="4.02">and hunted a bunch of elephants</text><text start="224.099" dur="3.78">I saw the videos of the elephant</text><text start="226.08" dur="4.799">Slaughter and was moved in the same way</text><text start="227.879" dur="4.5">as the factory farms and the thing I</text><text start="230.879" dur="3.0">observed though was over the two years</text><text start="232.379" dur="3.241">of the people on the ground working</text><text start="233.879" dur="2.94">extremely hard to protect the elephants</text><text start="235.62" dur="3.42">there</text><text start="236.819" dur="3.541">the strategy was get bigger fences</text><text start="239.04" dur="3.779">Around The Preserve so the poachers</text><text start="240.36" dur="4.08">couldn't get in and do legislation to</text><text start="242.819" dur="2.761">get harsher sentencing for poachers in</text><text start="244.44" dur="2.64">the area</text><text start="245.58" dur="4.019">all the activists had their life</text><text start="247.08" dur="4.019">threatened but they finally succeeded it</text><text start="249.599" dur="3.601">was a huge win those elephants didn't</text><text start="251.099" dur="3.181">get hunted but they didn't address the</text><text start="253.2" dur="2.58">poverty of the people that were doing</text><text start="254.28" dur="2.94">the poaching they didn't address a</text><text start="255.78" dur="3.0">macroeconomy that creates poverty at</text><text start="257.22" dur="3.06">scale they didn't address the views</text><text start="258.78" dur="4.08">towards animals or identity regarding</text><text start="260.28" dur="4.56">them or black markets on animal parts so</text><text start="262.86" dur="3.42">the same poaching groups moved to hunt</text><text start="264.84" dur="2.76">other things which happened to be the</text><text start="266.28" dur="2.639">White Rhino and the mountain gorilla</text><text start="267.6" dur="3.06">both of which were more endangered than</text><text start="268.919" dur="3.121">the elephant and I was working with</text><text start="270.66" dur="3.18">enough groups that I got to see those</text><text start="272.04" dur="4.62">other issues get worse as a direct</text><text start="273.84" dur="5.34">result of the success of that project</text><text start="276.66" dur="4.08">and then that was that was like the</text><text start="279.18" dur="3.84">second existential hit the first</text><text start="280.74" dur="4.98">existential hit with the factory farms</text><text start="283.02" dur="4.679">was and I'm saying this to relate that</text><text start="285.72" dur="5.4">was the first time I had like a suicidal</text><text start="287.699" dur="5.22">ideation around not feeling okay being</text><text start="291.12" dur="4.62">complicit with my species that my</text><text start="292.919" dur="6.301">species was somehow fundamentally</text><text start="295.74" dur="5.34">up and but as a kid I'm it wasn't that</text><text start="299.22" dur="2.94">hard to realize if I kill myself all</text><text start="301.08" dur="2.58">those cows are still in the factory</text><text start="302.16" dur="6.0">farms they didn't help them that's</text><text start="303.66" dur="6.66">unethical but then I'm like if I</text><text start="308.16" dur="4.68">stay alive to try to help it like</text><text start="310.32" dur="4.379">couldn't can my life be a success well</text><text start="312.84" dur="3.299">sentient beings are experiencing that</text><text start="314.699" dur="3.301">much suffering</text><text start="316.139" dur="3.601">like what does it say about me that I</text><text start="318.0" dur="3.54">can be totally stoked that my life is a</text><text start="319.74" dur="3.299">success when other beings are in that</text><text start="321.54" dur="4.2">kind of suffering I'm like there's no</text><text start="323.039" dur="4.621">answer for me that doesn't address that</text><text start="325.74" dur="3.299">so I remember thinking to myself then</text><text start="327.66" dur="3.18">I'm like all right well if I die and</text><text start="329.039" dur="4.5">factory farms still exist I failed like</text><text start="330.84" dur="3.6">there is no definition of success for me</text><text start="333.539" dur="3.421">that</text><text start="334.44" dur="5.16">isn't a sociopath definition of success</text><text start="336.96" dur="3.84">it has to empathetically separate uh too</text><text start="339.6" dur="3.12">intensely</text><text start="340.8" dur="3.899">but at least the Hope Came that like</text><text start="342.72" dur="3.36">activism might work and so then when</text><text start="344.699" dur="3.241">this thing happened where I saw that the</text><text start="346.08" dur="3.42">activism for one thing made other things</text><text start="347.94" dur="3.06">worse that was the next kind of</text><text start="349.5" dur="3.3">devastation</text><text start="351.0" dur="3.12">and that led to me starting to look at</text><text start="352.8" dur="3.119">how many other places where we were</text><text start="354.12" dur="4.919">doing activism where the world was doing</text><text start="355.919" dur="5.821">activism did that kind of issue and I</text><text start="359.039" dur="4.741">saw that there were projects to solve</text><text start="361.74" dur="4.2">Global poverty by creating hydroelectric</text><text start="363.78" dur="4.859">dams to bring electricity to areas in</text><text start="365.94" dur="4.52">the hydroelectric dams of course drowned</text><text start="368.639" dur="5.461">whole ecosystems and extincted species</text><text start="370.46" dur="7.26">and on and on and kind of like it seemed</text><text start="374.1" dur="5.7">like the world was caught in these uh</text><text start="377.72" dur="3.64">trade-offs where when they would focus</text><text start="379.8" dur="3.78">on solving one problem it was too</text><text start="381.36" dur="3.899">narrowly defined the result of solving</text><text start="383.58" dur="4.679">that problem would have externalities</text><text start="385.259" dur="5.041">related with larger systems I started to</text><text start="388.259" dur="4.321">do kind of historical analysis on that</text><text start="390.3" dur="4.679">and that became kind of a defining trend</text><text start="392.58" dur="4.2">of all of the issues we we created the</text><text start="394.979" dur="3.481">automobile to solve a transportation</text><text start="396.78" dur="3.479">issue which was that horses were a very</text><text start="398.46" dur="3.54">limited means of transportation horses</text><text start="400.259" dur="4.081">in the cities caused a lot of horse shed</text><text start="402.0" dur="3.96">in places like London literally the</text><text start="404.34" dur="3.18">excessive horseshit in the cities of</text><text start="405.96" dur="3.359">London was one of the kind of like</text><text start="407.52" dur="4.2">significant impetuses to make a</text><text start="409.319" dur="4.021">Horseless Carriage and in solving that</text><text start="411.72" dur="3.3">problem and creating transportation that</text><text start="413.34" dur="3.9">increased mobility and comfort for the</text><text start="415.02" dur="4.44">whole world climate change like the</text><text start="417.24" dur="4.32">venusification of the entire planet and</text><text start="419.46" dur="3.959">oil spills and Wars over oil in the U.S</text><text start="421.56" dur="3.359">petrodollar like all of that were the</text><text start="423.419" dur="3.301">side effects of solving a transportation</text><text start="424.919" dur="2.761">issue you know a couple hundred years</text><text start="426.72" dur="4.44">later</text><text start="427.68" dur="5.34">and I got to see that there was this</text><text start="431.16" dur="5.52">underlying</text><text start="433.02" dur="4.92">deep issue that statecraft that is</text><text start="436.68" dur="2.94">thinking about the well-being of its own</text><text start="437.94" dur="3.24">citizens the rest of the world so it's</text><text start="439.62" dur="3.84">not just exporting its harm somewhere</text><text start="441.18" dur="3.66">else and of the planet and there's a lot</text><text start="443.46" dur="3.06">of countries where their Genie</text><text start="444.84" dur="3.479">coefficient meaning their measure of</text><text start="446.52" dur="3.42">wealth inequality is pretty good within</text><text start="448.319" dur="3.061">their country but they import a bunch of</text><text start="449.94" dur="3.06">stuff to make their country function</text><text start="451.38" dur="3.36">from countries that have the worst Genie</text><text start="453.0" dur="3.36">coefficient so you can't actually do</text><text start="454.74" dur="3.06">Genie coefficients at the level of a</text><text start="456.36" dur="3.119">country it ends up just being a way to</text><text start="457.8" dur="3.78">kind of whitewash the reality of Global</text><text start="459.479" dur="3.361">Supply chains oh so the conscious</text><text start="461.58" dur="4.32">statecraft thing</text><text start="462.84" dur="4.62">so how how do you do what is good for</text><text start="465.9" dur="3.06">your own country what's good for other</text><text start="467.46" dur="3.179">countries and what's good for the planet</text><text start="468.96" dur="3.12">when there are fundamental trade-offs</text><text start="470.639" dur="3.06">between them and you're stuck in those</text><text start="472.08" dur="3.72">trade-offs that becomes really the Deep</text><text start="473.699" dur="4.44">challenging question if we look at</text><text start="475.8" dur="4.619">climate change today we can see that for</text><text start="478.139" dur="4.68">the planet and for all of us in the</text><text start="480.419" dur="3.9">future we should not just decarbonize</text><text start="482.819" dur="3.6">but degrowth</text><text start="484.319" dur="4.141">we can also see that any nation that</text><text start="486.419" dur="4.021">tries to lead that will do worse GDP</text><text start="488.46" dur="4.38">wise in the near term which means worse</text><text start="490.44" dur="4.379">geopolitically and actually so much</text><text start="492.84" dur="4.56">worse particularly for the leading</text><text start="494.819" dur="4.621">countries like U.S and China uh change</text><text start="497.4" dur="4.1">the control systems of the world so so</text><text start="499.44" dur="4.199">many of the people in the U.S that are</text><text start="501.5" dur="3.759">anti-climate change aren't actually</text><text start="503.639" dur="3.601">anti-climate change because they did a</text><text start="505.259" dur="4.201">good analysis of the ipcc science it's</text><text start="507.24" dur="3.66">that the solution of increasing the</text><text start="509.46" dur="3.9">price of carbon for us which will</text><text start="510.9" dur="3.96">decrease our GDP relative to China's GDP</text><text start="513.36" dur="4.619">in a great power game which will</text><text start="514.86" dur="5.099">increase planetary autocracy seems like</text><text start="517.979" dur="3.24">such a bad solution that they don't want</text><text start="519.959" dur="2.341">the climate change assessment because</text><text start="521.219" dur="3.301">they don't want the solution that goes</text><text start="522.3" dur="5.34">with it so um</text><text start="524.52" dur="5.22">so that a part of the thing that I</text><text start="527.64" dur="3.9">um focus on is how do we understand the</text><text start="529.74" dur="3.48">interconnectivity and the generators of</text><text start="531.54" dur="3.12">all the issues deeply enough that we can</text><text start="533.22" dur="2.64">come up with solutions that don't cause</text><text start="534.66" dur="4.08">other problems</text><text start="535.86" dur="5.22">and uh but one point was a little while</text><text start="538.74" dur="5.46">after this I had come to</text><text start="541.08" dur="4.5">I started doing forecasting on</text><text start="544.2" dur="4.259">um how many people have read limits of</text><text start="545.58" dur="4.98">growth the MIT Club of Rome book so I</text><text start="548.459" dur="3.901">read that as a teenager and then started</text><text start="550.56" dur="4.08">looking at a lot of other analyzes on</text><text start="552.36" dur="3.84">species Extinction and biodiversity loss</text><text start="554.64" dur="4.74">and dead zones and oceans and all those</text><text start="556.2" dur="4.56">things and then I looked at the you know</text><text start="559.38" dur="3.48">Stephen Pinker kind of stuff of</text><text start="560.76" dur="3.78">everything's getting better A lot of</text><text start="562.86" dur="3.84">people might have that question of like</text><text start="564.54" dur="3.54">you hear Stephen Pinker Hans rossling</text><text start="566.7" dur="3.12">Gates and like everything's getting</text><text start="568.08" dur="3.24">better and then you hear all the</text><text start="569.82" dur="3.42">environmental statistics and like</text><text start="571.32" dur="3.84">everything's getting worse they're both</text><text start="573.24" dur="3.9">true you can cherry pick your stats but</text><text start="575.16" dur="3.9">they're not equally true the things that</text><text start="577.14" dur="5.46">are getting worse are leading to the</text><text start="579.06" dur="5.88">unviability of human habitation</text><text start="582.6" dur="4.38">ongoingly in a way that the things that</text><text start="584.94" dur="3.66">are getting better don't converge on</text><text start="586.98" dur="4.26">solving automatically</text><text start="588.6" dur="4.44">so there's a real and the things that</text><text start="591.24" dur="3.3">we're making better are causing the</text><text start="593.04" dur="3.239">things that are getting worse towards</text><text start="594.54" dur="3.78">self-extinction points right like grow</text><text start="596.279"

the</text><text start="940.8" dur="3.96">belief like you that basically having</text><text start="942.839" dur="4.141">better tools to understand the world we</text><text start="944.76"

end up in</text><text start="965.88" dur="4.5">a pretty bad place very quickly</text><text start="967.92" dur="4.62">so it could easily seem like the stuff</text><text start="970.38" dur="3.959">that

start="976.38" dur="4.98">I think it is true</text><text start="979.62" dur="2.7">the risks that we're talking about are</text><text start="981.36" dur="3.08">true</text><text start="982.32"

whole</text><text start="1060.08" dur="3.42">thing up so</text><text start="1061.299" dur="3.941">when you understand that all those</text><text start="1063.5" dur="3.6">problems are connected at

seems</text><text start="1074.179" dur="4.981">like a lot of complexity but it actually</text><text start="1076.22" dur="4.92">takes it from too many problems to</text><text start="1079.16"

dur="5.04">civilizations to have a life cycle and</text><text start="2136.839" dur="5.28">to fall but most of them fall for from</text><text start="2139.96" dur="4.26">internal self-terminating causes

start="2164.56" dur="4.38">that's important to understand it's just</text><text start="2166.66" dur="4.02">it was always a local phenomena</text><text start="2168.94" dur="3.78">this is the first time

dur="4.079">major reasons of the distrust of</text><text start="2701.26" dur="5.579">globalism is the idea that unchecked</text><text start="2703.839" dur="5.101">power doesn't have a good history and

dur="4.179">nation-states in competition with each</text><text start="2736.66" dur="3.78">other they just can't deal with global</text><text start="2738.819" dur="3.601">issues well if you have

Global</text><text start="2750.819" dur="3.601">governance it has to be able to deal</text><text start="2753.04" dur="3.96">with things like decentralized</text><text start="2754.42" dur="4.86">catastrophe weapons in basements but it</text><text start="2757.0" dur="4.44">also simultaneously has to have checks</text><text start="2759.28" dur="4.26">and balances on every power

take me a long time to describe</text><text start="2767.92" dur="4.08">what I think the best process is for how</text><text start="2769.9" dur="4.32">to do that are I will say that there are</text><text start="2772.0" dur="3.96">World Systems that there are</text><text start="2774.22" dur="4.8">technological systems that could be</text><text start="2775.96" dur="6.24">enacted that

dur="5.2">the enactment to get there takes a lot</text><text start="2786.099" dur="4.98">of work so just briefly mention the</text><text start="2788.98" dur="4.2">third attractor I'll move afterwards</text><text start="2791.079" dur="4.74">towards you know some hopeful scenarios</text><text start="2793.18" dur="5.1">that we might encounter so that you know</text><text start="2795.819" dur="5.04">people don't leave this room with a</text><text start="2798.28" dur="5.16">sense of fear and catastrophe as being</text><text start="2800.859" dur="4.861">dominant but you know like there is</text><text start="2803.44" dur="4.139">there's a real in order for us to create</text><text start="2805.72" dur="5.34">a third attractor we have to put some</text><text start="2807.579" dur="5.821">energy towards developing one and that's</text><text start="2811.06" dur="3.84">not a simple thing to do but first we</text><text start="2813.4" dur="3.36">have to understand what it is and how</text><text start="2814.9" dur="3.719">that could drive us away from those two</text><text start="2816.76" dur="4.68">attractors you know decentralized</text><text start="2818.619" dur="5.341">catastrophic capability and you know a</text><text start="2821.44" dur="5.6">centralized capacity to control on you</text><text start="2823.96" dur="3.08">know which is kind of

dur="3.36">specifically</text><text start="2841.18" dur="3.899">what I mean by the third attractor is</text><text start="2843.16" dur="3.9">literally something that is</text><text start="2845.079" dur="3.181">can prevent all the catastrophic</text><text start="2847.06" dur="3.9">possibilities where the control</text><text start="2848.26" dur="6.12">mechanisms required to do so have

dur="4.02">centralized power issues so we're</text><text start="2860.56" dur="4.62">actually defining in terms of what it</text><text start="2862.0" dur="5.16">isn't right it's not catastrophes and</text><text start="2865.18" dur="4.56">it's not that the solution of the</text><text start="2867.16" dur="4.98">catastrophes involves dystopias exactly</text><text start="2869.74" dur="4.14">what that looks like there's both how</text><text start="2872.14" dur="4.02">would we design it from scratch which is</text><text start="2873.88" dur="3.9">a nice question but it ends up being</text><text start="2876.16" dur="2.88">kind of a nonsense question because we</text><text start="2877.78" dur="4.079">don't get to design it from scratch</text><text start="2879.04" dur="4.5">there's this enactment issue of with all</text><text start="2881.859" dur="3.72">of the vested interests that the world</text><text start="2883.54" dur="4.62">currently has in play how do we actually</text><text start="2885.579" dur="4.5">get there so I can give you a few</text><text start="2888.16" dur="3.3">examples of things that give the sense</text><text start="2890.079" dur="3.361">of what can make a third attractor</text><text start="2891.46" dur="3.84">possible</text><text start="2893.44" dur="3.24">um so I'm I'm just going to mention one</text><text start="2895.3" dur="3.779">which I think you'll probably refer to</text><text start="2896.68" dur="3.96">we have a common friend in will Marshall</text><text start="2899.079" dur="4.081">um were you going to mention Planet Labs</text><text start="2900.64" dur="4.08">I wasn't but we can't okay well I mean</text><text start="2903.16" dur="3.9">so Planet Labs you know I'll let you</text><text start="2904.72" dur="4.2">talk about it but effectively I think</text><text start="2907.06" dur="4.019">it's interesting to see also that some</text><text start="2908.92" dur="4.14">of those third tractors reside in the</text><text start="2911.079" dur="4.141">domain of intelligence Plus or human</text><text start="2913.06" dur="4.44">intelligence plus technology applied to</text><text start="2915.22" dur="3.78">a new level

dur="2.881">probably is not it doesn't Define</text><text start="2923.74" dur="3.48">exactly what the thorough tractor is but</text><text start="2925.48" dur="3.599">it's sort of you know hopeful way of</text><text start="2927.22" dur="5.099">looking at technology that can</text><text start="2929.079" dur="5.101">constitute a uh an underlying let's say</text><text start="2932.319"

start to</text><text start="2939.579" dur="3.721">formulate more of those so I think we</text><text start="2942.04" dur="3.539">both agree that there needs to be a</text><text start="2943.3" dur="4.559">proliferation of these examples</text><text start="2945.579" dur="3.661">um and open and force transparency is a</text><text start="2947.859" dur="3.421">really important tool because we've got</text><text start="2949.24" dur="4.859">very weak International governance and</text><text start="2951.28" dur="4.7">law yeah so maybe you can address the</text><text start="2954.099" dur="4.621">third attractor by giving some examples</text><text start="2955.98" dur="5.92">yeah so</text><text start="2958.72" dur="5.52">Market forces like incentive by itself</text><text

dur="3.899">that can enact the law a police state</text><text start="2986.68" dur="3.72">inside of a nation-state so where we</text><text start="2988.599" dur="5.341">have Global issues

start="3018.42" dur="4.38">and so we say okay we're going to</text><text start="3020.339" dur="4.081">sanction you for that like how but the</text><text start="3022.8" dur="3.18">sanction is on a

the China Tibet type interaction</text><text start="3282.9" dur="6.9">always happened and so you you whatever</text><text start="3287.88" dur="3.54">group of people are saying we're going</text><text

the</text><text start="3350.4" dur="4.26">technology alone is not sufficient so</text><text start="3352.14" dur="5.52">one way we think about this there's a</text><text start="3354.66" dur="3.72">Anthropologist named Marvin Harris and</text><text start="3357.66" dur="3.06">he said you can think about</text><text start="3358.38" dur="4.5">civilizations as these triples of

dur="5.22">the institutions and the superstructure</text><text start="3377.04" dur="4.799">is basically the culture the values the</text><text start="3379.92" dur="4.8">identity the definition of what the good</text><text start="3381.839" dur="5.301">life what we're motivated by are he</text><text start="3384.72" dur="5.58">particularly argued that</text><text start="3387.14" dur="5.439">they are

now</text><text start="3400.26" dur="3.359">they're behaving differently right</text><text start="3401.52" dur="5.819">driving a plow is a different set of</text><text start="3403.619"

dur="4.62">there are other</text><text start="3435.18" dur="4.98">deep anthropologists and sociologists</text><text start="3437.76" dur="4.859">who say no actually and give a heap of</text><text start="3440.16" dur="3.959">examples of how cultural changes make us</text><text start="3442.619" dur="3.061">innovate in different ways aligned with</text><text start="3444.119" dur="4.021">our

start="3450.599" dur="2.941">are the deepest and then there are</text><text start="3451.92" dur="3.54">plenty of others who say no ultimately</text><text start="3453.54" dur="3.9">the economy and law is the deepest thing</text><text start="3455.46" dur="4.379">because ultimately whatever you</text><text start="3457.44" dur="3.96">incentivize financially is what the is</text><text start="3459.839" dur="3.72">the technology that will be developed if</text><text start="3461.4" dur="3.78">you change the subsidies and the taxes</text><text start="3463.559" dur="3.841">and the incentives the tech

dur="4.14">social systems and the superstructure</text><text start="3470.94" dur="3.84">culture are equally fundamental and</text><text start="3473.16" dur="2.82">inner affecting and you have to

a</text><text start="3488.579" dur="2.941">favorite one like we can just do culture</text><text start="3490.559" dur="2.401">change and everything else will</text><text start="3491.52"

them</text><text start="3497.52" dur="3.24">together and the way they intereffect</text><text start="3498.839" dur="3.78">each other is sufficient so we could</text><text start="3500.76" dur="4.62">think about if we want a future that</text><text start="3502.619" dur="4.74">avoids all these catastrophes what is</text><text start="3505.38" dur="3.84">the infrastructure have to look like</text><text start="3507.359" dur="3.541">pretty quickly we can say we can't keep</text><text start="3509.22" dur="3.24">using nature unrenewably and turning it</text><text start="3510.9"

dur="3.48">postgrowth because you can't grow it</text><text start="3516.72" dur="3.72">exponentially on a finite Planet so what</text><text start="3518.64" dur="4.08">types of Technologies would

thinking</text><text start="3710.28" dur="2.819">through what is the future of the tech</text><text start="3711.48" dur="3.78">stack look like so we share a lot of</text><text start="3713.099" dur="5.101">views and thank you for laying it out I</text><text start="3715.26" dur="5.52">hope everyone could follow with these</text><text start="3718.2" dur="3.659">um you know this way of presenting where</text><text start="3720.78" dur="2.7">we're at</text><text start="3721.859" dur="5.7">a lot of people are</text><text start="3723.48" dur="6.119">quite naturally fearful of where we're</text><text start="3727.559" dur="5.28">going in terms of the labor force</text><text start="3729.599" dur="5.22">because of AI for example and so in one</text><text start="3732.839" dur="4.141">of your talks I don't know if it was</text><text start="3734.819" dur="4.141">very recent and we shared this view</text><text start="3736.98" dur="5.4">about this by the way we talked about</text><text start="3738.96" dur="5.04">education or Educators and nurses I</text><text start="3742.38" dur="4.199">think it's a it's a good way to present</text><text start="3744.0" dur="4.859">a hopeful opportunity for us to do</text><text start="3746.579" dur="3.54">something where humans are uniquely</text><text start="3748.859" dur="3.48">designed to something different than</text><text start="3750.119" dur="4.381">machines and where efficiency is not</text><text start="3752.339" dur="4.141">what matters it's more about qualitative</text><text start="3754.5" dur="3.54">than the quantitative and our</text><text start="3756.48" dur="4.319">computational capability is not</text><text start="3758.04" dur="4.319">challenged by that yeah so I thought</text><text start="3760.799" dur="3.06">maybe it's Switching gears a little bit</text><text start="3762.359" dur="3.061">but it's giving a little bit of Hope</text><text start="3763.859" dur="4.321">again in terms of how we can address</text><text start="3765.42" dur="4.439">concretely some of these challenges that</text><text start="3768.18" dur="4.26">we're facing whether we're techno</text><text start="3769.859" dur="6.061">optimists or techno skepticists and so I</text><text start="3772.44" dur="8.1">worked with the G7 on scheme to try and</text><text start="3775.92" dur="8.159">Infuse into National Security in the G8</text><text start="3780.54" dur="5.579">countries a concept of benevolent Ai and</text><text start="3784.079" dur="3.78">we were just studying with 80 scientists</text><text start="3786.119" dur="3.421">from all over the world how we could</text><text start="3787.859" dur="4.5">potentially put that into motion and</text><text start="3789.54" dur="6.5">start to educate government bodies and</text><text start="3792.359" dur="6.121">leaders and the main failure point was</text><text start="3796.04" dur="5.2">purely geopolitical</text><text start="3798.48" dur="4.44">so the arms race and AI just made it so</text><text start="3801.24" dur="4.379">that it made every single suggestion</text><text start="3802.92" dur="4.98">stalemate so we have to address it on a</text><text start="3805.619" dur="5.401">population level and also in terms of</text><text start="3807.9" dur="5.28">how in terms of society we adapt to the</text><text start="3811.02" dur="4.319">change that's coming towards us so we've</text><text start="3813.18" dur="4.679">adapted to Bringing cars in our into our</text><text start="3815.339" dur="4.621">life arguably and perfectly</text><text start="3817.859" dur="4.561">um we've adapted to many changes in our</text><text start="3819.96" dur="5.399">society in terms of health care and</text><text start="3822.42" dur="4.8">pandemics and how we travel and etc etc</text><text start="3825.359" dur="3.901">give us a little</text><text start="3827.22" dur="4.68">um you know I I share this view with you</text><text start="3829.26" dur="4.44">by the way how you think Educators and</text><text start="3831.9" dur="4.62">nurses could become a little bit of a</text><text start="3833.7" dur="4.879">new orientation for mankind as AI steps</text><text start="3836.52" dur="2.059">in</text><text start="3842.04" dur="6.66">so the topic of technological automation</text><text start="3845.4" dur="6.06">creating a jobs issue</text><text start="3848.7" dur="6.599">um there's a couple perspectives one</text><text start="3851.46" dur="5.639">primary perspective is uh technological</text><text start="3855.299" dur="3.421">automation will obsolete certain jobs</text><text start="3857.099" dur="3.181">but it'll create new jobs it's always</text><text start="3858.72" dur="3.3">been the case we don't have elevator</text><text start="3860.28" dur="3.96">operators anymore but there's plenty of</text><text start="3862.02" dur="4.339">new jobs and then there's the other</text><text start="3864.24" dur="4.619">perspective no actually</text><text start="3866.359" dur="4.121">Advanced Robotics and AI are different</text><text start="3868.859" dur="3.301">in kinds in some of the earlier</text><text start="3870.48" dur="3.9">Industrial Technologies and they're</text><text start="3872.16" dur="3.78">different in speed that as new jobs are</text><text start="3874.38" dur="3.86">created they will still be able to beat</text><text start="3875.94" dur="6.3">humans at doing it for Market purposes</text><text start="3878.24" dur="7.119">which I think is much more true</text><text start="3882.24" dur="7.26">um so if you take an AI</text><text start="3885.359" dur="6.661">like uh Google's AI you take alphago you</text><text start="3889.5" dur="4.02">can train it on chess and how to beat</text><text start="3892.02" dur="3.0">everybody in chess you can train it on</text><text start="3893.52" dur="2.88">go and how to beat everybody at go you</text><text start="3895.02" dur="3.12">can train it on Starcraft and how to</text><text start="3896.4" dur="3.84">beat everybody at Starcraft it can gain</text><text start="3898.14" dur="4.8">the capacity very quickly to beat humans</text><text start="3900.24" dur="6.18">at any finitely definable game</text><text start="3902.94" dur="6.24">and so AI is different in kind</text><text start="3906.42" dur="4.62">than other previous Technologies it's</text><text start="3909.18" dur="3.36">more like the difference between us and</text><text start="3911.04" dur="3.9">all the other animals with our ability</text><text start="3912.54" dur="4.259">to innovate you know creating recursive</text><text start="3914.94" dur="3.96">technology on technology that allowed us</text><text start="3916.799" dur="3.961">to become apex predators in every</text><text start="3918.9" dur="4.919">environment and then more than that the</text><text start="3920.76" dur="5.22">AI is kind of like that jump again and</text><text start="3923.819" dur="3.661">so it does portend</text><text start="3925.98" dur="4.56">um</text><text start="3927.48" dur="6.119">uh a break of capitalism and Market</text><text start="3930.54" dur="6.9">structures as we know it and that most</text><text start="3933.599" dur="6.841">of not just labor but most of the jobs</text><text start="3937.44" dur="5.04">that we currently have and even the new</text><text start="3940.44" dur="4.02">jobs that emerge in the niches that it</text><text start="3942.48" dur="4.079">creates it's better at than we are</text><text start="3944.46" dur="4.139">that sounds pretty terrible if you keep</text><text start="3946.559" dur="3.661">the existing political economy where</text><text start="3948.599" dur="3.361">people need the jobs but one of the main</text><text start="3950.22" dur="3.42">reason we created a system where the</text><text start="3951.96" dur="4.44">people need the jobs is because the jobs</text><text start="3953.64" dur="4.979">needed the people to do them and if you</text><text start="3956.4" dur="4.08">to make a civilization run well if you</text><text start="3958.619" dur="3.541">had to get the people to do the jobs and</text><text start="3960.48" dur="3.42">a market seemed like a better answer</text><text start="3962.16" dur="4.139">than the state forcing the people to do</text><text start="3963.9" dur="3.36">it so let's let the market force people</text><text start="3966.299" dur="2.401">to do it and they can kind of</text><text start="3967.26" dur="4.02">self-organize and</text><text start="3968.7" dur="4.5">but as soon as the jobs don't need the</text><text start="3971.28" dur="4.079">people to do them anymore you can also</text><text start="3973.2" dur="3.659">start thinking about economies where the</text><text start="3975.359" dur="2.521">people don't need the jobs which is why</text><text start="3976.859" dur="2.581">now a lot of people are thinking about</text><text start="3977.88" dur="4.5">Universal basic income and like</text><text start="3979.44" dur="5.82">different ways of thinking about that</text><text start="3982.38" dur="4.62">um there there's early naive thoughts on</text><text start="3985.26" dur="4.26">universal basic income of course it's</text><text start="3987.0" dur="3.72">the beginning of thinking about it but</text><text start="3989.52" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="3990.72" dur="6.899">there's a really deep question which is</text><text start="3993.66" dur="6.24">what is the role of humans in a world of</text><text start="3997.619" dur="4.141">advanced Robotics and AI</text><text start="3999.9" dur="3.36">because the advanced Robotics and AI</text><text start="4001.76" dur="2.819">will be better than us at most of the</text><text start="4003.26" dur="3.359">things that we're used to being good at</text><text start="4004.579" dur="5.04">so what is the role of humans in that</text><text start="4006.619" dur="4.68">world what are we still uniquely good at</text><text start="4009.619" dur="4.861">and then what is also intrinsically</text><text start="4011.299" dur="5.76">fulfilling and meaningful and there</text><text start="4014.48" dur="5.22">becomes a steep question of what</text><text start="4017.059" dur="4.201">what does education become in a</text><text start="4019.7" dur="3.0">post-technological automation world</text><text start="4021.26" dur="4.5">where you're not Preparing People for</text><text start="4022.7" dur="4.619">the workforce in the same way what is</text><text start="4025.76" dur="3.72">the role of education and human</text><text start="4027.319" dur="4.381">development but obviously to answer that</text><text start="4029.48" dur="4.02">you have to say not just education but</text><text start="4031.7" dur="3.3">and obviously there's the economics</text><text start="4033.5" dur="4.02">component how do we do resource</text><text start="4035.0" dur="3.78">allocation and access in that world but</text><text start="4037.52" dur="2.7">there's a really deep civilizational</text><text start="4038.78" dur="3.96">question of what is the role of human</text><text start="4040.22" dur="6.18">life and if we for a moment avoid the</text><text start="4042.74" dur="6.18">topic of sentient AI which is a whole</text><text start="4046.4" dur="6.12">theoretically difficult question and we</text><text start="4048.92" dur="5.399">just talk about functional AI meaning AI</text><text start="4052.52" dur="3.599">that we're not saying there's something</text><text start="4054.319" dur="3.3">that it is like to be it we're simply</text><text start="4056.119" dur="3.5">saying it's very good at figuring out</text><text start="4057.619" dur="5.761">how to do stuff</text><text start="4059.619" dur="5.92">then right away the the key what is</text><text start="4063.38" dur="6.479">uniquely different about humans and it</text><text start="4065.539" dur="6.0">is sentience is the capacity to actually</text><text start="4069.859" dur="4.321">have there be something that it is like</text><text start="4071.539" dur="4.26">to be you at all this is subjective</text><text start="4074.18" dur="3.72">experience and then intersubjective</text><text start="4075.799" dur="5.701">connective capacity and what's</text><text start="4077.9" dur="6.0">interesting is things related to</text><text start="4081.5" dur="4.619">sentience are what is is where our</text><text start="4083.9" dur="3.899">intrinsic motive if we're not</text><text start="4086.119" dur="4.2">being behaviorally controlled by</text><text start="4087.799" dur="5.54">extrinsic motive I.E being paid to do a</text><text start="4090.319" dur="5.52">thing or external deterrence and so</text><text start="4093.339" dur="5.801">mostly you have to pay people to do</text><text start="4095.839" dur="4.741">they don't want to do right and if the</text><text start="4099.14" dur="3.84"> that people don't want to do is</text><text start="4100.58" dur="4.619">increasingly getting automated can you</text><text start="4102.98" dur="4.62">then have a world where largely what</text><text start="4105.199" dur="5.761">humans are spending time doing also more</text><text start="4107.6" dur="5.04">deeply uh coincides with what they have</text><text start="4110.96" dur="3.359">the deepest intrinsic motive to do</text><text start="4112.64" dur="3.3">particularly if you then have a</text><text start="4114.319" dur="3.601">developmental system and developmental</text><text start="4115.94" dur="4.2">Society oriented to find out what the</text><text start="4117.92" dur="3.779">unique human motivations and capacities</text><text start="4120.14" dur="3.78">of each person are and develop them in</text><text start="4121.699" dur="4.02">light of that and so not only does AI</text><text start="4123.92" dur="4.08">portend something in terms of the</text><text start="4125.719" dur="5.04">obsolescence of humans for lots of Labor</text><text start="4128.0" dur="5.52">roles and repetitive things one of the</text><text start="4130.759" dur="3.721">things uh Tomas was probably referencing</text><text start="4133.52" dur="3.38">was</text><text start="4134.48" dur="5.64">the topic of</text><text start="4136.9" dur="6.879">AI in human

able to model your micro</text><text start="4153.38" dur="7.08">Expressions to see how you're learning</text><text start="4156.259" dur="6.121">it can also uh have undue influence in a</text><text start="4160.46" dur="4.259">way that no cult leader has dreamed of</text><text start="4162.38" dur="5.04">right in terms of asymmetries of power</text><text start="4164.719" dur="3.841">of influence so so who controls that and</text><text start="4167.42" dur="2.819">how do they control that these actually</text><text start="4168.56" dur="3.6">become the cultural questions the</text><text start="4170.239" dur="3.901">theoretical philosophic questions that</text><text start="4172.16" dur="3.9">are so fundamental if you can</text><text start="4174.14" dur="3.539">genetically engineer humans and have</text><text start="4176.06" dur="4.44">designer babies don't we all want to be</text><text start="4177.679" dur="4.741">like tall and beautiful and uh thin and</text><text start="4180.5" dur="3.719">is that actually the right idea when you</text><text start="4182.42" dur="4.02">as soon as you have the ability to</text><text start="4184.219" dur="3.96">actually design intelligent machines and</text><text start="4186.44" dur="3.72">design self-replicating machines and</text><text start="4188.179" dur="5.341">change biology the philosophic questions</text><text start="4190.16" dur="5.1">of what is good and desirable becomes so</text><text start="4193.52" dur="3.56">fundamental because so much becomes</text><text start="4195.26" dur="5.12">possible right</text><text start="4197.08" dur="6.52">but if you do it right imagine</text><text start="4200.38" dur="5.28">everybody's heard about deep fakes</text><text start="4203.6" dur="4.98">the ability to</text><text start="4205.66" dur="4.6">train an AI you can make basically</text><text start="4208.58" dur="3.84">pictures that aren't real faces that</text><text start="4210.26" dur="4.68">aren't real from AI images that look</text><text start="4212.42" dur="4.5">totally real you can also make a video</text><text start="4214.94" dur="3.779">of me speaking where it looks exactly</text><text start="4216.92" dur="3.54">like me sounds like me but it's totally</text><text start="4218.719" dur="4.261">I generated it's not real that</text><text start="4220.46" dur="4.14">technology already exists it's not that</text><text start="4222.98" dur="4.259">good some people have made deep fakes of</text><text start="4224.6" dur="5.7">me that are audio that sound like me</text><text start="4227.239" dur="5.341">um but the Deep fake videos are</text><text start="4230.3" dur="4.62">currently about three years away from</text><text start="4232.58" dur="6.9">being Turing test passing meaning you</text><text start="4234.92" dur="6.18">can watch a video of uh Obama or Bernie</text><text start="4239.48" dur="3.54">Sanders or whoever say something and</text><text start="4241.1" dur="3.66">have no idea if it was real or not and</text><text start="4243.02" dur="3.6">you won't have the human capacity to</text><text start="4244.76" dur="3.479">tell if it's real or fake you can</text><text start="4246.62" dur="4.26">imagine what that does to our ability</text><text start="4248.239" dur="5.161">for eclectic Collective sense making</text><text start="4250.88" dur="4.5">but that same deep fake capacity can be</text><text start="4253.4" dur="4.02">positively purposed because what that</text><text start="4255.38" dur="3.779">means is it's trained on the semantic</text><text start="4257.42" dur="4.319">patterns and the vocal patterns enough</text><text start="4259.159" dur="5.04">to be able to generate novel answers</text><text start="4261.739" dur="3.901">like a chat bot but where you can't tell</text><text start="4264.199" dur="2.941">that it's not real</text><text start="4265.64" dur="4.019">so now imagine an educational</text><text start="4267.14" dur="4.26">environment where you train that same AI</text><text start="4269.659" dur="4.321">this is large language models as the</text><text start="4271.4" dur="4.56">type of AI say you train it on all the</text><text start="4273.98" dur="4.08">writings of Thomas Jefferson or all the</text><text start="4275.96" dur="3.719">writings of Socrates Socrates through</text><text start="4278.06" dur="5.04">Plato or whatever in writings about them</text><text start="4279.679" dur="7.141">such that I can go into a metaverse</text><text start="4283.1" dur="6.3">environment and say I want to pull up</text><text start="4286.82" dur="3.66">Einstein and Von Neumann and kerr girdle</text><text start="4289.4" dur="4.14">and be able to have a talk with him</text><text start="4290.48" dur="5.46">about formal logic and not only</text><text start="4293.54" dur="3.9">can and they can it can seem like I'm</text><text start="4295.94" dur="3.36">actually having a conversation with them</text><text start="4297.44" dur="5.46">where they're sharing differing views</text><text start="4299.3" dur="4.439">based on their actual views writing Etc</text><text start="4302.9" dur="2.88">um</text><text start="4303.739" dur="4.261">but I could also just have an avatar</text><text start="4305.78" dur="4.2">that is like the the voice of chemistry</text><text start="4308.0" dur="4.38">that is the holistic knowledge of all</text><text start="4309.98" dur="5.64">chemistry that no human could be</text><text start="4312.38" dur="5.94">and yet all of them are the ai's best</text><text start="4315.62" dur="5.16">attempt to model what that person</text><text start="4318.32" dur="4.02">would do in terms of semantic coherency</text><text start="4320.78" dur="3.959">with what they did and said in the past</text><text start="4322.34" dur="4.379">so now imagine a future where every kid</text><text start="4324.739" dur="4.081">has access to be able to study with</text><text start="4326.719" dur="4.381">Einstein and Gandhi and Socrates and Von</text><text start="4328.82" dur="4.74">Neumann and whatever directly where</text><text start="4331.1" dur="5.119">those AIS can model our theory of mind</text><text start="4333.56" dur="4.8">and titrate the learning directly to us</text><text start="4336.219" dur="5.261">associated with our learning Dynamics</text><text start="4338.36" dur="5.46">but then also because the jobs have</text><text start="4341.48" dur="3.719">largely been automated what humans spend</text><text start="4343.82" dur="3.66">way more of their time with is things</text><text start="4345.199" dur="3.901">like being Educators and being nurses</text><text start="4347.48" dur="3.6">and being musicians and the things that</text><text start="4349.1" dur="4.02">have kind of high connectivity value</text><text start="4351.08" dur="4.139">because those are the things that the</text><text start="4353.12" dur="4.68">machines don't do as well as the actual</text><text start="4355.219" dur="4.801">sense of shared interiority so now</text><text start="4357.8" dur="3.78">imagine that we have way more teachers</text><text start="4360.02" dur="3.96">per capita that are way more well</text><text start="4361.58" dur="5.04">trained so all the teachers are</text><text start="4363.98" dur="4.98">you know PhD level trained</text><text start="4366.62" dur="5.039">there's one of them per 10 kids as</text><text start="4368.96" dur="3.98">opposed to one per 30 and now I get out</text><text start="4371.659" dur="3.961">of my</text><text start="4372.94" dur="6.46">AI environment where I was just studying</text><text start="4375.62" dur="6.78">physics with Einstein and my tutor asks</text><text start="4379.4" dur="4.98">me a question like what do you think was</text><text start="4382.4" dur="3.779">different about what the AI Einstein</text><text start="4384.38" dur="3.839">said than what in actual Einstein live</text><text start="4386.179" dur="3.361">today might have said so then helping us</text><text start="4388.219" dur="2.94">to try to understand the difference</text><text start="4389.54" dur="3.06">between human intelligence and</text><text start="4391.159" dur="3.481">artificial intelligence and what it</text><text start="4392.6" dur="3.72">means to be sentient and what effect</text><text start="4394.64" dur="4.079">does Consciousness have on intelligence</text><text start="4396.32" dur="5.64">so not only are they getting that level</text><text start="4398.719" dur="5.221">of educational access but they're that</text><text start="4401.96" dur="3.719">the AI can do but the differential of</text><text start="4403.94" dur="3.9">what is unique about human intelligence</text><text start="4405.679" dur="4.381">and artificial intelligence so this is</text><text start="4407.84" dur="3.66">one of a million examples we can give of</text><text start="4410.06" dur="3.96">how those Technologies could do</text><text start="4411.5" dur="4.86">mind-bendingly amazing things I'll say</text><text start="4414.02" dur="4.26">one quick thing about this is um there</text><text start="4416.36" dur="4.859">is a</text><text start="4418.28" dur="4.8">there's a study done on Super Genius of</text><text start="4421.219" dur="4.02">the past or polymaths people who</text><text start="4423.08" dur="4.159">advanced many different fields beyond</text><text start="4425.239" dur="5.881">what the specialists in those fields did</text><text start="4427.239" dur="6.161">and uh was there anything that the Great</text><text start="4431.12" dur="3.84">polymaths had in common and the single</text><text start="4433.4" dur="3.24">thing that stood out the most was that</text><text start="4434.96" dur="3.18">they were all the result of aristocratic</text><text start="4436.64" dur="4.019">tutoring</text><text start="4438.14" dur="5.039">and this was actually a very taboo topic</text><text start="4440.659" dur="5.58">because when we ended feudalism and</text><text start="4443.179" dur="5.641">tried to create Democratic states uh the</text><text start="4446.239" dur="5.101">idea like if you if you think of</text><text start="4448.82" dur="4.379">meditations by Marcus Aurelius Marcus</text><text start="4451.34" dur="3.78">Aurelius spends the entire first chapter</text><text start="4453.199" dur="3.54">just thanking all of his tutors but when</text><text start="4455.12" dur="4.079">you're being raised to be the emperor of</text><text start="4456.739" dur="4.381">Rome the best mathematician the best</text><text start="4459.199" dur="3.96">poet the best grammarian the best</text><text start="4461.12" dur="3.3">historian literally in all of Rome are</text><text start="4463.159" dur="3.961">your private tutors</text><text start="4464.42" dur="4.14">and you can't learn to think like a</text><text start="4467.12" dur="3.3">mathematical genius from someone who</text><text start="4468.56" dur="3.78">wasn't a mathematical genius so your</text><text start="4470.42" dur="3.66">average math teacher cannot teach you to</text><text start="4472.34" dur="4.68">think like that because they don't think</text><text start="4474.08" dur="5.04">like that and yet that's how do you make</text><text start="4477.02" dur="4.02">that accessible to everyone you don't so</text><text start="4479.12" dur="3.72">the aristocratic tutoring in the past</text><text start="4481.04" dur="3.96">was a nice patronage job for the</text><text start="4482.84" dur="4.92">smartest people but it was also so</text><text start="4485.0" dur="5.52">radically unequal but it's what created</text><text start="4487.76" dur="6.36">the best Minds so could that possibly be</text><text start="4490.52" dur="5.82">made popular well we can see in a third</text><text start="4494.12" dur="4.32">attractor kind of world the application</text><text start="4496.34" dur="3.48">of these Technologies where you could</text><text start="4498.44" dur="4.56">actually have better tutoring than</text><text start="4499.82" dur="5.7">Marcus Aurelius had for everybody</text><text start="4503.0" dur="4.14">um you know et cetera et cetera now for</text><text start="4505.52" dur="5.46">each of these wonderful scenarios are</text><text start="4507.14" dur="7.32">like a million ways it goes wrong and so</text><text start="4510.98" dur="4.8">um how how we Steward that properly is</text><text start="4514.46" dur="2.58">the key defining thing over the next</text><text start="4515.78" dur="4.1">while</text><text start="4517.04" dur="2.84">thank you Daniel</text><text start="4520.82"
