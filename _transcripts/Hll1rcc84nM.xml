dur="7.04">I can so without further Ado please</text><text start="188.7" dur="4.88">welcome to the feedback loop Zach Stein</text><text start="195.98" dur="5.08">so that we can get kind of a big picture</text><text start="198.72" dur="3.599">of of your work and the things that you</text><text start="201.06" dur="2.819">do is maybe to start with the</text><text start="202.319" dur="4.321">consilience project</text><text start="203.879" dur="4.981">and what motivated you and Daniel</text><text start="206.64" dur="4.819">schmachtenberger to put together that</text><text start="208.86" dur="2.599">organization</text><text start="211.8" dur="6.659">so the consilience project was born in</text><text start="215.819" dur="4.5">the wake of the many crises that</text><text start="218.459" dur="3.78">followed from covid</text><text start="220.319" dur="3.84">sense we</text><text start="222.239" dur="3.08">had brought together a team of</text><text start="224.159" dur="3.0">researchers</text><text start="225.319" dur="4.301">to kind of look at the information</text><text start="227.159" dur="5.341">ecology try to figure out what was going</text><text start="229.62" dur="4.74">on and this led us to a set of important</text><text start="232.5" dur="3.18">Reflections on the sense making crisis</text><text start="234.36" dur="5.459">which had already been</text><text start="235.68" dur="7.199">named by uh Daniel and others</text><text start="239.819" dur="5.34">um and so we began just a systematic</text><text start="242.879" dur="3.661">approach to trying to articulate the</text><text start="245.159" dur="2.64">questions that were most basic to</text><text start="246.54" dur="3.44">understanding the nature of the sense</text><text start="247.799" dur="5.94">making crisis and the threat</text><text start="249.98" dur="6.7">that the total confusion</text><text start="253.739" dur="4.62">of the media ecosystem has generated the</text><text start="256.68" dur="4.559">individual and the institutional kind of</text><text start="258.359" dur="5.161">bureaucratic decision-making level</text><text start="261.239" dur="4.621">um so that was the impetus and in a</text><text start="263.52" dur="5.76">sense it the prior impetus was to begin</text><text start="265.86" dur="6.059">a conversation about existential and</text><text start="269.28" dur="4.74">catastrophic risk and specifically the</text><text start="271.919" dur="3.84">what we now would call The Meta crisis</text><text start="274.02" dur="4.32">but this overarching</text><text start="275.759" dur="5.101">threat to the nature of civilization and</text><text start="278.34" dur="3.84">possibly the continuity of life itself</text><text start="280.86" dur="4.14">and we realized that we couldn&apos;t really</text><text start="282.18" dur="5.04">even have that conversation in a public</text><text start="285.0" dur="4.32">forum because of the state of sense</text><text start="287.22" dur="3.9">making itself so the first move to even</text><text start="289.32" dur="3.18">begin a conversation about the future of</text><text start="291.12" dur="4.68">civilization</text><text start="292.5" dur="6.3">is to make a place where that</text><text start="295.8" dur="5.16">conversation is actually possible and</text><text start="298.8" dur="5.28">at first we were attempting to</text><text start="300.96" dur="4.679">address the media itself and then</text><text start="304.08" dur="3.059">realized</text><text start="305.639" dur="3.661">that a better approach would be to</text><text start="307.139" dur="5.181">reflect on the nature of the</text><text start="309.3" dur="3.02">sense-making crisis</text><text start="312.36" dur="3.779">and</text><text start="313.86" dur="3.6">and so that was the The Hope and now</text><text start="316.139" dur="3.12">we&apos;re moving the work to a place where</text><text start="317.46" dur="2.94">we&apos;re going to begin to to speak of the</text><text start="319.259" dur="3.121">meta crisis</text><text start="320.4" dur="4.139">could you talk a little bit about how</text><text start="322.38" dur="3.9">the information ecology and The Meta</text><text start="324.539" dur="5.16">crisis that we find ourselves in came</text><text start="326.28" dur="4.56">about what was the I guess Arc that</text><text start="329.699" dur="3.541">brought us to this point was it</text><text start="330.84" dur="5.28">something that was pretty</text><text start="333.24" dur="5.58">um dormant for for most of civilization</text><text start="336.12" dur="3.84">and then God really exacerbated because</text><text start="338.82" dur="2.52">of</text><text start="339.96" dur="3.42">technology because of the internet</text><text start="341.34" dur="4.5">because of social media like was there</text><text start="343.38" dur="5.28">any real ramp up points or Milestones</text><text start="345.84" dur="4.98">that really drove this into the place of</text><text start="348.66" dur="3.979">disorientation that we are now</text><text start="350.82" dur="4.56">kind of depends who you ask</text><text start="352.639" dur="4.9">you know not not in a relativistic sense</text><text start="355.38" dur="5.34">but in the sense that it&apos;s a truly</text><text start="357.539" dur="4.861">interdisciplinary question that you know</text><text start="360.72" dur="3.78">one of the ways to think about the meta</text><text start="362.4" dur="5.639">crisis is as a</text><text start="364.5" dur="5.52">kind of a causal or Nexus causal type of</text><text start="368.039" dur="5.401">phenomenon where you&apos;re looking at many</text><text start="370.02" dur="4.86">many complex causal Pathways into this</text><text start="373.44" dur="3.06">phenomenon which is in a sense of</text><text start="374.88" dur="3.42">emergent phenomenon from the many</text><text start="376.5" dur="3.9">subsidiary crises and the generator</text><text start="378.3" dur="6.0">functions of those</text><text start="380.4" dur="7.62">so there really are very truly distinct</text><text start="384.3" dur="5.519">and and comparably adequate perspectives</text><text start="388.02" dur="5.76">on the issue one one perspective would</text><text start="389.819" dur="6.6">be yes this is primarily about</text><text start="393.78" dur="4.859">exponential technology</text><text start="396.419" dur="3.361">brought into the context of societies</text><text start="398.639" dur="2.641">that are kind of operating the way</text><text start="399.78" dur="2.699">societies always have</text><text start="401.28" dur="2.4">and then you bring exponential</text><text start="402.479" dur="3.181">technology and you&apos;ve changed everything</text><text start="403.68" dur="3.359">uh</text><text start="405.66" dur="4.319">there&apos;s also one that this is</text><text start="407.039" dur="5.461">fundamentally more about Technologies of</text><text start="409.979" dur="5.34">media which is this Technologies of</text><text start="412.5" dur="5.66">communication so there&apos;s a clue and ask</text><text start="415.319" dur="5.82">type characterization of this</text><text start="418.16" dur="4.84">which sees it as essentially The Meta</text><text start="421.139" dur="4.62">crisis being some kind of inevitability</text><text start="423.0" dur="4.259">of the digital</text><text start="425.759" dur="3.601">um</text><text start="427.259" dur="3.78">and then there are other ones and I&apos;m a</text><text start="429.36" dur="4.82">philosopher of education so I see this</text><text start="431.039" dur="5.841">as a compounding educational crisis</text><text start="434.18" dur="4.54">which is to say a</text><text start="436.88" dur="2.92">self-amplifying educational crisis</text><text start="438.72" dur="2.699">because the problem with educational</text><text start="439.8" dur="3.899">crises is that</text><text start="441.419" dur="4.021">they degrade the overall capacity to</text><text start="443.699" dur="4.261">recognize the ability that there is an</text><text start="445.44" dur="3.74">educational crisis right so that there</text><text start="447.96" dur="3.48">are some crises that have</text><text start="449.18" dur="5.019">self-amplifying properties in the</text><text start="451.44" dur="5.159">educational crisis has this so</text><text start="454.199" dur="4.201">if we set in certain errors in the</text><text start="456.599" dur="4.44">structure of the way we did education</text><text start="458.4" dur="5.04">let&apos;s say post-war</text><text start="461.039" dur="3.72">those would begin to play out and then</text><text start="463.44" dur="3.36">they would self-amplify to the point</text><text start="464.759" dur="4.56">where you&apos;d have a profound society-wide</text><text start="466.8" dur="4.38">education crisis which I believe we have</text><text start="469.319" dur="4.5">in a context when more money is being</text><text start="471.18" dur="5.4">thrown into into educational reform than</text><text start="473.819" dur="5.16">ever so you get the kind of diminishing</text><text start="476.58" dur="3.78">returns on investment and complexity uh</text><text start="478.979" dur="3.78">which is a characteristic of</text><text start="480.36" dur="4.98">civilizational collapse more broadly</text><text start="482.759" dur="5.461">so those are three there&apos;s other views</text><text start="485.34" dur="9.38">um you know economic it&apos;s hard not to</text><text start="488.22" dur="9.599">see this as a climax of a uh untenable</text><text start="494.72" dur="5.74">economic an untenable fundamental</text><text start="497.819" dur="6.6">economic Paradigm which is to say</text><text start="500.46" dur="6.54">infinite extraction of a finite resource</text><text start="504.419" dur="5.46">right and we can do that there&apos;s a whole</text><text start="507.0" dur="5.099">kind of rabbit hole down seeing this as</text><text start="509.879" dur="4.981">a result of kind of economic generator</text><text start="512.099" dur="4.44">functions if you will yeah and that&apos;s</text><text start="514.86" dur="4.02">the problem with the meta crisis is that</text><text start="516.539" dur="7.261">there&apos;s not one route there&apos;s actually</text><text start="518.88" dur="6.54">many many routes uh many inter-animating</text><text start="523.8" dur="4.08">crises</text><text start="525.42" dur="5.34">which means that mitigation of such a</text><text start="527.88" dur="6.3">crisis such a meta crisis requires a</text><text start="530.76" dur="5.1">concerted effort of many very distinct</text><text start="534.18" dur="3.36">groups</text><text start="535.86" dur="4.32">I was going to say is this why you look</text><text start="537.54" dur="6.14">to education because it in a way it&apos;s</text><text start="540.18" dur="5.82">almost a way to train the wisdom or the</text><text start="543.68" dur="4.839">understanding of complex thinking or</text><text start="546.0" dur="4.74">complex science to understand how these</text><text start="548.519" dur="3.301">things coalesce I mean if you look for</text><text start="550.74" dur="4.08">the root</text><text start="551.82" dur="5.459">education is rude all of the other</text><text start="554.82" dur="4.019">crises are fundamentally crises of human</text><text start="557.279" dur="3.661">decision making</text><text start="558.839" dur="4.62">the root of human decision making is how</text><text start="560.94" dur="6.12">that human was educated and so there&apos;s a</text><text start="563.459" dur="6.661">fundamental Source problem of the type</text><text start="567.06" dur="5.839">of mind that is being created and</text><text start="570.12" dur="6.839">domesticated and made common within our</text><text start="572.899" dur="5.62">civilization is a mind that has created</text><text start="576.959" dur="3.621">patterns and processes within the</text><text start="578.519" dur="4.741">civilization that are driving it towards</text><text start="580.58" dur="4.42">self-determination so that there&apos;s a</text><text start="583.26" dur="5.42">there&apos;s a fundamental problem in</text><text start="585.0" dur="7.26">educational Paradigm if it&apos;s creating</text><text start="588.68" dur="7.599">psychological and skill sets and</text><text start="592.26" dur="6.24">personality types that are not allowing</text><text start="596.279" dur="5.641">the civilization to to transform in ways</text><text start="598.5" dur="6.42">that have it maintain its viability</text><text start="601.92" dur="4.38">so it&apos;s a root it&apos;s a root of the many</text><text start="604.92" dur="4.2">crises</text><text start="606.3" dur="6.599">um and uh it&apos;s what&apos;s so funny about you</text><text start="609.12" dur="5.159">know Educators know this yeah uh</text><text start="612.899" dur="2.821">um and there&apos;s something interesting</text><text start="614.279" dur="2.881">about education as I Define I&apos;m not</text><text start="615.72" dur="3.54">talking about schools and so I think</text><text start="617.16" dur="4.02">that&apos;s the the thing that maybe people</text><text start="619.26" dur="3.06">would hesitate to take this view is</text><text start="621.18" dur="3.18">because they have all the things you</text><text start="622.32" dur="4.74">know there&apos;s way more than just failure</text><text start="624.36" dur="4.62">of the schools uh and in fact maybe the</text><text start="627.06" dur="4.44">schools aren&apos;t failing but the point is</text><text start="628.98" dur="4.02">that the education of a society as I</text><text start="631.5" dur="3.42">Define it is one of the broadest social</text><text start="633.0" dur="4.019">functions of society that&apos;s performed by</text><text start="634.92" dur="3.66">almost every institution but</text><text start="637.019" dur="4.641">specifically the institutions of the</text><text start="638.58" dur="4.62">family of school and of law</text><text start="641.66" dur="3.6">and</text><text start="643.2" dur="5.28">of course media</text><text start="645.26" dur="4.9">uh being the other obvious one so the</text><text start="648.48" dur="3.859">idea here is that it&apos;s not failure of</text><text start="650.16" dur="5.04">school it&apos;s actually</text><text start="652.339" dur="5.801">inadequacy of total set of educational</text><text start="655.2" dur="6.0">institutions that are responsible for</text><text start="658.14" dur="4.86">the auto poetic reproduction of the</text><text start="661.2" dur="4.199">skills necessary to maintain the</text><text start="663.0" dur="3.72">civilization and often when</text><text start="665.399" dur="3.721">civilizations</text><text start="666.72" dur="4.92">or any social system is in crisis the</text><text start="669.12" dur="3.36">education system then has to change its</text><text start="671.64" dur="2.699">nature</text><text start="672.48" dur="3.96">so that it doesn&apos;t just simply reproduce</text><text start="674.339" dur="4.5">the same skill set into</text><text start="676.44" dur="5.1">a place where they&apos;re not relevant but</text><text start="678.839" dur="5.341">can make new skills and so we&apos;re in that</text><text start="681.54" dur="4.44">kind of Crisis where for about 30 years</text><text start="684.18"

is I want to agree with this</text><text start="1109.58" dur="4.08">idea that you&apos;re pushing towards maybe</text><text start="1111.02" dur="5.539">this more decentralized idea and I often</text><text start="1113.66" dur="4.98">feel very strongly that the more we</text><text start="1116.559" dur="4.961">individualize the instruction to the</text><text start="1118.64"

the fact that people are</text><text start="1139.28" dur="3.96">being educated through social media</text><text start="1141.5" dur="3.66">rather than through something that kind</text><text start="1143.24" dur="4.559">of gives them a real sense making</text><text start="1145.16" dur="4.32">apparatus or gives them some curated</text><text start="1147.799" dur="4.74">curriculum</text><text

dur="5.16">right now because we have created</text><text start="1164.24" dur="5.64">artificial context where we have made</text><text start="1166.16" dur="5.58">teacherly Authority only

dur="2.479">authority</text><text start="1175.28" dur="4.74">at all</text><text start="1176.559" dur="6.761">uh and so that&apos;s that&apos;s key so that&apos;s a</text><text start="1180.02" dur="5.34">very real concern in fact the the the</text><text start="1183.32" dur="3.9">kind of like decentralization of</text><text start="1185.36" dur="3.48">knowledge production processes can work</text><text start="1187.22" dur="3.12">against the quality of the knowledge</text><text start="1188.84" dur="3.36">that&apos;s propagated</text><text start="1190.34" dur="4.14">um so it&apos;s

start="1198.44" dur="3.2">this a is this a value systems issue</text><text start="1200.419" dur="3.721">that&apos;s maybe</text><text start="1201.64" dur="4.779">arising a bit from social media as well</text><text start="1204.14" dur="5.34">because when I think of the</text><text start="1206.419" dur="6.241">way that you know humans are social Apes</text><text start="1209.48" dur="5.28">kind of learn what to prioritize if I</text><text start="1212.66" dur="4.56">was born into this world and I was to</text><text start="1214.76" dur="5.46">look at something like social media and</text><text

by Society I would not</text><text start="1224.6" dur="4.56">see something that makes me think that</text><text start="1226.039" dur="6.301">like being a independent free thinker</text><text start="1229.16" dur="4.86">and like trying to stay out of the chaos</text><text start="1232.34" dur="3.54">is good I would actually think that</text><text start="1234.02" dur="4.74">wading into the chaos being</text><text start="1235.88" dur="5.159">controversial becoming and you know an</text><text start="1238.76" dur="4.44">influencer rather than like a thinker is</text><text start="1241.039" dur="4.581">the key thing here so I mean I can&apos;t</text><text start="1243.2" dur="5.04">help but think part of the</text><text start="1245.62" dur="5.02">disorientation or the the failures in</text><text start="1248.24" dur="5.04">education is part of us just not feeling</text><text start="1250.64" dur="6.779">motivated to be educated in that way or</text><text start="1253.28"

dur="5.88">distinctions between it entirely</text><text start="1392.12" dur="6.24">right so we have to make educational</text><text start="1395.36" dur="5.36">intervention that is more

uh</text><text start="1452.659" dur="3.421">travesty</text><text start="1453.919" dur="6.661">and we will slowly see the consequences</text><text start="1456.08" dur="6.479">we already are now if AI is able to make</text><text start="1460.58" dur="3.839">it so that a lot of the jobs we need</text><text start="1462.559" dur="4.401">done to keep civilization going can be</text><text start="1464.419" dur="5.401">done by Machine intelligence</text><text start="1466.96" dur="4.3">then the fact that we just made the</text><text start="1469.82" dur="3.3">future of Workforce completely</text><text start="1471.26" dur="4.56">incompetent isn&apos;t as big of a problem</text><text start="1473.12" dur="5.52">we&apos;ve also made them very docile</text><text start="1475.82" dur="4.8">a completely manipulable in terms of</text><text start="1478.64" dur="3.36">these social media Technologies so</text><text start="1480.62" dur="4.439">there&apos;s another scenario where we just</text><text start="1482.0" dur="5.6">build something like a complex Zoo</text><text start="1485.059" dur="5.161">and we house the youth in it</text><text start="1487.6" dur="5.5">and extract the ones who are needed to</text><text start="1490.22" dur="5.819">do the most creative work uh</text><text start="1493.1" dur="5.22">so none of these scenarios are good</text><text start="1496.039" dur="4.26">so the AI intervention is another thing</text><text start="1498.32" dur="3.06">that the Educators have to be very wary</text><text start="1500.299" dur="5.641">of</text><text start="1501.38" dur="7.679">um both AI induced systemic unemployment</text><text start="1505.94" dur="4.979">and AI tutoring systems</text><text start="1509.059" dur="3.36">what do you think about the tutoring</text><text start="1510.919" dur="3.901">systems do you think that would be good</text><text start="1512.419" dur="6.0">for for making it more individuated</text><text start="1514.82" dur="5.099">helping kids kind of find their own Dao</text><text start="1518.419" dur="2.941">so to speak their own personal path</text><text start="1519.919" dur="4.441">that&apos;s meaningful to them and</text><text start="1521.36" dur="5.04">intrinsically motivated so that the AI</text><text start="1524.36" dur="3.6">tutoring system is one of the most</text><text start="1526.4" dur="3.3">important conversations that can be</text><text start="1527.96" dur="3.44">having that can be taking place right</text><text start="1529.7" dur="5.88">now like</text><text start="1531.4" dur="7.86">these this will either be the thing that</text><text start="1535.58" dur="7.68">saves us or completely destroys us yeah</text><text start="1539.26" dur="6.159">and so I I there&apos;s so many AI risks and</text><text start="1543.26" dur="4.919">like this is one of the things that I do</text><text start="1545.419" dur="4.081">that you think about risk and as a</text><text start="1548.179" dur="3.36">philosopher of Education I think a lot</text><text start="1549.5" dur="3.0">about a weird class of risks which are</text><text start="1551.539" dur="2.941">the risks that

dur="4.079">if you fundamentally disrupt</text><text start="1558.38" dur="4.14">intergenerational transmission you&apos;ve</text><text start="1560.539" dur="4.321">just destroyed your Society</text><text start="1562.52" dur="5.34">do you think that Gap is part of the</text><text start="1564.86" dur="6.36">issue here in a sense because the</text><text start="1567.86" dur="5.22">previous generation just doesn&apos;t realize</text><text start="1571.22" dur="3.059">how quickly things are changing with</text><text start="1573.08" dur="3.3">technology and therefore can&apos;t</text><text start="1574.279" dur="3.961">understand it I&apos;m saying that the AI</text><text start="1576.38" dur="4.2">tutoring system</text><text start="1578.24" dur="5.76">makes possible</text><text start="1580.58" dur="5.219">a catastrophic bifurcation of</text><text start="1584.0" dur="3.9">international transmission of a type</text><text start="1585.799" dur="3.661">that could never exist without this type</text><text start="1587.9" dur="4.08">of Technology specifically because what</text><text start="1589.46" dur="6.0">you&apos;re going from is</text><text start="1591.98" dur="6.72">the human being is a biological being</text><text start="1595.46" dur="5.16">that is raised by other human beings</text><text start="1598.7" dur="3.66">to the human

dur="3.78">everyone&apos;s thinking yeah oh it&apos;s like a</text><text start="1612.86" dur="6.0">teacher</text><text start="1615.02" dur="5.759">this is an AI socialization system</text><text start="1618.86" dur="3.84">right don&apos;t think they&apos;re not coming for</text><text start="1620.779" dur="4.561">your parenting</text><text start="1622.7" dur="5.76">right they&apos;re coming

start="1630.559" dur="3.961">unit of where education resides and so</text><text start="1632.779" dur="3.741">the interesting question when you have</text><text start="1634.52" dur="3.659">the AI

dur="5.761">created a generation raised by machines</text><text start="1642.44" dur="6.3">not raised by humans what does it tell</text><text start="1645.44" dur="5.46">them about the prior humans which</text><text start="1648.74" dur="4.559">created it which it did not raise</text><text start="1650.9" dur="4.32">so this is two questions but given that</text><text start="1653.299" dur="4.62">the consillions project and a lot of</text><text start="1655.22" dur="4.319">what you&apos;re working on is</text><text start="1657.919" dur="3.541">figuring out how we navigate

dur="7.319">governance what do you see the approach</text><text start="1666.38" dur="5.399">to governing this one the social media</text><text start="1670.039" dur="6.661">aspect that we talked about that&apos;s just</text><text start="1671.779" dur="7.321">basically child abuse and the AI tutor</text><text start="1676.7" dur="4.859">aspect of things like how that develops</text><text

you think is best</text><text start="1686.299" dur="5.88">yeah so there&apos;s also a work I do at the</text><text start="1690.2" dur="3.78">at the office for the future with uh</text><text

dur="2.72">you know</text><text start="2212.619" dur="4.141">if I could do one thing with my magic</text><text start="2214.66" dur="5.4">wand</text><text start="2216.76" dur="6.06">I would affect the

just should stop</text><text start="2235.66" dur="2.58">basically</text><text start="2236.8" dur="3.539">um and that just seems simple it&apos;s kind</text><text start="2238.24" dur="3.66">of like

dur="3.72">difference it wouldn&apos;t it wouldn&apos;t solve</text><text start="2250.3" dur="3.44">everything and you&apos;d have to replace it</text><text start="2252.46" dur="3.78">with something</text><text start="2253.74" dur="3.7">uh so you&apos;d have to you&apos;d have to</text><text start="2256.24" dur="3.96">replace it with something because it was</text><text start="2257.44" dur="5.639">like an addict all of a sudden you know</text><text start="2260.2" dur="5.28">um but I think there are</text><text start="2263.079" dur="6.601">easy technical ways</text><text start="2265.48" dur="8.34">to solve that problem the problem is</text><text start="2269.68" dur="5.399">legal policy economic like okay but</text><text start="2273.82" dur="3.72">they&apos;re technically it&apos;s not a hard</text><text start="2275.079" dur="4.681">problem to solve right</text><text start="2277.54" dur="3.6">just cultural politicking</text><text start="2279.76" dur="4.02">because we&apos;re partly we used to think</text><text start="2281.14" dur="5.939">the algorithm is designed to do what</text><text start="2283.78" dur="4.68">all all of the work of all of these</text><text start="2287.079" dur="3.661">minds and all these millions of dollars</text><text start="2288.46" dur="4.379">is making this algorithm do what</text><text start="2290.74" dur="4.14">what if you changed with that algorithm</text><text start="2292.839" dur="3.601">was intended to do and you put all the</text><text start="2294.88" dur="4.44">money resources those same people into</text><text start="2296.44" dur="4.62">something else did I tell you hey either</text><text start="2299.32" dur="4.019">you do that or if you&apos;re engaging in</text><text

that Stark I</text><text start="2307.18" dur="3.06">think we have to start using language</text><text start="2308.56" dur="4.62">that is more</text><text start="2310.24" dur="4.26">apparent now as I already mentioned one</text><text start="2313.18" dur="3.12">of the reasons this isn&apos;t occurring is</text><text start="2314.5" dur="3.96">because the adults are also addicted to</text><text start="2316.3" dur="3.72">this thing and they&apos;re getting you&apos;re</text><text start="2318.46" dur="3.6">right even the people who make it are</text><text start="2320.02" dur="4.38">getting high on their own Supply</text><text start="2322.06" dur="4.08">uh and so the Senators and Congress</text><text start="2324.4" dur="4.08">people who would be responsible for</text><text start="2326.14" dur="3.78">creating the complex legislation would</text><text start="2328.48" dur="3.48">have to pay attention for more than 15</text><text start="2329.92" dur="4.32">minutes to something to write a coherent</text><text start="2331.96" dur="4.56">legislation that would be able to</text><text start="2334.24" dur="3.839">actually regulate an industry that is</text><text

the parents of</text><text start="2341.44" dur="2.52">kids who are addicted to these</text><text start="2342.64" dur="3.06">technology would have to put their own</text><text start="2343.96" dur="3.6">phone down and get off their own social</text><text start="2345.7" dur="3.6">media and regulate so</text><text start="2347.56" dur="4.74">so this isn&apos;t a problem with very</text><text
