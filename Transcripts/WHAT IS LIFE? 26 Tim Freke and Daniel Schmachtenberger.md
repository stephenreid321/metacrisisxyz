i think you're really going to enjoy this conversation with daniel i know i did he's incredibly lucid and his insights are very deep and comprehensive and probably because he is so attentive to that uh clarity that of what he says um when we started off it's the morning for me here in england it was late at night [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=23.279s)

middle of the night for him in the usa and um we've never talked before uh and daniel said well maybe we should get to know each other in this time and then you know i can because the things that you're interested in the philosophical issues are i feel like i i i'm reticent to talk about them in [42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=42.879s)

public before i'm you know i feel ready um and i completely get that um but i'm very pleased to say um i stopped recording and uh politely asked if it was possible that we could record anyway just because um i know that when we're spontaneous and these conversations are just that they're just [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=64.799s)

me having conversations with people that i'm really interested in that so much of the the magic can can go from the first conversation never makes it into the the subsequent one because you've already met so um i suggested we just recorded it anyway and if [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=84.4s)

he didn't feel like it had reached the level of clarity or he was concerned about the way things had gone then i'd just keep it private um but i think we had a phenomenally interesting conversation i i loved it and at the end he was more than happy for me to share it as part of this what is life series so i'm going to do that and here it is [102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=102.24s)

music enjoy so um okay so we've got this chance to get to know each other um so the premise that's making me the premise that's making me do the uh this what is life thing and why it gets into all of these spiritual areas for me um i was thinking about it waiting for this [139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=139.04s)

to you know to meet up with you it's that it feels like on your website i read this the line you you said you're interested in civilization design i just thought such a fantastic phrase and i love that and then it seems to me that actually how we see everything eventually lies on what we think reality is and that it and that really to get to those places somehow we have to start with with that hence the kind of like what is life what is existence of coming in on that as a starting place and going okay so what you you you have thought hugely about these areas since making evolution civilization [180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=180.0s)

design but underneath it there will be an idea about what reality might be and kind of wanting to start there to have the conversation rather than jump straight into the to the other stuff but i think what you said which is how we would want to design a civilization has to be grounded in a metaphysics um is true for philosophers i think you and i probably both have this experience of like well what is a desirable civilization is fundamentally an existential and ethical question what is good right yeah and then what is good is going to be bound to what is real how do i know what is [217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=217.599s)

real so foundational ethics aesthetics ontology epistemology like our preceding theory of governance or design or economics or anything else i don't find that functionally that's true for most people um most people have a felt sense of what is real and what they desire that's enough [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=238.0s)

for the basis of their behavior the interaction of their behaviors and the kind of emergent [[game theory]] and topology of that guiding the world um it doesn't have to have an integrated metaphysics it almost never does laughter but isn't it there unconsciously isn't there isn't there [255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=255.68s)

isn't the feeling that you were you you were mentioning before we started recording this that that that they're they're the the these areas are difficult to handle precisely because there is a mainstream view and and it and it percolates the thought i was having before we we talked was if all of if metaphysics spirituality [279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=279.759s)

for instance if that's all just baloney then you know it's great that we've left it behind but if it's actually pointing to something about the nature of reality and that the mystics through the ages weren't just crazy well-meaning people but we're actually exploring a certain level of what's real then if we don't factor that in and we [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=302.479s)

don't make it conscious and we don't see that it's relevant we'll be constantly missing we won't be dealing with ex with reality and therefore we won't function anywhere near as well as we might i i hear you partly saying that the philosophy of science is an inadequate epistemology for understanding the real that it's a way [325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=325.52s)

to understand the objective but not the whole of the real and that we've kind of conflated objective and real as synonyms when objective is more right to think of as a subset of the real so then the question is what is the expanded epistemology that includes but transcends the philosophy of science that can give us a relationship to the [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=341.759s)

real as a basis to understand and relate with what is which will also then be a basis for choice can i just take that word for word and put that in my next book that was beautifully put that was exactly what i was trying to say so that's kind of partly what i'm hearing you say is the need for the upgrade to epistemology [358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=358.72s)

and then partly what i'm hearing you say is that there's a there are interpretations of modernity and physicalism that lead to nihilism and uh that there is a desire for some grounding basis for something other than nihilism um and so a question of is there actually meaning [387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=387.44s)

and is the nihilism emerging from physicalism partly because physicalism is inadequate yes exactly exactly what's your thoughts on that uh yes physicalism is necessary but not sufficient i wouldn't say physicalism the philosophy of science is necessary but not sufficient physicalism is the [413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=413.68s)

kind of ism that the philosophy of science is sufficient um the idea that what is fundamentally real is physics is physical matter stuff third-person stuff and first-person stuff is either then illusory like in radical eliminativism or it's a epiphenomenon um and usually an a causal type of [434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=434.88s)

phenomena though there are some examples where it's an epiphenomena that has exerts top-down causation through quantum mechanics or something yeah um but yeah so i mean roughly we can say you have the domain of third-person stuff in the domain of first-person stuff right matter and [458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=458.8s)

music physics uh and then experience whatever you starting to get into words like consciousness subjectivity experience whether we think of those as synonyms are all different this is one of the reasons why i'm a little hesitant here is because i find that a lot of the wrong thinking is because is embedded all the way down to the words the seminar completely agree with you daniel i mean i couldn't agree with you more so i'm going to try and do like a very high level where i'm treating certain words as if they're symptoms where i think actually getting down to where they're not is pretty important [492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=492.96s)

yeah but if we if we just kind of take the classic philosophic dualism thing of this mind stuff and this matter stuff and you've got a kind of philosophy of science that says the matter stuff is primary and then there's correlation between the matter stuff and the mindset it seems because it seems like when people [513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=513.279s)

describing in different subjective states and we're doing uh eegs on them that we see the neural correlates of consciousness which means certain corresponding third person objective brain states corresponding with certain first person dynamics first person experiences but then the assumption is that physics is a causally closed system [531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=531.76s)

so the brain state this moment is the result of a brain state a moment ago unfolding by particle physics in the brain fundamentally and so to the degree that there is correlation between this third person brain system and first person first person must be an a causal epiphenomenon and you kind of have that model right [550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=550.32s)

physicalism with a lot of different sub flavors but you also have that the philosophy of science started with theory of measurement right so we're going to measure some stuff we're going to look for things that are both measurable and repeatable um and so there was already an ontological assumption that what is real is third-person measurable stuff and so we're going to go figuring out what is real by measuring stuff and then repeating the stuff there's a certain assumption about ontology that was baked into the epistemology so we got an epistemology that was good at looking for those [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=591.44s)

ontologic things so of course then it says what's real is the stuff that we we're looking at whereas for instance if i look at kind of buddhism and the coming out of the vedantic tradition they answered not what is real is what's measurable and repeatable but what is real is ex what i am experiencing prima facie a [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=609.279s)

little closer to descartes inquiry on that right i might not think i am but the prima facie experience of thinking the self-referentiality of that i am and so for them it's like maybe all this physics out here is all a dream maybe this is all a hallucination so what i can know for sure is that [628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=628.24s)

is arising so first person is for sure and third person is either illusory or an epiphenomenon of first person and but again their epistemology which is kind of inquiry into the nature of experience the phenomenological inquiry was based on also a kind of ontologic assumption that what is real is experience and they started that right there's this whole process that says notice the tree notice that you aren't the tree you're the noticer of the tree now notice your thoughts notice that they can come and go notice that you're not the thoughts of the notice or the thoughts etc etc and so then they point out you [667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=667.44s)

are the witness and but they were actually able to do that by starting with there is the subjectivity and objectivity bound to then be able to say subjective's primary in the same way that measurement is a measure measuring and measured they're bound to then be able to say the measured is fundamental and the measure isn't so you've got like [690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=690.88s)

idealism physicalism and then dualism which is kind of sloppy and then attempt set some kind of integral monism like boehm tried to do with an implicated order um and i would say that i would say that kind of vedantic idealism and physicalism are both reductionist in exactly the same way but it meters [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=714.079s)

of each other and most methods of dualism are just sloppy and they're not also not asking is the relationship between subjective and objective part of the class of subjective or is it part of the class of objective or is it neither is it a third distinct ontological class that insight helped this start really [740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=740.639s)

getting more formal for me this came from forrest landry's uh metaphysics um who should really be on your show um okay i don't know i don't know first forest um first develop something called the metaphysics in integrated formal metaphysics that claims to be at the upper boundary of what a [765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=765.44s)

metaphysics can be um and it's definitely the the closest thing to something that matches that claim that i've encountered so before you get into him though i just i just i just need to say this because i speak to a fair few people um along the way um that is the clue what you decide there is the closest [787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=787.68s)

to my own perceptions that i've probably heard which is exciting exactly that this is the thing here this is the thing there i've come personally much more from the um idealist eastern approach not just eastern but mystical approach that's been my background and where i've had to notice the assumptions [809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=809.839s)

and it's taken me taken me a long time to notice my own assumptions it's been it's been tough and and one of the things which caused a bit of a stir recently was coming out and making a little video saying i was wrong in 33 of my 35 books and uh precisely through seeing the level of that because it's so [827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=827.68s)

hard to see so it was really exciting to hear just say so clearly those two perspectives and why they're both kind of mirrors of each other i completely get that and what i would say instead is it the impulse to see the correlated things and ask which one is causally primary ends up being a mistaken impulse [847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=847.36s)

and that this inquiry is happening where there is a a subject considering an object and then asking about the fundamental nature of subjectivity and the fundamental nature of objectivity and and then usually forgetting to think about the fundamental nature of the relationship between subjectivity and [873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=873.68s)

objectivity yes so so the phrase which works for me right now in trying to express this is is going look the mistake i hear in sort of advaitic philosophy and all that stuff that i've been around is that it's all one but actually it's more interesting it's actually the one in relationship to itself and that [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=892.32s)

that oneness with the word that that i would use for is what exists being in relation to itself in a process of becoming and so everything and this i think is the great insight of physics now everything's relationship everything's relational everything time space energy everything it's it's all relational information [912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=912.399s)

which is describing uh the qualities of being and that therefore there is no subject and object separately there's only the objects subjectively perceived and that subject and object relationship goes right down into the actually i think it goes into numbers but it certainly goes into um the quantum particles and physics and [934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=934.079s)

all that and then right the way up to you and me where the world i perceive is the world i perceive because of my nature and that everything has that interconnected subject object and that the [[evolutionary process]] isn't an objective one it's a relational one yeah and that's what's been going on for [956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=956.48s)

14 billion years whenever we say something like um vedic philosophy or even worse eastern philosophy and so specifically at minimum six primary schools of vedic philosophy yes absolutely right this school called karma which comes right before vedanta in the set of six actually put forward a my understanding [987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=987.279s)

of it a triadic fundamental ontology that was actually critical to understand the way vedanta talked about oneness which was a oneness of plurality rather than oneness of singularity yeah and so they had you know you can think of it superficially as brahma vishnu and shiva but but it related [1009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1009.68s)

in the kind of core philosophy to the knower the known and the process of knowing or the observer they observed in the process of observation the measure the measured in the process measurement subject object relationship between them that those were seen as co-defining co-arising distinct but inseparable and that the oneness was the oneness of plurality of those always occurring together but that that includes fundamental distinction yep yep that's it and and yeah you're absolutely right and i'm you know we use these short hands like east and west it's just ridiculous but um but yeah that that you can see these resonances that come through you [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1057.44s)

mentioned dialectics fair man i think there's a lot in dialectical thought which is trying to point to this to this the same thing so so so you know our original conversation was to was i had in mind was to say to you know what what for you is your um thing and i know you you you might not be comfortable to explore [1076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1076.88s)

it publicly but what you know why is that first that's an interesting thing for this thing that may not go live why i'm fascinated what what is it that you that you you're reticent about and what actually is your underlying view of reality would you say uh what is my underlying view of reality all right let let me cover let me just [1109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1109.36s)

forget the reasons why you might not be you might not be comfortable get back to that later i am intrigued by that um i what i'm trying to say is what i wanna i wanna let me here's tim he's 61. he's gonna die within the next whatever 30 years for sure well probably and [1130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1130.559s)

i'm doing my best to make sense of this and it's not just a theoretical thing it's my life and it affects everything i do every single day to make to really take in what's happening to what it is to be alive and to experience it with depth and to meet it with love what when i what's daniel's what's daniel made of it on his i'm sure strange journey through all of this so i'm thinking around how to construct this so the place that i want to start is where lao tzu started first verse of the tao te ching is the [1192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1192.96s)

doubt that is speakable is not the eternal dao and the knowledge that is knowable is not the eternal knowledge which was a pre-statement of girls and completeness theorem or i've never thought that that's beautiful and it was in the later theorems in girdle and tarsky [1217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1217.12s)

and similarly heisenberg and bell's theorems which were all upper bounds of no ability they're actually logic's ability to recognize the limits of logic relative to reality and so with girdle serum you get that you can have a system that's consistent or complete but not both the the cis system of math has a fundamental infinity involved which [1241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1241.2s)

logic can't do the fundamental infinity um and yet there's this very interesting question of what was running in girdle in his awareness that was not math and what was running in tarski that wasn't a formal logical system that could recognize the limits of the pharmacological system right right [1267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1267.919s)

so i think the moment we try to say here's the sense i've made of reality and i'm going to convert all of reality and what is real what is meaningful the true the good the beautiful i'm going to try to convert that to a couple sentences or to a book it's definitely going to be wrong and then to the degree i try to live [1294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1294.159s)

based on that model it's going to suck and to the degree to which i really try to push for intellectual congruency i can tell it's wrong and so then i'm left either searching more or with some kind of nihilism or having to at some point suddenly lie to myself that one of the things that i'm thinking about that's [1314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1314.4s)

kind of squishy is more logically sound than it really is um the the the biblical have no false idols the way that i relate to that is if reality is sacred to me then no understanding of reality that will always be in information compression on reality [1338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1338.559s)

listen reality is sacred to me i don't make my model an idol and so i'm actually not my confidence margin on any belief system about the world is never 100 and my connection to the world is not mediated through them so the reason i'm saying this is because [1360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1360.559s)

we're having a conversation in words as philosophically interested people but do you mean when you say it's not mediated through them do you mean it's not entirely mediated through them yes not entirely yeah because it presumably is mediated through them to some degree this is something we should come back to so my felt sense and experience of life and the meaningfulness and the beauty of it exists of any cognitive models i have about the nature of aesthetics and ethics and um there's a quote by uh joseph campbell i don't remember it [1414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1414.88s)

exactly there was something to the effect of that we search for the meaning of life when we don't feel connected to the feeling of aliveness um but what we're actually really looking for is the felt experience of full aliveness and the shadow of that is the idea of what is the meaning of life [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1432.72s)

and i don't think that's the whole truth but i think it's an interesting insight so um i can come back to that thing of what is base experience what is modeling what like what are the modes of perception and consciousness and how do they relate to each other um but the reason i want to start with this is to say [1456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1456.48s)

i can share some models about ontology what do i think is real and what do i think the nature of consciousness and meaningfulness and evolution are in time and i know that everything that i'm saying is at best partial yeah that's same i would say so do you want to go somewhere with that [1484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1484.88s)

or do you want me to come back just modes of perspective well i'll let me let me just um let me just respond you know by agreeing so for me the foundation um i wrote a book my book before the last one was called the mystery experience so so for a long from for decades really [1503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1503.44s)

part of what i felt my role was was just to talk to people going have you noticed you don't know what this is and that was it it was like it's just to encounter the mystery so that profound sense of mystery is absolutely the foundation it never goes and it's never diminished and then alongside that over the last 10 15 years um my emphasis has been much [1528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1528.24s)

more on okay so you know to use a very crude analogy if we want a map of the terrain the map will never be the terrain the menus not the meal etc etc but there's a handy thing to have and it can be better or worse and it will govern how we think about it and it will govern how we act and what we do and what we value [1549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1549.6s)

and and changes in it can open up a perception which you didn't have before of something about the nature of life so when you get a more expansive understanding suddenly your actual reality can expand and so holding those two together in what i call a kind of paralogical pair so it's not choosing one or the other [1570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1570.32s)

but being able to sit with a mystery and this is my best guess but it's not well it's not just a guess it's the best guess that i've been able to think about and push and pull and doubt and and this is this seems to have some value this this accounts for more of my experience and more of what i know of the [1588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1588.96s)

experience of others than anything else i've got so far and these areas still don't make sense and this area doesn't make sense but this area is beginning to perhaps that's kind of where it feels like this stuff is of value yeah um a way i relate to what you're saying right now [1608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1608.48s)

is um there's a certain kind of you can call it spiritual maturity emotional psychological maturity uh if it has to do with comfort with both uncertainty and certainty yeah and it's easy to have to err on the side of either of those um erring on the side of certainty we know what that looks like it looks like [1635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1635.6s)

you know fundamentalism and it usually is seeking security by being overcertain about what reality is but the kind of um post-modern compensation that any certainty is going to be some kind of bad imperialism so i'll just uh laud uncertainty uh it is also a bias yeah and i want to be seeking increased certainty [1657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1657.2s)

so that i can make better choices but i don't want false over certainty so i want to be asking what is my confidence margin on a particular thing based on what episemic process and what is the right epistemic process for the domain and what level of confidence do i need to act factoring the consequentiality of non-action as well [1676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1676.559s)

so given that what the going on what do you think this is that we're in what is this experience we're having what's your best guess right now work in progress when you say what is this do you i mean literally i mean literally what is this what is this thing that [1704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1704.0s)

we're in we're having this human experience what the hell is it you mean like do i have an origin story on whether i think the big bang or the simulation hypothesis or that maybe maybe but i don't necessarily mean that i mean that i mean that we're faced with you know you know maybe i'm saying more about me here and just kind of seeing what your response is but you know i wake up every morning and this is happening and it's been going on for a long time and it keeps changing and it keeps getting deeper and more interesting and so my ques i think what i'm kind of [1743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1743.679s)

asking is is really that it's like hey daniel what what what what do you think's what is it that we're experiencing here actually and and what should we do with it and that's individual that's collective it's like does that make any more sense am i still being inarticulate [1764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1764.559s)

but it feels like a lot of different questions together all of which are actually kind of hard because when i say what are we experiencing i have what is the nature of reality my core ontologic question yep then i also have what is the nature of experience go for the first one and then and then that's the head for the second one maybe [1792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1792.48s)

after the first one i don't feel like i can do it justice in any i mean at all but do it in a reasonable amount of time because i mean i can tell you reality models like the simulation hypothesis or the um physicalist big bang hypothesis or the tear deter don model and i can tell you [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1843.52s)

what i think is wrong with them right um in terms of the description of reality and then i can say what that kind of points to but to try to say what is the nature of reality is going to have okay let me phrase it let me phrase it differently that might appeal to you more what does it help if i say and we don't [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1864.08s)

have to go down this road you know we can go down any road it's just lovely to talk to you um uh would it would it would it be easier if i said of all the models that you are aware which is the one that attracts you as the most um adequate given the inadequacy of all of them and like zoo's [1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1886.399s)

first line um i think i think the terra du chardon line of inquiry kind of intersecting with the bohmian line of inquiry uh is interesting and good and i kind of came up through that and then i think when you start to look [1919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1919.44s)

at say stuart kaufman's work music some parts get added i think the question around and i heard you uh talk about this i think in a ted talk um is consciousness or mind and [[emergent property]] of biology or life that evolved at a certain point um i think that's a very problematic idea [1950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1950.24s)

um and so what is fundamental and what's evolving are the constants constant or the laws a priori or are the laws evolving if it's all of all emerging what is the basis of emergence itself right these are is emergence fundamental there's some very deep questions in there um [1974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1974.08s)

music and the nature of time there's assumptions built into the idea of evolution about the nature of time and so we have to get into that and of course to get into that we have to get into the epistemics of how would we know how would we base that proposition um so what we end up coming to is [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=1994.159s)

just a handful of really hard problems like some generally good feeling kinds of things that seem to answer some stuff and some really hard problems at the boundary conditions um the best answers i have seen towards those really hard problems in an integrated fashion so far is this eminent metaphysics that i was telling you about that um [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2017.36s)

it actually did this beautiful thing where it was able to express godel's theorem and tarski's theorem and bell serum and heisenberg's theorem as special case instances of a generalized theorem of the ontologic upper bounds of nobility within a domain and then it was able to create a metaphysics [2038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2038.72s)

that showed that it was the upper bound of no ability across all domains which means that like the dow deiching it's it's still saying there is reality outside of this but this is the upper bound on what you can do with models um what was the guy's name again daniel [2057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2057.599s)

forrest landry and i'll connect with him he should be on here but you'll you need to take a meaningful amount of time because one of the one of the places where some of the breakthroughs occurred was him really formalizing semiotics okay um and that there ended up being quite a lot of bad ideas baked into the [2077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2077.919s)

way we use the words and the way we compound meanings endless i think and uh so there ends up being a lot of concepts that kind of need deconstructed and then um posited and you know what is the minimum axiom set i can't derive the axioms what i can do is reify them afterwards and say did that axiom set give more [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2098.64s)

refined power than any other axiom set um music so yeah so there's part of me that wants to dive in and go hey you know and share with you the ideas i've been exploring around time and and mind and all these things um and it's part of me that wants to [2130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2130.079s)

to talk to you about civilization because it feels like that's something i i find what you're saying about that absolutely fascinating and i yeah um so so but in terms of the ted talk let me just say a little bit in terms of the ted talk i think what i'm because i come from a uh a kind of a phenomenological inquiry fundamentally which has all been about awakening and you know all of that so for me it's like i look at this the whole time and so what i see when i look at this is time is that one thing changes into another so and i also see that what what happens with when it changes is that every new moment [2171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2171.76s)

has never happened before so something about the nature of time is it's constantly realizing new potentials and then it feels like every new moment is based on the one that came before in a new way and it contains the past in it it's implicit in it so that the past hasn't gone anywhere it's actually it's actually not passing [2192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2192.16s)

it's actually accumulating and that everything that's ever happened is implicit in this moment right from you know us connecting learning to speak english the evolution of the human body the big everything whatever's happened whatever it is that's happened everything is implicit in there and right now everything that daniel's ever [2209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2209.839s)

been is meeting everything that tim's ever been so that time becomes something absolutely fundamental because it's the accumulation of all of the realized information and and then what i'm what i'm what i'm exploring myself and i don't know whether it's going to work [2227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2227.04s)

but so far it's really got my attention is based on that based on that's what every moment i've ever experienced is is it possible and now we know that it's been going on for 14 billion years it seems one with one understanding and it's got us from like brian swim says from hydrogen to you and me having this conversation [2247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2247.2s)

so it seems to be emerging things build on each other and you can't have this until you've had got this and so forth that whether it's possible to account for what existence is with a simple idea of emergence that is being in the process of becoming or it's the realization of potentialities in [2270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2270.079s)

ever more emerging ways and that everything that has equality is emergent and that the based quality would be the one thing that everything has which is being which is so obvious it's kind of sounds uninteresting but it's not i don't think i think it is interesting that there's a there's a commonality of being which is taking on all of these different forms [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2289.359s)

as it becomes as that process of time or emergence or becoming unfolds and that because it's the one in relationship to itself all of that is relational and that relationality will it will will first be physical relationality which is electrochemical and all of that then it will be biological which will become the senses and then it will [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2311.599s)

become imaginable um but that's one expanding thing and it hasn't explained consciousness but we'll leave that for another time and the but did you see do you see what i'm trying to say very quickly there that's the kind of so it's it's the the thing which is kind of grabbed my soul and shaking me around is like [2331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2331.2s)

is it is that is there a way in which ever we can see that everything so not like the spiritual the the whole spiritual realm as it were whatever the hell name you give to that the whole the whole tradition is that always exists and we fall from it then you've got the scientific model which is we evolved up to being animals and then this is funny [2353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2353.119s)

epic phenomena called the mind or the psyche of going what if this is an eternal but it is a it is a domain of existence which has emerged just like the biological ecology has emerged the ecology of soul or psyche has also emerged and that when you go off into it which is what i've spent my life doing [2374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2374.0s)

it's massive and huge and and worthy of immense attention and interactive not like an extra stuck on the top but the most emergent level that's constantly interacting with it in fact it is right now you know my intentionality which is imaginable information is making my mouth move i don't know how it does it but it does [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2394.56s)

and so that's the kind of overarching thing i've been trying to see if i can make work as a as a thesis to combine these different forms of knowledge that interests me science and spirituality i i think what i'm going to say is a clarification that you probably um agree with or at least have thought about but it's important [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2432.48s)

a starting place for me to say that there are properties of mind particularly certain types of symbolic representation and formal logic and that are results of abstraction that uh seem to be pretty unique to humans maybe starting with an earlier species like homo habilis or whatever [2453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2453.839s)

um and that that is kind of a emergent domain that didn't exist before it obviously here and that that um is both an emergent kind of subjective domain and objective the technosphere the anthropocene is obviously a result of it yep yes sure that's clear [2479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2479.76s)

the kind of tear du chardon idea that evolution was increasing the orderly complexity of things in and basically selecting for [[emergent property|emergent properties]] what natural selection would be selecting for was something that had some adaptive capacity that was things that came together in a [2501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2501.2s)

particular way that had [[emergent property]] and that with humans you have a the level of complexity to have abstraction as an [[emergent property]] that can then contemplate evolution and so we are the [[evolutionary process]] wake to itself and then can consciously implement it that kind of our marks hubbard [2524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2524.88s)

and friends idea uh i think they're i'm not going to say that is true i will say there is truth and there is beauty in that idea music that's very different than saying sentience or consciousness is an epiphenomenon of biology or of neural networks that's very very different um [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2548.839s)

like and you at one point i think called it soul is is soul or psyche and this is where we need to define our words um the idea of i would maybe define kind of weak strong and radical emergence as three different types of ideas we talk about emergence weak emergence is where things come together where you get more of an [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2577.44s)

existing property that was already there as a result of synergies strong emergencies where you get a new property that wasn't there before at all radical emergence is the idea that you can get a uh a totally different kind of ontological domain so the idea that the domain of first person that isn't made up of uh atoms and magnetic fields and gravity and electrons but it's made up of feelings and uh sensations and thoughts and longings and emotions the the domain of subjectivity is an [[emergent property]] of the complexity of objectivity i'm not saying yeah that's what i was saying i think you probably weren't saying um in which case we get to this even harder thing of having to formalize something like pan psychism well that's why that's why getting into that um i feel getting into my area and i'd like to get into yours but we'll maybe get to that after we just [2639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2639.68s)

finished with us but um it goes back to the thing we we i said earlier like the one in relationship to itself so it's transactive it's subject and object at the same time and everything is the relationship between those two poles and they can't exist independently and so the whole universe [2656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2656.88s)

like right now it's like everything is is so subjectivity is there right from the start so like the classic hard problem thing i think is three problems where does subjectivity come from where does uh conscious sentience come from where does conscious psyche come from and i think they're three separate things so so subjectivity which is the real hard problem the big one my response is it's not pan psychism exactly or even experientialism like whitehead says it's although that maybe that's what they're trying to point to they're just not good words [2690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2690.48s)

it's pan subjectivity for like transactivity that it's right the way down all the time is the interaction between perspectives on the one on itself so the subject's right there that's that doesn't arrive it's not emerging it's there it is itself emerging on in relationship it's constantly emerging on other levels so that when you reach the biological level um and i don't because i'm not you know i'm not reductionist so when i talk about information i don't mean it's really the matrix i mean there is information which has become this we're us you know it's real i think so that we are reading information everything is reading information on every level um and on our on the biological level i i wonder whether it's just we can understand it simply as the level of the information being read is so complex now and some of it really [2746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2746.24s)

matters because with life there comes a gender to survive to reproduce to eat not be eaten all of that stuff so that some of the information that the the particular system is receiving really matters and the rest of it doesn't and it prioritizes information and what i notice again when i look at my experiences it looks like that's what [2767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2767.52s)

consciousness is it's the information i prioritize the stuff that matters and that it's a focused subjectivity so that when i focus on it it does this and then the vast vast vast amount of information is just being processed unconsciously but a certain amount of it i i focus on and that becomes lifted up [2790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2790.64s)

and as it evolves into the level we've got you get that sensory and it goes into hd it becomes vivid everything which which becomes a focus the more focus the subjectivity the more vivid the reality and then that in its turn is going to lead to the processing of everything which is going on like the whole universe is building up this it's like a learning machine it's like it's it's it's learning how to be learning the habits the algorithms or whatever it's going to make it function and i'm the same and and that that once you've got that ability to have focused subjectivity you can focus not only on [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2831.2s)

the information coming in but the processing of the information and that's the beginning of a whole new level of emergence then because then you're not focusing on the tree which is there you're focusing on the memory of the tree that isn't there and now you've got an image so you've now got images and then ideas [2848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2848.48s)

about images and ideas about ideas about ideas and you're beginning to see and then that's giving rise to a whole new level of both subjective and objective reality because it seems clear as day to me that the information that i'm passing to you now is not in the funny sounds it's on a different level and yet there it is it exists and it can't be reduced [2870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2870.0s)

to the funny sounds i'm making so that's more that's the kind of picture that i've been playing with and that that that domain then exists now just like the life domain now exists and it's not some side effect or anything it's just a more emergent level of reality um which is huge which is really is evolving exponentially it's where all [2890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2890.559s)

the evolution has been happening for quite some time yeah i think i i think i agree i'm i'm pausing because uh again formalizing our terms even exists and is real um it's anonymous um does math exist is it real or not necessarily the same question based on how they're defined and a lot of the problems come down to this stuff so i'm just going to skip that for the moment what i hear you saying is that you defined at least three different levels of first person um i don't remember what you called the first one it wasn't pen and psychism it was pan sensing [2952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2952.079s)

i mean like the phrase that i just to differentiate call it pan subjectivism because it's like it's what it's saying is there is first person or that that everything is a perspective whether it's the perspective of something physical something um biological or something psychological right so and because you haven't got it because [2978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2978.8s)

you because you're not saying it's got some little bit of consciousness in it or because it's got some bit of psyche you don't have the the problem of the accumulation of you know the whole problem with in pan psychism of just like adding more and more soul in or adding more and more consciousness in what would that mean you're just i'm simply saying everything [2995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=2995.599s)

is a perspective everything that exists as an independent system of some or relatively independent system has a perspective on the whole and is reading all the other systems and exists only in relationship to them and that what exists is the relationship between them yes so now we have to define and exist and this is that kohan of if a tree falls in [3021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3021.68s)

the forest to say something exists posits that it could possibly be interacted with otherwise what does it mean to posit that it exists and how would i know yeah and so interactive potentiality which is relationality is critical in defining exists yeah so uh if you want i'll share a something about this that's formalized [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3067.68s)

in that system of metaphysics i was describing that i think is a very uh insightful way of thinking about it so we say that perception is fundamental and it's linking a perceiver and perceived and that those words are co-defining each other the words don't mean anything without each other and that the realities the words point to are also co-defining that perceiver isn't a meaningful antic thing without process of perception and perceived and that perception which is the relationship between perceiver and perceived is more fundamental because prima facie the [3109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3109.76s)

experience of perception is occurring now it could be that the thing i'm perceiving the light waves altered on my way here or the nature of the experience had some distortion in it so it might not be what i'm thinking it is or perceiving it as and i might not be the nature of the perceiver that i think i am but the perception is occurring is kind of [3129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3129.52s)

fundamental this is another way of restating descartes there right and so then if we so if we're going to build a metaphysics we start by saying perceiver perceived perception are distinct inseparable and non-interchangeable and perception is fundamental and so then we're building a metaphysics [3154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3154.4s)

of perception right and then we can identify there's a few different types of perception that are distinct from each other and i think the three that you said map perfectly to the way this is modeled but then there's a proof of closure that there's not more than those three um so [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3175.599s)

you get a a a closed triplicate ontology um so the first one you think called the eminent mode of perception indwelling in the moment in the experience and the nature of the perception itself this is perceiver perceiving perceived directly so i don't have any narrative running right i'm not self-aware in the process [3202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3202.079s)

it's just the experience of perception so their their whole spiritual processes just trying to get people to be in that state where they aren't modeling and thinking about it and having uh abstraction on top of it but are just in direct sensory experience right and that's where what the perceiver is perceiving is [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3223.839s)

some object of perception directly but then those are stored in memory and i can actually perceive my previous perceptions which is one step abstracted yeah we can call that an omniscient mode standing on the outside being able to look at it from the outside and this is where i can not just have my [3248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3248.8s)

eminent experience of you in the moment but i can have many experiences of you where i try to now model who you are or try to model how physics works or whatever it is so this is now the domain of knowledge modeling semiotics and i can also take another step back so i was perceiving the perceived then i [3274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3274.24s)

was perceiving the perceptions as their own new objects right then i can perceive perception itself yeah which is a transcendental mode which is what ramana maharshi was talking about and laid onto talking about and so then one of the very interesting things that that system goes on to do is to be able to show that you don't get [3297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3297.52s)

infinite recursion on that that you actually get a kind of a ring or loop process between those modes and that there's actually an order in which they process so when i was saying earlier that my experience of reality is not mediated to the models what i mean is that the eminent mode [3317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3317.359s)

actually comes before the omniscient mode one of the axioms is that a whole class of the eminent precedes a single instance of the omniscience and it has to because if i haven't had a whole class of first-person experiences like multiple of them then i can't model a single thing we can't come up with a single model then [3339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3339.359s)

a whole class of the omniscient precedes an instance of the transcendent i can't perceive perception itself unless i can notice what is common across lots of perceptions fantastic and then the closure is that a class of the transcendent precedes a single instance of the eminent and this is a little bit harder [3362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3362.319s)

but um music choice happens as an eminent mode music in an actual choice to do a particular thing happens but the choice is a selection process out of a plurality of potentials the plurality of the potentials existing in the transcendent [3383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3383.2s)

then moves into action in the eminent um so or i can also say uh a whole series of models are involved in my in the actual neurological processing of any particular eminent mode experience that's occurring so uh yes i'm not just perceiving through the models but my perception is being colored by the models all the time [3411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3411.44s)

yeah right so this class instance relationship and the directionality of proceeds ends up being one of the axioms of the system and a proof of closure then that system goes on to say that these three modes of perception eminence omniscience transcendent um that there are corollaries there's a a handful of axioms and that there are [3438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3438.48s)

corollaries in every domain that there are instances of each of those modes that define the fundamental ontologic axis of any domain so you end up being able to take the foundational metaphysics and see fractal-like projections of it within all the various domains [3458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3458.16s)

i love that that's really really insightful and i i'm not quite sure about the last bit that you said was more difficult i'll go back to that another time but the other the other the other um way of seeing it i really really can relate to absolutely makes complete sense to me yeah beautiful beautiful really really [3482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3482.48s)

elegant yeah i think um so for if if we define a metaphysics as something that would ground a physics right um than a a physics as per tarsky's theorem which is defining the laws within a domain a physics isn't going to be able to [3514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3514.96s)

define its own axioms and if it's consistent it won't be complete right so then the metaphysics is what is the basis by which we are assessing the adequacy of one phys one set of axioms over another relative to the [[base reality]] there's something that isn't within that set of physics that's giving us the ability to assess the effectiveness of the [3536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3536.48s)

physics right this is what you were pointing to earlier yeah yeah yeah okay and so um so um while a physics is grounded in the metaphysics in western system that'll be things like formal logic and mathematics and positivism and stuff like that um music a metaphysics can't be grounded in something outside of itself to be a metaphysics if it's supposed to have a kind of closure so it needs to explain reality explain itself and explain the process by which it explained the other two so that no concepts are imported into the explanation process [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3576.88s)

yeah and that's you get a closure on a metaphysical system so the way that derivation happens there is really quite elegant yeah wow fantastic so i'm i'm i it's been such a delight daniel to connect with you i'm just aware that it's the middle of the night for you um but i i did i get the impression [3596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3596.48s)

you're a bit of a night aisle or i am you are um so i'm aware if if if we're getting to the point where it's getting a bit late for you then you just need to tell me because it's just the morning for me uh we can wrap soon but was there anywhere else you wanted to go over here yeah loads of places it's just a joy to talk to you and and um we've not we've gone into areas that i didn't expect which is nice um and you've said things much closer to uh ways that i'm exploring than i expected um which was not completely unexpected but was it is [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3634.799s)

was it's been very interesting um and i enjoyed that uh but i really wanted to talk a little bit about about society and and the general sense-making thing and civilization and there's a whole nother conversation really but um let's just maybe we can just touch on a little bit because i that's another area where so i have this [3654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3654.16s)

again i'll just say very very quickly and then you can take it from there but so where i'm heading now is i'm wanting to articulate this evolutionary um metaphysics the idea that everything can be accounted for as within some very simple assumptions um is that possible but i'm interested in it i'm it's not for me it's never [3674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3674.64s)

been just about understanding it's about what we what we're about being alive and what we do with it and so there's also wanting to make it practical spiritually and also in terms of how we we are evolving collectively so i've got this word which i just find [3691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3691.44s)

useful one of that what i see happening is that the or what might be happening is that we're evolving from individuals in to what i'm calling individuals which are individuals conscious of unity conscious of conscious that they are the universe and to me the way that i approach that is like what the hell else could i be [3713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3713.68s)

it's like of course i am it's like there's the universe and me is there that's how's that work you know it's like i am the universe as tim meeting the universe is daniel and what i've been exploring with awakening to the the to the oneness of things and the connectivity and the love that comes with that is how that affects how i live and then how we affect how we live collectively so i'm i'm interested in the in a movement from this intense individualism which i think has been very positive but not what i see with the thing which i'm opposing in spirituality for instance is the older traditions which are very popular [3751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3751.76s)

right now of the self is an illusion the individual's in the way it's all your ego man get rid of you tim's the problem it feels like no i don't think that's at all right it feels like no the individual the evolution of the individual has been the foundation from which we can wake up to a deeper sense of our being which is one with the being of all and that fundamentally shifts then because you're no longer just an individual in relationship to the one you're the one in relationship to itself and the more i explore that the deeper and deeper it you know comes and goes but it gets it gets deeper and it changes there's and what comes with it is this kind of universal benevolence because you're in a different relationship um so that's what i'm exploring in relation to us how we might change things collectively and my feeling is it's been happening for a long time it's just we don't notice it so i know i know you have some you know worries about the way that society's going i do too but also it blows me away when i look at history just how well things have gone and that there's so much more compassion in the world than there was just 50 years ago you know or that my [3818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3818.64s)

dad had to fight in the second world war and i'm an englishman who's never been in war which is pretty damn rare probably never happened before and all of that and and that people care about other species why but they do or other races on the other side of the world why but they do [3836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3836.16s)

and and it feels like there's this underlying growth of this of of universalism of a connection and i and and so i wanted to what i wanted to just see is it does that in any way intersect with what you're exploring or is that a completely different thing yeah i'll um i'll say some thoughts that came to mind when you're expressing that [3860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3860.799s)

um i don't mean this in a way to dissuade the uh uh the work towards a kind of metaphysics that can be oriented to people at all um in just my own experience because when i was thinking about theory of governance and theory of economics and like that it fundamentally came down to well [3887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3887.28s)

the basis of governance is going to be rule of law rule of law is going to be based on jurisprudence jurisprudence is based on ethics there's an existentialism of what is good we can't answer these things with the philosophy of science as long as i have an is odd distinction um where science can say what it is but can't say what aw then [3906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3906.24s)

it can build better and better technologies to affect what is with no basis to guide in which way other than market theory and [[game theory]] which ends up [[self-terminating]] at increasing power so how do we get a metaphysics that can is it possible to have a non-relativistic ethics that is [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3924.64s)

commensable with the philosophy of science that can bridge the is autumn distinction and be a refined basis for a theory of governance i still like that idea but i've kind of given up on the idea that in any reasonable time frame there's going to be some integrated metaphysics that everybody buys and things was [3941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3941.839s)

properly derived and properly closed um and so i i think my ambitions are a little humbler at the moment with regard to that and you know there are many different philosophic views that have led to love and charity and non-violence and whether i think all souls are separate but made by god so there's a divine [3968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3968.079s)

spark and love thy neighbor as thyself or whether i believe in reincarnation and they might be my mom in the past life or whether i just care about all sentient beings and suffering and i think that there is no afterlife or or whether i'm a kind of greek stoic philosopher who has ideas [3991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=3991.599s)

of what virtue is and i want to behave in others in a way that's aligned with that i can work with any of those kind of there um so i i don't need that that arises from a particular kind of theology or metaphysics i need that it orients to a particular set of experiences [4015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4015.68s)

that reify the meaningfulness of life and the sacredness of life that lead to the kinds of emergent behaviors that are aligned with the well-being of life so you said sacredness of life there daniel what what made you say that word um i said sacredness i said meaningfulness and these are both philosophic topics [4043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4043.2s)

right um don't let me sidetrack you i'm i really i'm interested in what you think what those are in the what what's the thing that we can is have you been able to articulate or even begin to for yourself like what those simple orientations might be that could sure be very i'll do it very prosaically [4062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4062.0s)

sacred and sacrifice have the same etymology and so what is sacred to me is something i'm willing to make sacrifices for well beautiful and um what is essentially sacred is what is worth more to me than my life and if i know what is worth more to me than my life and i make sure that the choices of my life [4085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4085.839s)

not just giving my life but giving my my living is aligned with that that's very helpful and if i hold that life itself with a capital l is sacred and sentient and experiences then i would never unduly harm it and it can be because we're all sparks of the same god or because we're all facets [4109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4109.679s)

of the same self or because consciousness emerged out of these brains and we die soon and we want people to have the best experiences they can and the short little bit of sentience like i said and kind of work with any of those um but but there are some you can't really work with because they orient towards not recognizing life as sacred or meaningful um so you were talking about the no self idea there is there is a way that there are interpretations of buddhist thought that can make someone a nihilist because if this is all maya none of it's real including that hungry kid isn't real and my desire to go feed them is actually the sign of my unenlightenment and ignorance that i bought into this maya so that's not just making them annihilus it's making them a sociopath through adopting a spiritual idea that disconnects them from empathy and experience and so that idea doesn't work and the [4178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4178.159s)

same idea that if somebody prays to the wrong other god you have to kill them um or that because it's there's no free will and consciousness is an adaptive illusion might as well just unibomber everything so there there are versions of them that don't work right but there are versions [4200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4200.64s)

of all of those that end up leading to a kind of respect for the integrity of life that orients us to behave as stewards of it and i can i can kind of work with any of those but when we're talking about the kind of society we want to make and we're talking about governance governance is a process of shared choice [4221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4221.04s)

making so then what is the basis of the choice we make well it's epistemology and ethics it's our sense-making of what is and what the effects of a particular injunction will be a law or a technology or whatever and it's our value set of what is valuable what is meaningful that we want [4239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4239.679s)

to make choices in service to so our ability for collective choice making through something like democracy or any process like that is going to be grounded in our ability for collective [[sensemaking]] which means individual [[sensemaking]] an ability to communicate effectively and ability to explicate what we value [4255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4255.84s)

and what we're trying to serve with a particular injunction understand other people's values and find higher order dialectics of values to then be able to come up with strategies that can meet everyone's values aligned with what we're sensing more effectively yeah well i would like to talk more about that one [4278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4278.8s)

day that's fascinating and and i feel like we've kind of done a whole lot of philosophical stuff which i guess is the kind of nature of the the the conversation i invited you to but there's so much there that i find fascinating and yeah it's just been a delight to hang out with your your insights and your with you really [4296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4296.239s)

yeah likewise this was fun yeah uh and maybe we will talk more on civilization topics at some point and i would definitely be up for that if you if if you are daniel this could be part one um how do you feel about making any of this public i thought you were brilliant i mean i've [4315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4315.36s)

you just just seemed just as clear as clearer than just by anyone i've talked to to be honest with you daniel you have a yeah i don't know if any of this will be useful to anybody else but i i'm happy for it to be well you know it's kind of i gave up on that you know it's like like i said for me it was it was an excuse you know if i didn't have this excuse we probably [4333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4333.76s)

we may never have this conversation um yeah so i've been able to go around to a whole load of really interesting people um and and have conversations uh that seems cool i mentioned forest but i have a couple other people i think would be worth coming on as well so i'm happy to make the introductions oh please do that would be i'd be really [4350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4350.4s)

really uh really really grateful and so yeah cool all right so um well let's connect about part two we'll email or um i don't have your email actually but um facebook facebook works and uh i'll give you my email there and then we can do the introductions over email great [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ammJN0yCCbs&t=4373.12s)

all right well good good have a good night you
