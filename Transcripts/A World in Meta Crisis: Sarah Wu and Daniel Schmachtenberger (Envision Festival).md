[[music]] i'll admit i'm a little nervous um you know sometimes when you're in the presence of like highly intelligent people you start to like you feel a little dumb thank you so much for that even though i know i'm also an intelligent person and still you get that little bit of an ego trip so thank you i think everybody here probably knows that sarah runs pretty much the [27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=27.24s)

whole programming and the whole curriculum and so it's a huge honor that you did the dialogue with me directly thank you yeah you know i i really love um being afraid actually maybe it's because i'm a pisces maybe it's i'm a little emo um but i think that when we push ourselves to small micro does of fear uh which we call in [[permaculture]] the edge we talk about that a lot um is [52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=52.879s)

this is where we actually grow and this is where we adapt and this is where we learn to be resilient and we realize what some of our our limits are as well as what some of our strengths are so thank you for helping to cultivate that and myself um on the topic uh i have a really hard time actually focusing when there's ambient noise so we will struggle with related [77](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=77.36s)

things together yeah that's good that's good in our awkwardness we present ourselves to you um so the title of this talk is an interesting one and we'll we'll see where we go we have a lot of talking points but we also wanted to just dialogue because that really is so much of the gift of our humanity is this ability to communicate to abstract [101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=101.6s)

concepts and to share in in the moment in the beautiful present moment the title of this talk was thoughts on psychological orientation to a world in [[metacrisis]] right we we gave it this really headyy title right um and it is a very important topic when we think about our our metac crisis that we're having but we can't even really fully understand what metac crisis means [129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=129.319s)

until we define more and more of what's happening in the world and what you were saying is like we don't want to reduce things right like i'm an herbalist i'm a [[permaculture]] it's like reductionist thinking um is useful right like we see that as a tool it's a tool of modern science and modern you know philosophical belief belie we also know how dangerous reductionism is um but [150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=150.519s)

we're holistic thinkers right we really see that there's this big picture out there that there's everything is interconnected like i said we aren't we aren't anything without all of you and in many ways your experience isn't anything without us and all of you together and so in that interconnection thinking about [[metacrisis]] i feel like we do have to start to weed through and [175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=175.519s)

reduce a little bit in how we even create definitions for what things like meta means or what crisis means and when i was reading about you you know you're talking about you being a civilization designer which is a heavy load to carry and what when we think about designing a civilization i'm thinking of millennia of influence that we have in the world and that we're [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=203.879s)

participating in the world and so what does even civilization if we could start to weed through that as we're creating the new world anyone out here use the new world paradigm in your vernacular you can do a straight elbow i know you do right so what does it mean to even think about civilization there's so many things that you said that i kind of want to address [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=229.599s)

like um i actually really rigorously avoid using terms like civilization designer uh i'll say it's a your bio it says it's a topic i'm interested in that's a distinction uh i don't think anyone can do civilization design but i think thinking through what viable civilizational structures would be is an important thing to do while also recognizing the [256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=256.12s)

limits of our capacity to do it i think so there's a problem with the term civilization i'll i'll speak to that but first there's a problem with terms right as you were speaking about reductionism and words so when lau thought of what he would start the da a jing with the first thing to say was the da that is speakable is not the eternal da and i wrote a poem a few years ago [283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=283.4s)

called the [[dance]] of the da and the 10,000 things and it it asks like is an adom real and it's like kind of like kind of an adam is real the way we define it and very pragmatic atically we can do a lot of chemistry very reliably but when we define the atom we don't include in the definition of the atom the electromagnetic field without which it wouldn't exist or the strong force without which it wouldn't exist or the higs field without which it wouldn't exist or the star that supernova to make it so the atom definition takes for granted a whole universe of reality without which it wouldn't exist right and so this is true for every word and so concepts are useful and there is error embedded in everyone all [334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=334.84s)

the way down to error embedded in every word and this is actually pretty critical to the metac crisis because i think everybody here knows that both [[climate change]] is both a really big deal and carbon reductionism is a problem it's possible to over focus on how we reduce carbon in ways that underfocus on biodiversity it and [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans and nitrogen run off and a lot of [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=360.68s)

other things but it's not just carbon right it's any metric if we talk about number of trees planted like the concept of a tree is a problem because of 2,000 year old tree and 100y old tree and trees that have totally different genetics like all of that's lost as soon as you make a concept that you can make a metric about that you can do large scale [387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=387.36s)

optimis a of but to do large scale you can't include all the nuance so inherent to being able to scale is the reduction of information is the externalities associated so when you think about the thou sh create no graven images and no false idols the way i think about that is that models of reality are false idols if you take them to be reality right any any model of human [413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=413.72s)

psychology of how ecosystems work work of fundamental physics uh has some utility to it but is not true with a capital t and to the degree that we get over excited about it make it true of the capital t where the model of reality is different than reality if we optimize for that model is where we end up harming reality so there needs to be some capacity to perceive [436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=436.759s)

reality not through the lens of what we already know as important right im immediate or non-mediated direct sensing of what's out of conceptual frameworks right and when we talk about things like the error in the word right the word becomes the pure truth at some points and what we do is with the word is we create an identity around that word and then the framework of that identity [465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=465.039s)

loses its permeability right it's something like akin to a geopolitical border like uh i'm sarah or you're daniel or this is en vision festival and we do see there's some type of a order and we see my skin and we see your skin but what we know is that there's this huge energetic exchange there's a microbiome flying all around us there's electromagnetic field all these things [488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=488.28s)

right that's moving in between us and so the word being so powerful the word being spells that we're creating that we become so stuck on is actually so dangerous and it's one of i feel our gifts of our human reality is that we're able to do this you know and it's also our our largest limitation yeah it's where you want to think about the models in terms of their usefulness you want to run lots of different models that seem to emphasize different things maybe even conflict with each other and you want to hold them all with some lightness and you want to hold in terms of the no false idols you want to hold your relationship to what is sacred as fundamentally unm modelable unmeasurable non optimizable so a corollary of the dow that is speakable is not the eternal dow is the metric set that is optimizable is not the right metric set which is the core issue with ai and ai alignment which is now probably the fastest emerging issue that the world faces is the issue of a gii alignment generalized [[artificial intelligence]] is is it if there's something that can [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=566.279s)

optimize for a goal set very very powerfully very rapidly so rapidly and powerfully that once it's doing that we can't change it is there any goal set that you can give it that is good and the it's a complex topic but i would say simply the answer is no right there's no [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=587.959s)

finitely describable computable goal set that you would want to optimize infinitely because and we see this with the the the good measure of a life is gdp well obviously gdp is not a good measure of reality because it can go up from war and addiction and sickness and lots of things like that so then you say well gdp plus a genie coefficient plus carbon [612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=612.8s)

and that still doesn't include biodiversity and so you add more metrics there will always be some stuff that is in the real particularly in the unknown unknown set that is not in the metric set that is being optimized for this is true for ai it's also true for markets it's also true for any kind of optimization process so i don't want to infinitely optimize any finitely [638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=638.92s)

described thing which is why we want some relationship to reality that is outside of description and we and ultimately the sacred is bound to a direct sensing that is transotic not reducible to symol outside of description i have the image comes in of looking through the eyes of a child you know and how that little one is constantly asking why and [663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=663.12s)

why but why but why and if you've ever experienced that with young ones or even of ourselves you know we stop asking we want to ask why and then we feel we have to keep finding the answers find the answer find the answer but when they're the little ones and they keep taking us down that hole they challenge us to remember that we we can actually know everything right there and so to create [686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=686.04s)

attempt to create metrics for everything is kind of pushing beyond maybe what is the the sacred mystery of our reality you know and trying to metric everything and optimizing everything is inherently um an exploitive capitalistic model right which is going in many ways which comes into the reality of the known civilization that we're living in right now and that everything has some type of [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=714.6s)

value that needs to be exploited in some way there's a value added product in every single ecosystem or within every single person that we see and so we got to optimize that make it the best pull it out of them put them into a leadership conference again and again right get more life coaches to tell them that they're you know how they can optimize thems for like the whole [735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=735.6s)

concept of biohacking and all these things you know so when i think about that what also comes up for me is in our [[permaculture]] philosophies the ethic of fair share was originally um taught as setting limits yields abundance and as we were talking earlier about that like that how does that scale and how does that interact with our human impulse control which we were you were all [762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=762.16s)

talking about the previous conversation what do you got to say about that how you make something healthy and how you make it scale are usually um at conflict with each other to be able to make something scale like in a in a small scale context everyone who's involved can uh be involved in the decision- making [795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=795.839s)

consensus obviously does not scale in the same way um being able to talk about all the nuance and the difference between this exact tree and this other tree you can't do that at scale and so you reduce things to metrics you apply technology that optimizes for some things at the expense of other things so this is this is where i think a lot of the focus on small scale is both [818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=818.48s)

valuable and misguided because it won't address the problems of large scale unless it understands why it doesn't scale and if it wants to actually deal with the biosphere it's like there's a stat something to the effect of china poured as much concrete in the last 2 years as the us poured in the the entire 20th century that's a huge thing to [840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=840.199s)

understand and there is no such thing as um addressing [[climate change]] or addressing the health of the oceans at a country level right let alone at a local eco community level and so uh i think it's important if if someone is trying to think about is a smaller scale higher touch solution to some of the problems they see in the world is it a solution that can address issues at scale in time [868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=868.399s)

or not and just at least be realistic about that one thing i was thinking is you just said um inherent to the that that kind of reductionism is implicit in capitalism it is but it's not unique to capitalism like communism metrifit things and tried to optimize metric sets capitalism is just the most effective system but in a world where to [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=892.12s)

fill defense budgets we do a bunch of quantitative easing it's hard even call that capitalism in the same way right it's not a market function when you subsidize radically um people can all the problems of the world or many of them can happen even with good intent this is a thing that i would like to address is it's fundamentally easier to solve a problem than it is to ensure that your solution to that problem doesn't cause other problems it's easier in kind not just motivationally but epistemologically thought wise cuz if i'm defining my problem like whatever it is i want to bring co2 down or i want to help the top soil in this area or i want to help [941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=941.48s)

economic development for these people i the solution i'm going to create will be a technology a company a law that is trying to directly solve that problem as defined and so i'm trying to create a first order effect on a small number number of known measures right co2 or the gdp per capita of these poor people or the whatever it is but because [964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=964.0s)

whatever i create is going to interact with [[social system|social systems]] and ecologies and economies that are complex it's going to have effect on other things it's going to have second third fourth order effects on a lot of unknown things so to try to prevent the harm from a particular activity requires nth order calculation on a very large unknown set of things whereas to just build the [989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=989.6s)

thing is first order effects on a small number of things so it is there's an asymmetry it's radically easier to solve narrowly defined problems than to define the problem well enough and come up with a solution that doesn't do that there's also an asymmetry in the [[game theory]] that those who focus on the opportunity more and the risk less get first mover advantage [1013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1013.759s)

and get capital and get power and then when the problems happen they say we couldn't have known and socialize the losses the people who are focused on maybe we should slow down with ai or with synthetic bio or whatever it is if they can't slow everyone else down and they're more authentically focused on risk they just lose the capital opportunities lose first moover [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1033.439s)

advantage and still don't address the thing so um it is important to understand that you have these asymmetries independent of of problematic intention it's interesting thinking about intention and specifically what you were bringing up is measurable actions and reactions and [1059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1059.6s)

inherently we're talking about our [[social system|social systems]] and our relationships right with each other with the world with our concepts of fairness and justice our concepts of divinity these types of things and what are the effects of these belief systems of these actions and trying to quantify them and all these things and how good intent we create different types of it [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1087.72s)

was a word that our friend elor the other day in his talk used it is we create aliis for our good intent which i thought was really a profound thing to to acknowledge and in our good intent and starting on the scales that feel attainable to us you because you're such a a macro thinker but for many of us in audience it's really difficult to see things from the macro scale because [1115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1115.44s)

we're so wrapped up in our own worlds sometimes that like looking outside of ourselves it's like so heavy you know or if we start to inform ourselves about what's happening to other people around the world it's devastating on the soul level you know when we look at situations like in iran for example that's what feel feels most passionate to me right now is the female movement [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1139.08s)

there that's happening you know and i feel powerless to it but where i do feel power powerful is in situations like this where i feel powerful is in those micro attempts at creating fairness and justice within communal systems and so when we're looking say community we talk about things like consensus and it's hard it's really hard it's hours and hours and hours and hours and days and [1168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1168.88s)

days and days of processing to finally say that we all agree on if it should be pizza or pasta right like the simple things we'll sit there and debate about as as human beings because our consensus is so often rooted in personal opinion is that how do we then if we if we can't scale consensus what we're inherently seeing is that what is scalable are things that are punitive in nature like [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1196.32s)

punishable by nature and that so then we're operating in fear-based systems that are saying if we don't do something based on this governance structure that says this is how it's supposed to be we're going to be harmed physically mentally emotionally financially in our resources etc etc so you know like what is you know how do we make sense this is some of the um suggestions from a mutual [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1219.799s)

friend who told was telling me about you she's like ask him how to make sense of things right cu it's really easy to keep talking about like the grand the big scary picture of it all and the devastation of it all and so how do we make sense of these small scale systems in relationship to power over systems that are like boulders and we're ants against [1245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1245.44s)

it how do we make sense how do we increase our agency to be able to affect things that are devastating if we feel and if we don't feel like we have any agency we kind of can't stay with um i this what was this there was one more part of it was talking about scaling if [1273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1273.919s)

consensus doesn't work what seems to work are power over systems of governance that are inherently punitive in their nature one first part about how to make better sense of things is seek the most well-informed contradictory perspectives to the ones you currently hold and really study them um that i love breaking apart your [1300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1300.799s)

echo chamber if you're always reading news that validates your belief systems you're not growing and you're not evolving well so this is one of the things about the devastation is there's a lot of it's a very natural process to seek security through certainty and to be really uncomfortable with things that are maybe catastrophically critical to the world where your best answer is i [1327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1327.48s)

have no idea that's actually hard right it's hard to sit and i have no idea to something that really matters and i should know how to orient to and to feel certain about it and to feel like i know what team to side with like not only is that a very easy emotion and process to empathize with it's an easy one for all competing power systems to exploit in people well [1348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1348.96s)

because when we put each other into teams we're inherently becoming hyper competitive right instead of because we're creating that identity that doesn't have a permeability to it right and that this is just it and like this is the truth right here whereas when we look into the forest ecosystems or we look to animals they're territorial in nature and those territories are in [1371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1371.48s)

their nature of fluid right and so that right there starts to break that apart if we stop seeing each other as teams and that we start to see each other more as interconnected collaborative partners that sometimes swap around you know that we have um very polycultural relationships with each other yeah and as you already acknowledged even friends living [1397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1397.64s)

together in a eco village might take 3 days to come to see each other's collaborators and not enemies when it comes to really trivial seeming that their ego gets stuck on which has nothing to do with like israel palestine or great power plays or things like that so um the actual practice of seeing who is easiest to otherize villainize and really seek to [1420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1420.76s)

understand their perspective in a non-pejorative way is a hard practice it's a necessary practice the better you are at it the better you can be at actually influencing um non-conflict solutions or how higher order solutions to lots of things so one one thing i'd say is um your current best understanding of most anything how [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1443.12s)

to deal with [[climate change]] thesis extinction fake news whatever is orders of magnitude insufficient for what the right answer actually is to acknowledge that means to step into really radical uncertainty about something you care about it's easier to be like i don't know that's not my topic in bail or to feel some certainty or to at least find someone else that seems [1466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1466.039s)

has certainty and you can align with and none of those are adequate right because the really smart person that has certainty totally gets into fights with someone else who's as smart who has certainty about conflicting things and so and sometimes they just don't have the epistemic flexibility to see it another way because they spent their whole career working on one strategy [1485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1485.679s)

sometimes they have deep investments in that right so and it goes into false idols right and elevating people into these positions where that's what i believe and i'm going to hold them to that no matter what they say sometimes it's false idols it's also just cognitive offloading right when there's huge complexity and when it's hard to make sense of the world it becomes [1512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1512.2s)

easier to want to def default to somebody else's thinking and it's actually true that we cannot make sense of the total complexity of all the things which is why we have a model of institutions that are supposed to be trustworthy author ities to do that the challenge is that the moment an institution whether it was a church or a scientific institution has the perceived [1536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1536.399s)

legitimate authority on what is true there's a lot of power to being the legitimate authority on what's true so power starts seeking to influence that which is why there are very few institutions that the whole world currently in extreme partisan um divide accept as true and that's actually fair it's not just crazy people on the right it's that there is massive institutional [1557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1557.48s)

bias so the it's just i the thing i want to bring up is that there's an adaptive valley between where you currently are and where you could be effective that is really uncomfortable and it feels like tuning your attention to things you care about that you don't think you can do anything about and feeling the devastation of that without an answer because if you're if you can pay [1580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1580.2s)

if you can be aware of what's happening in iran or [[factory farm|factory farms]] or turkey or haiti and then just totally go back to just being focused on living your best life ever and killing it and not being bothered by that like there's something wrong with you to not be at all devastated in a world where there's so much devastation means a kind of sociopathic level of dissociation [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1605.72s)

exactly and what we were talking about in our conversation earlier is despair and how the power over and the realities of the world and the powerlessness our lack of agency in our lives leads us to really deep despair which then eventually and parallely right brings us also into really deep rooted states of apathy and for me the greatest soul sickness that we share as human beings [1631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1631.6s)

in the world right now is apathy is that we don't care enough about what's happening to the other and if we are all connected to the world's soul and we are all connected to each other in every single way possible if you're suffering i am suffering no matter what and it doesn't matter how much i do if others are suffering out of proportion to those of us that are thriving it's going to [1656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1656.399s)

keep causing that despair and that apathy and that harm right we don't care enough in the world and so how do we make sense of that yeah so when you were saying that you think about the issue women are facing in iran it's devastating but you don't know what you can do about it if you tried to understand the issue continuously for a few months you would be able to do [1678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1678.799s)

about it but i have been thinking about it for months and i don't feel like i have i can do about it so that's the thing like seeing 12-year-old girls being beat up in the street for trying to walk alone i don't feel like can do anything about it instantly you can't right you can see that video and feel devastated you can't do anything instantly but if you you [1702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1702.48s)

actually have the ability to reach out to people who are on the ground and get more intel from them that is a an upside of technological capability you have an ability to start to then identify who are people that have more levers of power there and like in your network here there are people who know the us ambassador and the un ambassador to iran you could totally get them in a medicine ceremony you could totally actually have a deep conversation and start to figure out path ways of influence but it does take feeling those feelings not knowing what to do about them and then seeking to understand that you don't normally try to understand like who has political power in the situation so it's actually this [1747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1747.399s)

the important thing is one has to lean into feeling the devastation and stay there and lean into not knowing the answer and stay there as the training to then get the capabilities to start to have progressively more competent answers it's like those moments when you lean in to stay there right it's the moment where you feel the most uncomfortable in it whether it's in [1769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1769.48s)

whatever routine or practice you have or even we were talking about the effects of the phone you know it's like even setting that aside you get like that twitch of i want to look i want to look what's happening you know or the moments when you're in the forest and being silent and sitting and you feel uncomfortable with the life that's around you and all the things that you [1789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1789.6s)

feel like you have to do that are important in your world and then when you really start to sit there is when when and ease and lean into the uncomfortableness is when you start to see all the life around you i just got really loud you start to see all that life around you and you start to feel so deeply interconnected with it all and [1811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1811.039s)

seeing that your life in some ways is everything and nothing at once yeah so you take the you were mentioning the relationship between despair and apathy and despair is way better than apathy apathy is um an escape from pain that you don't feel like you can deal with through agency right so if i'm if i'm feeling [1838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1838.44s)

despair it's because something i care about is being harmed and i'm feeling that but underneath it the source of it is care right if i didn't love or care about if you didn't love those women if you didn't care about their if you didn't find something sacred and beautiful beautiful about their life you wouldn't give any shits about it right so the despair is actually an expression [1860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1860.399s)

of what you find beautiful meaningful sacred and that you love it's what the fear is about too right the fear and anxiety is about that things that you find sacred will be harmed the anger is also about the same thing it's that something that you find sacred beautiful meaningful is being harmed and you're looking at who's doing it so if you trace all those emotions [1878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1878.84s)

back to their source is what is actually sacred to me that i want to be in service to and then you realize if the despair shuts my agency down it's actually not an ethical thing i can indulge cuz this love actually requires me to be as effective as i can be and so i find that there's a transformation if i take what i'm afraid of and i trace it [1904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1904.12s)

back to what is it that i care about that i don't want to have be harmed and i really tune into the sacredness there and then i say how can i be most in service i get like i it's something that's more like careful than fearful the anger turns into like impassioned action the despair turns into both grief and awe and motivation and the apathy is actually even we can [1929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1929.679s)

empathize with it in ourself and others it's an overwhelm at pain that we don't know how to deal with but the answer is actually more figuring out how to have agency more so we can stay with the feelings rather than turn them off and i feel like some of the agency is actually the choice and how we work with our feelings and how we let them sometimes cause ourselves harm cause others harm [1954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1954.039s)

based on how we feel and so that first step in agency is acknowledging the feelings that we're having processing through them and what also comes up for me which was such a profound um moment in my reality coming from like that catholic wounding which i bet a lot of you have out there right and acknowledging things like witch wound and um stepping into you know personal [1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=1978.88s)

power embodied power and agency was realizing that holy places aren't places with identities and they aren't places that are held by the few but it's actually in every single step we take and that the holy ground is right beneath your feet right now everywhere that we're we're moving through the world and in you know that holy of the ground and that holy step it's [2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2008.159s)

reminding us that that is sacred to me and that everything in life is sacred to me so it's like if we can come into that place and this is what i love so much about um modern witchcraft and that movement is exactly that because it's the decentralization specifically of power in relationship to what is divine and what is sacred and what is holy yeah i really like this we were [2034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2034.159s)

saying ear earlier that with all of the not just risks of what will happen but the active tragic things that are happening currently if someone doesn't feel regular heartbreak there's something wrong right and if someone doesn't feel regular awe at the sacred there's something wrong because both are always parts of reality right one of my favorite quotes is by joanna macy i keep [2059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2059.159s)

it on my altar um and it says the heart that breaks open can contain the entire universe and so i feel like the more and more and more we allow ourselves to move into that suffering and through that despair and into that like deep well of sadness for the world and grieving for the world that's a lot of her work as well you know the more and more we can cultivate that care and that empathy and [2084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2084.639s)

that like unconditional love for life right that's the a philosophical core of biophilia when when you were talking about that there's an unc comfort when you're sitting in the jungle i was i was thinking of medicine journeys whether it's with medicine or it's division quest or and there like there's almost none of them that are meaningful that don't [2109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2109.359s)

involve moving through intense discomfort right and being able to kind of there's something about intense discomfort that is associated with the expansion of the capacity of a being and so one can take their emotional response to the state of the world as a medicine and hold that whole thing as a sacred path to be like okay i want to [2131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2131.119s)

lean into it to grow where i can both love more and respond to the love more effectively and whatever like difficult iasa like journey is required of me to do that that's what i'm here to do we're coming to time wow i love this so much weh gosh we only really have like five minutes left time flies and it crawls all at the same time um daniel i'm so [2163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2163.04s)

honored to have this conversation with you and to sit here and for you to share with us and for you to you know bring your gifts to envision and thank you so much for your humility and your kindness and your openness and your flexibility and your brilliance thank you for the work that you do in the world you for making the space to be and inviting me you're welcome you're so [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2187.96s)

welcome any final perhaps thoughts that you want to leave our audience with as we move into closing out this event as we move into our our final night as people break through this one reality into all the other spectrums of reality that we exist on as we go out into the world why you want to leave us with if you're feeling feeling right now you might not be but if you're feeling [2217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2217.52s)

any sense of like increased seriousness but also increased sacredness increased desire that the thoughts words and deeds that you engage with matter more to life like tattoo it on your hand or anytime after a journey that you feel that sense of increased meaningfulness figure out how to remind yourself of that all the time [2245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2245.0s)

because we are distractable beings and we can get way more absorbed and pissed off at like the person that did some minor wrong to us in a business transaction than it like warlords killing lots of people cuz we're just too tiny in our focus we just get distracted so the you're the average of the five people you spend the most time around there's truth to that [2266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2266.48s)

consciously change who you're around to align with the thoughts you want to be thinking about the things you want in your awareness to cultivate who you are consciously change the information streams coming in because the most amazing sator state shifts people have don't mean for their life a couple years later did you just forget it and go back to the other [2292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2292.0s)

stuff like the things that usually end up mattering those states matter only in so far as it translates to changes in the continuous input so figure out how to do something in this moment that will remind you to to change the continuous input that aligns your life moment to moment with what matters most to you more thank you so much daniel thank you everybody everybody [2320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcKjSb_h3uk&t=2320.72s)

applause daniel thank you thank you thank you
