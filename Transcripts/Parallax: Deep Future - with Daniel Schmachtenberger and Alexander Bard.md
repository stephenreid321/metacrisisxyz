all right uh welcome to parallax i'm your host thoma mark with me today are daniel schmuckenberger and alexander bart denis martenberger is a social philosopher and founding member of the consilience project aimed at providing public [[sensemaking]] and improving public [[sensemaking]] a dialogue alexander bart is [24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=24.32s)

amongst many other things the philosopher author and futurologist i'm very happy to bring you both together for the first time so welcome both of you um the goal and the idea of this conversation is in short to kind of generate [40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=40.559s)

a snapshot of where we are 2022 ideologically politically economically and technologically and where we are headed to the end of the decade so where are we now in this time between worlds and what are the possible and probable outcomes of our current trajectories we are facing a crisis while at the same time our institutions [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=64.479s)

do not seem to fit or able to solve these problems it appears that the climate crisis unfolding right now and the war is brewing the cultural divide and the western hemisphere the culture war is getting more intense and at the same time our myths and narratives don't work anymore the postmodern policies of deconstructions [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=84.799s)

have for better or worse negated our way of reducing complexity so where are we now is the west going to fall as oswald wrangler once put it is the chaos going to increase till we find a new way of life or is it as it ever was men struggling to find meaning in a complex world can digital provide us with the means to reconstruct the [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=107.28s)

myth and narrative and maybe more on the point at what point does it become wiser to acknowledge that it's too late to stop anything and turn our efforts to surviving it so daniel if if you had to start to paint this broad painting where we are right now when where are we now when you were to take [127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=127.36s)

up a systemic bird's eye view of things i tried to paint a brief hopefully useful starting place picture you were saying you know we're in a global crisis and you gave a few examples um i often use the term [[metacrisis]] um that is not just looking at the fact that we have uh [[climate change]] and biodiversity loss and extinction of species and [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans and topsoil loss and all those environmental issues or that we have increasing fragility and [[supply chain|supply chains]] or the problem of [[exponential growth]] on the financial system in linear [[materials economy]] hitting fragility on [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] or the ai risk biorisk cyber risk issues that new exponential technologies create like all of these are possibly [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] and we're in this interesting situation where the total number of [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] is increasing and the probability of them is increasing and so rather than just see each of those as different separate ones or certain underlying drivers that we can look at that they had in common talk about the [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[catastrophic risk]] and um so we would say that we are at a [204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=204.239s)

unique point in history something where alexander and i definitely agree is it it's not just processes of the same thing always under the sun being able to extinct species that scale and genetically engineer new species and synthetic biology is a different thing that was true two thousand or twenty thousand years ago um and so the first truly existential tech we had in terms of technology enough that we could make choices that uh damage the habitability of the world was the nuclear bomb and that was so recent in historical time we built an entire [[world system]] to prevent using tech that tech and we had never done that before every tech we had we always made an [[arms race]] to use as fast as we could now we built a whole [[world system]] that involved mutual assault destruction and the [[bretton woods]] monetary system and the u.n igo systems to ensure not doing that while that succeeded in a way it also [259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=259.12s)

drove all the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] we're facing now and to more likely to like let's have a monetary system that increases exponential uh gdp so everybody can have more without taking each other's stuff on linear [[supply chain|supply chains]] that externalize cost to the environment pushing all the [[planetary boundary]] issues and you can make [[mutually assured destruction]] on two superpowers with one [[catastrophe weapon]] but you can't on lots and lots of non-state actors all having access to different kinds of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] so how do you deal with that so we're in a situation where the post-world war ii world is over there's a lot more [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] and those types of solutions don't work and we need new ones what we'd say is that there's so like whether we're talking about the risk from a particular kind of ai or bio or nuclear or [[climate change]] refugees leading to nuclear whatever it is there's the increasing catastrophe attractor right there's like an [311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=311.28s)

attractive basin defined by we can't manage our power well [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] create increasing catastrophes there's a thousand scenarios but they're all kind of the catastrophe tractor then there's this other tractor that says in order to manage those we must be able to monitor and control adequately and that looks like pretty powerful centralized [329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=329.68s)

control mechanisms which mostly turn pretty dystopic so we can make sure that nobody builds uh [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] in their basement using tabletop crispr if we have ubiquitous surveillance and extremely powerful control mechanisms then that becomes pretty dystopic so there's like catastrophes and dystopias as these two different detractors and [[exponential tech]] makes both more likely you can run much more powerful top-down systems using ai and iot you can also create a lot worse catastrophic dynamics with [[exponential tech]] so we want a [[third attractor]] that is neither dystopic nor catastrophic and that means that it has to have the capacity to check all of the power that could cause catastrophe on purpose or [371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=371.84s)

accident but where that system that checks it must also have checks and balances and be oriented in a life that is somehow desirable and so how do we make make it through the [[metacrisis]] means make it through the catastrophes and the dystopias uh to some kind of [[third attractor]] what are the criteria of that attractor um [390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=390.96s)

that would be a fine starting point of kind of where i see that we're at in the arc of history and um music that that quote in the book of romans something like the path to hell is uh wide and many the path to heaven is narrow and steep [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=410.4s)

it's easy to come up with dystopian sci-fi because humans have been pretty nasty stewards of power historically and the idea of us having decentralized exponential power like there's just a lot of bad scenarios the idea of exponential power ai and genetic engineering or whatever going well with people like us running [429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=429.68s)

it requires some pretty significantly new thought and so how do we come up with a positive future narrative that is not a naive silly one um i think this is the topic it'd be fun to have us explore today that's my kind of initial frame i can then add to that that uh the the reason why i got really interested in [452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=452.8s)

daniel's brain a few years ago was that i was very alone being of loss of road technology for quite a long time and it was really required obviously we live in the middle of a technological revolution here was a guy who was even more a philosopher of technology than i was which is great so we it it's kind of shocking that this is actually probably the first recording [471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=471.68s)

of conversation between us because we've been friends for many years now and i highly respect daniel's work and i'm very excited about this conversation so i just want to say that first when i add to this is that um i'm a narcologist so here's a new word right please recall that the 20th century was was mostly uh used for deconstruction you know after the atomic bomb august [493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=493.68s)

the 6th 1945 the most important date in recent history for all of us on the planet like i i agree completely here with daniel let's use that date there's a certain date there august 6 1945 it helps us to to locate ourselves historically and after that date uh deconstruction became the natural norm it's just like we have to deconstruct all of history we've only begun that [515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=515.519s)

process we have to deconstruct western history of the world right now that's happening we have people all over the world who realize that there's a myth about asia that is completely incorrect there's a myth about africa that's completely incorrect and also america is finally shifting america is not it's not european any longer america is now the meeting place of the world populated [535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=535.839s)

from peop by people from all over the world and american english is the new standard language of the world that we all use to communicate so even america is shifting in the sense that america is becoming truly a global meeting place today and that's what's really interesting here so i do narratology narratology is more than deconstruction [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=552.959s)

it's also reconstruction it's basically the philosophical uh the philosophical search for the narratives that human beings tell about themselves we are storytelling animals we're storytelling flock animals so we tell stories about ourselves all the time and fundamentally these these stories have to be split into three different types of stories so let let me follow you into this one the [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=575.68s)

first one is precisely the one where daniel is an expert it's what we call the logos this is how reality actually operates and how we symbolically try to understand how the world operates for example mathematics you know when language tries to be exact that's when we go into the logos the second one is pathos you know every [593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=593.36s)

time somebody tells you do it once more with feeling it's like add the pathos please you're a human being right you're not a machine you do you do it you you need to add the pathos to what you do so pathos is is the storytelling that's usually banned banned from children's use just like i said that pornography violence all of that is located in the pathos and the third one is the mythos and the mythos is the only way for the other two to be combined so our predicament as both hegel and nietzsche pointed out in the 19th century is that the only way for us to have some kind of a narrative that we can share is to create mythos not myth but a mythos here so these are the three basic stories and they are [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=635.6s)

dialectically intertwined you cannot focus on one of them rather than the other one and then if you look at power and domination it goes to say that power domination goes into these three realms so the logos is the symbolic order uh and the symbolic it's more on the masculine side of things if you allow us to say that but it's more the masculine side of [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=656.079s)

things and the logos how the world actually operates zeros and ones today more than anything is the logos and and then that is logos is presented as knowledge the power through knowledge whatever's access to knowledge today would say data and data processing whoever has control over the knowledge or say dominates in the knowledge field has enormous power [676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=676.64s)

and influence and that's of course we need to start today the other one is violence itself who has the monopoly of violence over specific territory that's state and things like that and that that is the pathos so that's the second realm and the path of what we call the real order the real order of things is ultimately the physical world out there that we if you [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=695.2s)

walk straight into a wall and hit your head you you just you just encounter the path of the world out there we can fantasize all we like and we human beings fantasize individually collectively all the time but at the end of the day our fantasies will be crushed and they will be crushed by what's called the pathos [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=712.16s)

so that's the second real the real word the third one the only one that can unite the other two is the imaginary order imaginary word is tied to the mythos so we imagine the world and this is where it gets important we have to have an imaginary that makes sense to us we have to have a shared imagine if you're going to share a [729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=729.04s)

society and that's where the crisis at so what's happening right now i would propose is that this is a paradigm shift in the sense that we're moving into the online world and the internet is taking over the world and we're globalized because the internet itself goes towards globalization whereas we human beings are very local in our attitude towards [746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=746.639s)

the world so the this one this was that's a paradigm shift so why there's a messed up crisis tied to the paradigm shift is that all these three narratives are in crisis at the same time daniel is the perfect guy in the world right now to list the reason why logos is in crisis that's exactly what he's talking about after 1945 we've discovered that we're [766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=766.72s)

exploiting the world towards our own extinction and that's that's not a small thing to say that's exactly what we're doing we could blow ourselves up with the bomb we could also blow ourselves up in many other ways and just take more time that's what the logos crisis at the problem is the other two aspects are in crisis too the pathos the pathos is in crisis the mythos is a [788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=788.0s)

crisis the mythos is in crisis in a very particular way it's a crisis in the religious or the spiritual and therefore also political manner death has become the absolute we now have an elite in the world today who believe they really will die when they die that has never happened before in history we have always excused ourselves with an afterlife or at least with a [807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=807.839s)

reincarnation a reincarnation of the east of the afterlife of the west we have always had those myths before now we can no longer have a myth and therefore we cannot have a myth that is utopian or dystopian either we have to accept that we die and we die and the only thing that can transcend us is children who inherit earth after we're gone [828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=828.079s)

we're into that mode that we have now elite in the world that have come to accept that and they're dealing with it massively and it's not a small thing at all when it's dealt with collectively this is like nietzsche's the last man that's where we're located right now so there's a crisis in in the mythos 2 there's a crisis in storytelling we can deconstruct as much as we like but if we [847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=847.279s)

don't reconstruct something valuable to us and have a new story we're done and the third one is the crisis and the pathos this is the crisis of violence this is the crisis of sexuality but this is also the crisis of nature itself that's not catching up with us this is the crisis of the bomb it's literally physical this is the crisis of the climate it's literally [868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=868.16s)

physical therefore there's a crisis in the pathos too so all the three different narratives are in crisis all the three different narratives simultaneously have to be retold as a new shared neurotrology that makes sense to us that's why there's a metal crisis can i ask you to um just clarify a bit for what has to happen in logos in pathos [890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=890.88s)

and mythos like is there something like what you would think of as necessary and sufficient criteria of the new logos the new mythos and the new pathos that converges towards a [[third attractor]] yeah absolutely um the [[third attractor]] we call protopianism and i think it was kelly over at wired who invented the term or maybe it's been around because it sounds a bit generic but uh [914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=914.72s)

protopianism when i came to east asia and you travel there too down in a lot like when i talk to the japanese the korean and the chinese it doesn't make sense to say anything today that they don't get or they don't subscribe to and it certainly makes a lot of sense to listen to them and their history right uh because we share a world with them now uh protopianism makes sense to anybody in east asia the utopian dystopian dichotomy was always western and we got it from abrahamic religion it doesn't make sense in india it doesn't make sense in china or japan but the protopian perspective which is the incremental improvement and work towards optimization of processes makes sense that makes sense globally so i would start with saying that all these different narratives now have to be protopian we need to get rid of the utopian to drive towards the token and the dystopian which is what you call the [[third attractor]] which i think is brilliant the [[third attractor]] is now required because it's the only credible global narrative we can have and it goes [971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=971.759s)

for both the logos and the mythos and the pathos they all have to be protopian and you and i in one of our little night sessions over in california came up with the term that i love called symbiotic intelligence so i think we should we should ai is what the machines will do but as long as we human beings are involved in collaboration with the machines i think it makes more sense to [992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=992.24s)

speak of an si and essa is an ai ultimately controlled by humans serving our interests but that takes a lot of maturity from us as well to work with the symbiotic intelligence but if symbiotic intelligence is an intelligence that works towards optimization or process at all times and of course this is not an optimization of a process that's ultimately exploitative [1012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1012.399s)

that's why we use the term implotation in our work all the time you know and we talk about resilience sustainability of these things the implicative aspect has to be implemented within a protopin process meaning that you have to give back what you just used in that sense you cannot exploit the world any longer because it's the end of the story so employative means closed loop or real exactly employative is opposite to exploitative so it's easy to understand it's the opposite of that we used the word for the past 20 years and what's important here is that protopian ideals meaning that if you're an artist you go protopian if you're an engineer you go protopian if you start the company you should have a protopian company from day [1052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1052.48s)

one so the way to make incremental improvements on the world through your work which is how you do technology essentially once we've created the technology it's there and technology in itself is a pharmaco it can be it could be good or bad it can be hiroshima it can also be a fusion a pharmaco pharmakon means that a technology in itself is neutral it [1073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1073.679s)

depends on what we human beings do with it and in this sense of course atomic power is the perfect sample of a pharmacology so that's what technology technology itself should be neutral to us and then we ask ourselves the question how to use that technology to the benefit of mankind long-term was actually a [1092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1092.84s)

a funny point of intersection and um i wish that my schedule over the last week had been different i've got to read more of your uh recent work and share some things with you we actually just published a paper with consilience project called tech is not values neutral um like a few days ago so it's just [1111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1111.36s)

funny to come to this point it's um it's maybe an interesting topic for us to discuss because it doesn't map to the logos pathos methods perfectly but the um the infrastructure [[social structure]] [[superstructure]] way of looking at uh the domains of civilization and the fact that uh psyches and cultures are directly [1132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1132.72s)

affected by tech and it's not just what values we bring to it determines if it has a good or bad use it's that every technology is an extension of human choice making it catches on because it confers power and thus whoever uses it and gets more power usually ends up driving the beginning of a new [[arms race]] of some type that obligates other people to use it that codes a pattern of human behavior to use the tech as opposed to not coding that pattern of human behavior affects human psyches [[value system|value systems]] belief systems everything and then the distribution of that affects um cultures and societies so we [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1169.039s)

call this psychosocial externalities rather than physical externalities and so physical externalities we know the the pollution and the harm in the [[supply chain]] and whatever that occurs so we have to go physically closed loop meaning we're not using unrenewable physical resources or turning them into trash or pollution we have to go psychosocial closed loop [1187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1187.84s)

too um and it's not going to be closed up in the same way but it does mean forecast the psychosocial effects and internalize them into the design process because obviously something like the nature of the algorithm that optimizes for engagement which in optimizes for outrage which ends up [1209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1209.919s)

polarizing a society or shortening attention spans like these are very real effects on psyches in society so it's not fair to say tech is value is neutral tech was built to advance certain values like um ease and brevity and comfort and whatever it advances those it affects other values and it does so [1230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1230.159s)

at scale and so if you don't actually think about what are the values that are worth valuing and how do we build tech that enhances those then because the tech is so powerful it will end up damaging them and so you actually can't think about the evolution of culture independently from the techplex that ends up [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1248.96s)

determining what wins behaviorally i agree so the point here is that engineers have no clue what they're doing historically so like if you if you would have asked gutenberg about the [[printing press]] in 1415 it was quite an event when the [[printing press]] arrived i mean they started printing bibles quite quickly to start with and that was his point the point was that you should [1270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1270.0s)

translate the bible to local dialects around europe so the europeans could read the bible and become all the good catholics that he wanted them to be actually he created the end of the catholic church it's been it's been growing gradually but you know the whole question of the catholic church and now is just basically diminishing into nothing started with gutenberg he was [1286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1286.159s)

the killer of the catholic church he just didn't know so the problem is that engineers are usually historically speaking very unaware so i just want to remove the sort of the guilt applied to them afterwards like you don't even know what people do with you i mean nietzsche couldn't know that hitler would come along and marx couldn't know that stalin would come along you can't blame people [1304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1304.88s)

afterwards what people later are doing in the sense that we usually do so my point is this though that there's a social responsibility for creating an environment where technology is created in the first place the one thing we've learned is that we hardly change at all human beings are basically the same word say five or ten thousand years ago in the very short span to be created [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1324.96s)

civilization what we do create is technology the way i frame it is that i said women give birth to children men envy women for giving birth to children men therefore give birth to technology the problem is that if technology develops quicker than children do which tends to do its only question of time before [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1344.88s)

technology kills the child unless you intervene right so that's essentially the history of civilization in five sentences uh in a very freudian sense so my point in calling technology value neutral is of course nothing is value neutral in the formal sense but it is to point out that technologies are pharmaconic usually by by historical necessity and then we can [1367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1367.6s)

look at them today we know more and today the loops of technological innovation are so tight and involve so many people that the pathos of the mythos are obviously now involved in the loop of the logos itself we are really beginning to look at the word dialectically we're really beginning to look at the world these three narratives are now colliding one another we cannot [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1389.12s)

trust any one of them because as human beings we have to operate all three and we have to reform all three at the same time which is exactly why this is a [[metacrisis]] to solve yeah we have to do all three at the same time you and i totally agree on we're not looking at a theory of change we're looking at an ecosystem of theories of change an [1408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1408.32s)

ecosystem of projects that have a protopic direction to them have a [[third attractor]] attractive basin to them and the desire for what is like the comprehensive solution set or roadmap for humanity is us is based on the fallacy that a centralizing [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1426.96s)

intelligence could do that thing um so i think we think very much the same way about that uh it's interesting i want to try to tie a couple things together that you said you were mentioning that uh marx can't really be blamed for stalin and et cetera because people can't really forecast what's going to happen [1445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1445.6s)

afterwards einstein and the bomb great example um i think it's true that i was talking with a friend the other day about all of the like hopeful projects that are going to make the world better that didn't happen that he was kind of [1460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1460.32s)

traumatized by um and where their hope and how good they would be uh was false and i said yeah but you also need to equally factor all of the um devastatingly bad things that people forecasted during that time that didn't happen as well the cuban missile crisis didn't become world war three and y2k didn't in the world and 2012 didn't and on and on and that if you factor them [1480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1480.559s)

both people just suck at forecasting the future because it makes sense that we would we can't get the weather right 10 days out like multiple embedded [[complex system|complex systems]] are hard we're just not going to do that so we have to get recursive intelligence processes that can do a little bit and increase the [[collective intelligence]] they can keep doing that [1498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1498.64s)

that said i think there are some things we can do to forecast externalities much much much better than we ever have that are kind of low hanging and it's really worthwhile and so one thing as you're mentioning that the engineers i mean i think the engineers have been profoundly competent [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1515.84s)

in the domain that they were trained but as soon as you understand that technology codes patterns of behavior that end up coding minds that then in mass code societies of course technologists have to be trained in social sciences um and axiological design what are the [1531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1531.6s)

value sets that will emerge from the use of these technologies has to be a consideration doesn't mean you'll get it all right but we need to work at it and then recursively work at it and improve the process as we go so i think when you have bigger frameworks like that our [[superstructure]] right our collective definition of the good life [1548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1548.96s)

and values whatever our [[social structure]] our economics governance law agreement fields in our infrastructure or techplex co-influence each other so that you don't try to do [[sensemaking]] within one you do [[sensemaking]] across them just basic like that really helps right it really helps the forecasting [1564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1564.72s)

but one other thing i wanted to say is there's a very interesting thing right now where the argument that we can't possibly forecast the future well enough ends up being a source of [[plausible deniability]] for people not even trying where it's in their vested interest not to and the less wrong community have the this [1582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1582.72s)

blog post on uh is it [[mistake theory]] or [[conflict theory]] that's bigger deal meaning the [[mistake theory]] are the problems the result of we just couldn't have possibly known and the externalities are too complex or is it [[conflict theory]] meaning we actually wanted to cause that problem or we wanted the benefit and we didn't really care if we caused that problem and of [1599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1599.039s)

course it's some of both um but some of the argument in there is michael vasser and others commented is that the existence of the possibility of [[mistake theory]] serves as a [[plausible deniability]] cover for a bunch of [[conflict theory]] to hide itself and say oh we couldn't possibly [1616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1616.159s)

know no you didn't try because it wasn't in your interest yeah yeah i'm just thinking of like instagram wouldn't they have known that they would cause like a massive psychiatric health care crisis among teenage girls you and i pointed that out from the very beginning like just like they they couldn't know but they didn't want to hear it right because they were there [1635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1635.2s)

lanier was telling everybody at the time facebook was starting or whatever it's going to do these things they're like shut up hippie and no it's not there's no possible way but of course the motivated reasoning is is a problem right motivated is tricky so here's the piece that i wanted to add which is there's a very perverse piece of kind of [1651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1651.52s)

game theoretical incentive here that has to be bound which is that it is very disadvantageous in a market type dynamic for any individual or group to focus on what the possible risks might be and it's very out of the thing that they would develop and it's very advantageous to just focus on the opportunities and benefits [1670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1670.399s)

because if i do protracted risk assessment somebody else hits first mover advantage faster and if my protracted risk assessment says actually the field is too dangerous we shouldn't do it it's not going to stop the thing the market is going to move the people who move fastest will privatize the benefits and then socialize the losses and so there's a focus to move [1689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1689.039s)

fast break things socialize the losses nobody takes responsibility that perverse [[game theory]] keeps people from even trying to think well and when the worst harm you could do was add lead to gasoline which was pretty  bad right it decreased the iq of the planet by like a billion points and [1710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1710.24s)

made people four times more violent it's like jesus christ that's a huge deal when you say humans have been about the same for five thousand years i'm like no man  just let it gasoline alone made us a billion iq point stupider and four times more violent like that's a big deal that was one of 50 million chemicals in the in the chemical [1725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1725.679s)

database that was made but but when it comes to synthetic biology and general [[artificial intelligence]] by the time we're dealing with those types of externalities it is it's totalizing and so we actually have to do some fundamentally different types of coordination around how to think through the long [1746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1746.0s)

term better using models like attractive basins and things where you don't have to get every detail of [[complex system|complex systems]] right but you can get general principles and where you disincentivize move fast and break things and this is actually things like to open up a new category of tech you actually have to open up these you have to get [1763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1763.76s)

regulatory approval to open it up as opposed to regulate after the harms have already happened um that's of course that bothers everyone because they don't trust states to regulate so we have to also restructure the state from scratch because the power to check the catastrophes creates dystopias unless you also have strong bindings on it but [1780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1780.159s)

you have to face these things together yeah and that's where it gets interesting here with the narratology you just set the state here the state is in the imaginary it's not on the logical realms and imaginary so so we did inherit from religion and the gods of the forefathers and all that we narrated this idea of the state and that would be the king or [1801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1801.039s)

you know we the priest and eventually that becomes the state we have today and the state is so far behind and the problem is of course is the other one is that if you have if you create a monopoly will instantly go corrupt and become dysfunctional and we've created states so far that are not competing one another at all they're local monopolies and this is of course [1820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1820.64s)

the problem you got the market the market is incredibly efficient i can give an example of my team we just studied construction sites in east africa east africa is like wide open right now it wants to expand quickly it looks at china and india it doesn't care too much about regulations so this is the perfect place for a chinese construction company to beat the shed of [1839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1839.36s)

a french construction company with the bid for a construction nairobi because the french come there with a european attitude they learned you know the hard way that we need to make an assessment a risk assessment before we start building and by the time they start the risk assessment the china is already up and building the construction anyway because they don't care about the risk [1855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1855.919s)

assessment so we still have this sort of this blatant aggressive form of capitalism running around the world and then on the other hand we have exactly what you said was like we need to create a functioning container within which the market can operate with some certain rules and then people scream oh that's socialism and we need a bigger state and [1872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1872.88s)

we know states don't function any longer and the states are going incredibly corrupt slow and they no longer work this is again this is part of the imaginary order crisis so it's an imaginary order it's a crisis of religion and politics in a fundamental one now i like them to go back to what actually worked and i know you also you you tend to [1892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1892.72s)

quote the silk group try it you tend to quote daoism buddhism as a rasterism i do too i find very little souls in christianity in islam when it comes to try to understand we're at right now i prefer these religions they've been around for thousands of years and to be created along the trade routes so i go to the metaphor of the bazaar now how does a bazaar work well a bazaar [1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1913.679s)

has to be employed because it's going to be around for thousands of years it's probably in some kind of an oasis town a longer trade route you put an old smart wise woman at the door you know you put that at the door nobody gets in without her permission so you have a membrane and containers start with functioning membranes so there are rules how you [1935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1935.519s)

conduct the trade in the bazaar otherwise bazaar will not work it's not a free market it's not a free for all you can do whatever you like because the basar falls apart so if you think of the system we're looking at as a kind of a bazaar that we need to create for the digital age it starts to make sense then we can have different bazaars that are competing one another but we have to [1955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1955.44s)

have a central framework for all the bazaars of the world which is how we implotatively use the world in that sense so that we don't completely go into collapse so the problem is that we both on the global level have to have a network of bazaars and another local level there are the bazaars but what i'm then proposing is that the bazaar looks to its own self-interest long time [1975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1975.6s)

see it keeps itself alive as a container within which you can put the content and this is why the market will not work unless the market is regulated it has to start there so the markets themselves have to look at the wrong regulation otherwise we should just boycott the market not be part of it just say that i don't want to be in the bazaar at all unless it works [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=1997.12s)

unless unless it has a functioning membrane unless it takes responsibility for itself in relation to other braziers it's not a trading place for me to be involved with it has to be something like that because we have a major a [[metacrisis]] of politics right now uh we know the states that we construct and no longer work and the only alternative out that seems to work right now [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2016.159s)

interesting enough imitates egyptian dictatorship and it's called communist china they at least seem to have a sense of what we call a sense socracy where they're going how they will control everything to a central computer we also know that that won't work either so the question is how do we open a society that's free and open enough to stay [2033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2033.679s)

creative and to stay open to bad news which dictatorships never do which exactly why they go extinct eventually and this is of course the central question ideologically speaking and it's it's a question of imaginary narrative it's in the imaginary order that's the crisis there the reason that you're saying it's fundamentally imaginary and why the [2054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2054.159s)

bizarre worked in the market didn't is the bazaar had a long-term survival interest in the market doesn't and that the long-term interest is in the imaginary realm there was some narrative that everyone the bizarre was a part of that was self-transcending so they wouldn't  the future to benefit themselves for some reason and that that's what's [2072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2072.639s)

missing currently that's the mythos is what is it that has us not maximize short-term personal gain because there is some higher order transcendental narrative that we will have be a basis to find our behavior is that right yeah so if you're looking around the bazaar on a map this is what you'll find interesting every bazaar it had the hospice it had the restaurant [2093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2093.76s)

in the hotel it had the bath house in the cliff which is also a social place it had a gym there was always a gym around the basalt they called sarkani the persians invented the gym 3000 years ago where you go work out and make your body fit and then it has the bazaar and you need to probably go to the whorehouse which is another word for [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2112.56s)

nightclub to socialize with people and see strangers and make friends with strangers and there's no better place than a nightclub or even a whorehouse if we're honest about it to make friends with a stranger and be absolutely naked in front of somebody which you are at a whorehouse and therefore you can make it trade the next day so the matriarch sitting at the front of the bazaar will [2131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2131.04s)

make sure that she checks you've done all these things now here's the most important thing though it wasn't my team in london that they discovered that every buzzer after you leave the bazaar you leave the town and go to the next town to trade you have to go up to a kostag the kostag is the origin of the monastery you literally have after you've done your traded bazaar you need to go to spiritual center and fix your mind this is where you go into what the dao is called dao with zoroasta is called the asha of the world you go into a relationship where you actually you go back into the logos you go back into reality as much as you possibly can including yourself and you readjust [2169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2169.92s)

yourself your own thinking oh you did a bad deal in the bazaar get rid of it get over it move on come back with a constructive mindset and all these trade route religions are basically they boil down the ethics to in what way are you constructively participating in the world in what way are you constructively representing your tribe when you're out here traveling doing the trades in what [2193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2193.2s)

way are constructively supporting the community that just embraced you and welcomed this you could do your trade and what we are constructively moving on to the next community you're going to enter so you can go into that bazaar and make more trade so the question here is that why do we miss out on the cost talk we we we separated religion from the [2212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2212.32s)

wrestle side and made it a private thing something you do on sundays you go to church and show off yourself and of course that eventually ended up with us being cynical about religion like well i only go to church on sunday it's only worth investment if it looks good so i can make more money on the monday while exploiting the world so the the cost stock is fundamental to [2231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2231.68s)

interactions especially when it comes to larger populations than our own tribe as soon as we move into a larger public zone track we need to start containing ourselves in our behavior in relation to other people the cost talk eventually leads to the monastery traditions of all of eurasia especially buddhists and so asked in the dallas monasteries and i think it really pays off for most people [2252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2252.24s)

today to go and spend some time a year or two in the monastery and try to figure out what it means to meditate and contemplate every morning of your day to have a constructive mindset towards the world it has to it has to be his personal spiritual journey involved here and it was required at the bazaars it was required it was the first thing they would ask you the next time you come to [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2272.0s)

oh did you go to the cost talk after you did the training busar the last stop you made otherwise you're not welcome otherwise you haven't done your work this became such an industry he even had to build costumes in mountains you know got hello tibetan buddhism you had to build a mountain where the monks themselves and the non-stem cells prepare themselves for all the heavy [2294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2294.0s)

loads that they had to go through with the traders in the cost talks in the trading towns so it became like a spiritual industry but that's fine and we need one today as well so uh did the next bazaar require some kind of uh ticket or proof that you've been in the customer they took your word for it [2314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2314.96s)

no absolutely and again this is this is how you get your credibility you get your credibility because you've done the trade many times yeah we can trust this guy the way we do grading today this is a 5.0 okay and he also represents a community that is underrepresented inside the bazaar meaning it's going to sell us stuff we haven't seen it before oh that's quite [2334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2334.8s)

exotic and interesting let him go in he will do fine but if he doesn't do fine if he's out competed by others he needs to go to the cost talk more than ever the next day to not take that looser mentality with him into the next trade it's very interesting um i not heard that story told that way um so there's a way that i think about [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2357.52s)

that relative to the world today where it uh it seems like something has changed in scale in a way that crossed the threshold that changed in type where the same thing even in network wouldn't apply i'd like to ask this question and get your thought on it so you went to the market after talking about the state and then [2379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2379.359s)

you said okay in the market there was something like law the woman at the front um had some kind of wisdom to be able to assess who you are some record of if you went to the cost dog or not some you know some indicators about you and then obviously she's probably connected to a network of [2397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2397.44s)

people who are reporting on what people are doing inside and there's probably something like police and whatever right so uh if someone is stealing or doing false advertising or whatever it would be that would go against the written or unwritten law of the thing then they get kicked out or something [2413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2413.2s)

like that so there's something like rules and there's something like enforcement which is what defines the membrane and so acting on the inside requires participation of the rule set one of the things that makes that work without being tyrannical is the smallness of scale yes and so unlike a massive police state um if the police in that thing started to get corrupt enough of the people could overthrow the police and um there's no such thing as a person at a bazaar who can use personalized data micro targeted split tested advertising on me like they can just say i got the best and i'd say what about these guys over here their shoes are cheaper and i can go touch them by myself right so there's not a radical asymmetry between billion dollar corporations and the purchaser it's like a dude on one side of the table selling stuff and a dude on the other side [2468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2468.16s)

buying stuff there's not that much asymmetry between the police and the non-police and so the symmetry is part of what makes something like caveat m tour buyer beware be reasonable or what makes something like the second amendment hey if we need to throw over the police we can deal with it a reasonable idea when you start to get to much more [2484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2484.64s)

radical when you get to much more size if you want to have something like rule of law across that whole size a very big membrane then you get pretty radical asymmetries of power in a radical asymmetry of power you don't even have things like the ability to check the corruption on it or even consent as a valid idea because of things like undue influence what does consent mean if i [2506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2506.48s)

don't have capacity to consent because the other agent is so much smarter than i am that they can manipulate me to do  which is like cold dynamics but a cold dynamic is nothing compared to ai's on [[social media]] or whatever else doing stochastic terrorism and population-centric warfare so i don't even need a monopoly of violence anymore i just need a monopoly [2524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2524.0s)

of influence and the monopoly of influence can make people commit the violence i want or whatever it is so when you start dealing with those who control ais and those who don't you start to deal with that level of um asymmetry of information processing [2541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2541.599s)

capacity voluntarism doesn't mean anything anymore the ability to because you cannot voluntarily consent in or not consent when you can't check all the stuff what does it mean for the people to be able to check the state that there's no way to process all the information because the state's using ai to process all the right um and how [2559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2559.44s)

do the people deal with the if there is a policing force at all the levels of asymmetry of power so if you say okay the nation says we're just doing city states let's keep them smaller and let's always make sure that if anybody has an ai there's a competing ai so you at least have something of some metrical size that can compete with it well now [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2577.839s)

we get this issue that let's just even take [[nation state|nation states]] we could go to city states but let's take something less than [[global governance]] anything less than [[global governance]] you still get global [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] meaning a situation where if they're going to do the up thing then we have to race to do the up thing or they beat us right they're going to [2596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2596.16s)

develop nukes we have to develop nukes they're going to develop ai weapons we have to develop weapons they're going to overfish the ocean well how do we stop them from overfishing the ocean if they have nukes and then they really need the fish for their population growth so if we don't overfish the ocean the fish are still going to go go so we might as well race over fish the ocean so those [[race to the bottom]] [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] are because you don't have a monopoly of violence to be able to enact rule of law which is why you want a global government but you don't want a global government because a monopoly of violence with no checks and balances become totally corrupt catastrophes dystopias so you want a global government that is not corrupt well that [2631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2631.04s)

requires some magic right um or really good design and i think that's where you and i are going to get so what i see is that the principles that were operating at the bazaar were scale dependent and that as the scale gets larger you get fundamental breakdowns in some of those things when the scale gets large [2649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2649.44s)

enough for instance that supply and demand have a radical asymmetry because even though in aggregate the total amount of demand total now supply the same flow of dollars the supply is not coordinated the demand is not coordinated and the supply is coordinated right i don't have a labor union of all google users who work together and use ai to coordinate [2667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2667.119s)

how they want to use google but google's the centralized corporation that actually has long term planning and org charts and again chart whatever so it's really google half a trillion dollar organization or whatever using ai's against a single user or facebook or nike or whatever it is and they can employ radical behavior mod techniques so [2686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2686.24s)

there's no longer authentic demand driving supply there's supply manufacturing demand based on one marshmallow stuff rather than two marshmallow and then say oh but do people want it after driving addiction and so when you have those types of asymmetries it's asymmetric warfare you don't have like the same principles that apply when [2706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2706.48s)

they're symmetry like buyer beware like second amendment like they just don't hold in the same way so you need a fundamentally different way of thinking how do we deal when there are competing interests across types of asymmetries of power that are totally unprecedented absolutely i agree totally here and i think you're not working on the same [2726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2726.56s)

thing you're doing it on the technological level i'm doing it on the narrator logical level i'm writing it one time you can do the technical level without the narrative levels no exactly exactly that's the point yeah so the the um the neurotology i'm doing at the moment uh the reason why i got into this thing [2742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2742.56s)

with the bazaar is of course the the whole the entire history of eurasia is being rewritten at the moment by asian historians many of them asian americans like chinese american indian-american persian-american historians and i have discovered that the entire history of asia is just a european 19th century founders it's completely incorrect it's just read the wrong way so that's [2762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2762.56s)

exactly why we see these patterns and and the reason what we're doing is because asia's history is much older than europe's and that's the asset here we need we need deep history we need long history to to look at what systems work and what stories worked over long periods of time and which stories failed and here's the interesting thing it is that we're looking at units like [2783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2783.359s)

empire which is older by the way then nation and look at these systems so what is an empire what is a nation what could it possibly be in what would technology subscribe to an empire in what way can human beings subscribe to certain empire and it turns out the empire that were very loose uh they were full of dialectical conflicts and dichotomies everywhere they were allowed they were [2804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2804.88s)

certainly encouraged they didn't worry too much about a diversity of looks like we did today the word much more about diversity of talents and a diversity of opinions because it strengthens the systems long term so you want to have these sort of competitive environments you want to have them within certain containers that work and you discover when you do these [2821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2821.28s)

formats that you don't need the police unless the size is big that's exactly why scale here is incredibly important we take to the tribal size somewhere between 1200 and 1500 people quite naturally and anything is smaller than that we're perfectly comfortable with we don't need a police force to be loyal to and even live and die for a community of say 1500 people but once it gets bigger [2842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2842.4s)

than that that gets more problematic and that's why you need these sort of [[social system|social systems]] and eventually even states or at least city states nations whatever for those things to work and they are required the question is on what level can people uh you know align themselves on what level can they for example vote for a politician that they would know and they say hi to the street well it's [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2862.72s)

only to a certain level but that's absolutely minimal level you must work with because otherwise people don't trust people around them they don't trust the leaders their elders or whatever then you have to go all the way up to global that's the challenge here it's unavoidable there has to be some kind of at least loose global you know [2878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2878.4s)

collaboration here and some certain global rules we have to have a membrane for planet earth itself and at least after the atomic bomb in 1945 in the late 1950s we got the first pictures of planet earth from outer space we tend to forget how young these pictures are this i was like little more than 50 years ago we finally saw this beautiful green blue planet where we [2898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2898.559s)

live and we saw this huge cold dark space out there that we cannot relate to so at least we know we have the gaia we have we have that narrative it's there and it's unavoidable i would even say that i challenge my students these days and say that the one thing a.m will take care of probably is to conquer outer space and you will not be involved and maybe that's a good place to start [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2920.24s)

because the ubers we suffer from should have some kind of a price we need to pay so you remind the students that if we don't fix this planet which is the only place we know we can actually live in the universe then we're done so the planet has to be fixed it has to be fixed it's unavoidable as a question and this is the largest size i think we should allow ourselves to think to [2941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2941.52s)

forget about our space but think of the satellites at least a space surrounding the planet creating the internet and what we then come to is of course the complexity has increased to higher levels than ever which therefore expect people to go absolutely bananas over the next 50 years that's our book digital libido by the way it's a very dark book because [2960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2960.72s)

the first thing that will happen now so people will go absolutely bananas they will go for all kinds of conspiracy theories that will create the weirdest sex and cults have ever seen they will lose themselves completely in this environment it will not be safe to be outside anybody can kill you for whatever reasons you don't know you know if anybody can order your murder you [2977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2977.44s)

don't know who's gonna kill you uh she says abe was killed in japan because somebody started making homemade guns in japan so japan has the same gun control problem that was america for that very reason so it's becoming a very unsafe world very quickly now that's quite obvious so the question then is we then have to move quicker towards the global order it has to be [2997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=2997.119s)

very very loose it has to be very loose then the question the next question is what would it socracy be like we need algorithms algorithms have a bad reputation today because they're so bad today but they could be much much much better they could much better reflect the world how the world actually operates i i call it the free and open algorithm to give it a positive spin is to get rid of the sort of manipulated algorithms corrupted algorithms and conformist algorithms that we have today we need to get rid of the manipulation the conformation and the corruption of current algorithms we need proper algorithms because algorithms is the only help we have with increased [3034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3034.16s)

complexity try to understand the world better and leadership has to be based on proper algorithms that give you a fair view what the world looks like again back to the logos the conspiracy theorists they won't avoid the logos as much as they can so they jump between the pathos and the mythos which is incredibly dangerous to put a lot of people in that realm we [3050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3050.559s)

need to go back to the logos and the algorithms are there to help us do that can you um explain for me what you mean by the good algorithms that we need for leadership to work okay so if it's a new paradigm uh it will be kartik at first now allow for chaos say an anarchy to establish [3069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3069.119s)

itself first which is what the internet has been so far the old institutions that used to be powerful the old logos the old pathos and the old mythos and the institutions built on those old narratives will try to defend themselves all they can although they're done i call this the the versailles versus paris uh dichotomy this is like 1789 in paris so versailles today is politics politics tries to manipulate the algorithms in political directions so the others are not free and open they don't reflect you and don't reflect the kind of world you want to live in and need to live in then we got the corruption of money they used to put the ads on the side with the percent of the algorithms for you when [3110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3110.96s)

you did your search now the ads are at the very top of the answer increasing the infill trading the algorithm itself it becomes a corrupt algorithm because money is corrupting it and money should not be involved in creation of the algorithm at least for you personally we try to search the internet the third one is the conformation and that means the old established institutions hate the [3129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3129.92s)

fact the world is splitting up in so many different directions and it's becoming so chaotic so though this old institutions like academia like mass media you know television stations you know the oldest years they will always say that you must be more alike you must be more conformed and therefore conformity in itself as a value precisely we need more people to you [3148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3148.96s)

know to be more creative about solving these problems we try to conform everybody into the same pattern so these are the three-fourths of the old institutions the way versailles would attack the streets of paris in 1789 by telling the true seats of paris off not realizing the people in the streets of paris could read write and count which nobody in the nobility of verse i [3170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3170.0s)

could any longer therefore the streets of paris finally came to the conclusion let's go to recite chop their heads off because the old institutions are useless to us these days because we can create the new institutions that could work of course that led to a bloodbath would you want to avoid would have a slow gradual decrease of the old institutions and [3188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3188.48s)

want the new institutions to come into place and the new institutions that come into place must represent the logos the pathos and the mythos they must credibly do that the different expertises that's why you and i are very very careful to not ever speak like in a sort of general sense we speak as the specialist we are even if we're considered to be generalists so i'm a neurotologist i do storytelling uh john cenafist and i have worked with this for the past 25 years you know he was a former script writer i was a former music producer it makes sense that we become philosophers of narrative and neurotology and we now want to move the whole deconstruction revolution of the 20th century into a reconstruction revolution 21st century [3228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3228.64s)

which is fiendishly hard we call it narrative you call it culture in your work where is the digital culture digital is still a tale digital is hardly even happening yet we just know it's going to happen and dire is going to remember absolutely everything the way it's been programmed at least it's going to remember absolutely everything that happens so thankfully we have a [3248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3248.72s)

data revolution in parallel with increased complexity and that data revolution should be the free and open algorithms that can help us to guide ourselves so we get a fair view of how the world actually operates it's required i mean that's how we're going to solve [[climate change]] at the end of the day you're not guess working any longer you're actually providing proper [3268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3268.079s)

data no [[climate change]] is happening here is the data the satellites provide the data this is the actual temperature in 500 different places around the planet right now this temperature should be in july this temperature actually is in july so you know the data at the end of the day convinces people finally to give up the resistance and realize that [[climate change]] is really happening and now it has to be worked on and that sort of logical argument the logos once the logos comes into the picture it becomes a lot easier to convince more people this is actually happening you cannot escape this any longer this must be done before that we just did the guesswork we just did the storytelling we just had fairy tales suddenly it's real [3306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3306.16s)

and this when the real on the logos when the reel from the pathos to the logos comes into the picture with the undeniable facts are there we have more hope of getting things done than we did by before so i i generally agree that important deconstruction happened and an important reconstruction of a different type a different dimensionality is [3332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3332.24s)

needed when you identify rightly that all of the narratives had embedded power plays in them music and you kind of deconstruct that you look at all the motivated reasoning that was involved in a way you actually heighten [3351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3351.44s)

power to be the the only game there is because there is no uh unifying basis of uh ability to form shared basis for choice making and so the ability to have epistemologies of is science and epistemologies of all ethics that work together better that are never adequate but we're [3375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3375.2s)

continuously improving that identify their own [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] and where the [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] affect the nature of the motivated reasoning itself gives you something like whether you call it metamodern or whatever some capacity for um shared choice making that is not just uh the game of power [3396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3396.4s)

so i would very much like to go there i very much like to go into the relationship between what has to happen in culture or narrative or [[superstructure]] or like our shared values or shared [[meaning making]] to inform choice making how that relates to tech but i think because you said a lot in there i think the place i'd like to [3414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3414.72s)

start is when you said what happened between paris and versailles we want to do a slow version now so it's not so bloody and that the previous institutions are kind of holding on there's this story that like looks like the sovereign individual put forward that said uh changes in tech change [[social structure|social structures]] we know that changes in info tax specifically do right so marvin harris said the first argument mcluhan really went deep with the second argument and that you get a [[printing press]] and it um in sheetalism and ushers in democracy and ends catholicism and ushers and you know lutheranism and other things [3453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3453.599s)

because the nature of everybody can have a newspaper and everybody can have a textbook is really different so you it's a democratizing force it was tech affecting the [[social system]] so then the idea that the next we we got modern democracies based out of that um the idea that the next major change in the information technologies the [3472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3472.0s)

internet computation and then shared distributed computation and so now we can share value online by moving bits around in net space as opposed to just atoms running physical space and we can find networks of affinity that are stronger than just the networks of geography so the [[nation state]] that was a geographically based thing to move atoms [3492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3492.0s)

around will be progressively less useful than the net based movements around thing and so you'll get these new emergent systems that kind of debase the old ones i think this is a good and partial insight i think there's a heap wrong with it and i want to hear your thoughts on one part of it because one specific part [3511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3511.839s)

there's quite a lot the fact that we can move bits around and have that correspond to value doesn't mean we don't also still have to move atoms around or that the virtual world doesn't completely depend upon the physical world and if the virtual world depending upon the physical world is debasing the integrity of the foundational thing it depends [3529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3529.44s)

upon there's a problem in that thing um so there's a bunch of things i have there a problem with it but one in particular you talk about how to have it be less bloody in the old institutions there was bloody overthrow of feudalism right the american revolutionary war is one of many there was a thing where the cemetery of [3546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3546.4s)

power was such that the uprising army could deal with another army sometimes right within a standing army pitchforks could deal with swords sometimes i don't see how the focus of how the old [[nation state]] institutional thing falls works very well with those who hold the nukes [3568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3568.72s)

because there is no other force that overthrows that thing unless you talk about ai's that can capture it that's fine um outside of that we can see the ussr go through a complete econo socioeconomic collapse a collapse of the political economy and stay a world superpower and turn itself into something else because [3587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3587.92s)

we got nukes so back off like it's a so i'm curious how you think about that when you think about the transition of power and uh how hard it is to deal with that particular part of it well the old structure stays [3605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3605.2s)

it doesn't go away you know food was still incredibly important human capitalism arrived it's just food production wasn't the center of the economy any longer it became a marginal part of the economy and so the same thing here uh the nukes are a perfect case but so far at least they're not owned by corporate corporations corporations don't have the nukes yet [3624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3624.799s)

so they're stuck with like large [[nation state|nation states]] hopefully not too many of them too quickly because otherwise the bomb is more of an acute problem the climate all of a sudden so that's certainly an essential problem right there and and i would say the institutions are still there and what you want to do is you want to keep those institutions that says that okay a few [3644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3644.24s)

of those institutions still have the problem with the nuclear bomb so it's locked up for good and then we can see if we use nuclear energy something better uh in in again that means that let's not give google the bomb you know that's that's the problem there whether that could still happen or not we don't [3660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3660.96s)

know yet and there's this is where it comes into we know from hegel that triads are stable and we need to try it the problem with with digital the problem we call the netocracy the pro problem with this new sort of this sort of global power lead the rights on digital and happen to be the people with the right talents the right motivation [3682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3682.319s)

to be powerful and influential during digital is that it's an entire new paradigm altogether and obviously big tech is the first one of the three metocracies and it's the first one in the sense that the the the asset here is no longer land or capital the asset here is data and because collecting and processing data is so [3702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3702.0s)

fundamentally different from collecting and processing money it requires a whole new set of talents the money goes to those who have the data anyway meaning they can concentrate on the data and the data processing and that's exactly big tech has done and then taught the rest of the world this is what we do so that is just the first of three [3720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3720.079s)

necessary uh structures and it represents the real in the sense that the data is the real here but that requires also symbolic order an imaginary order to complement that and we don't have those yet um the chinese have probably called you the way they call me they're interested in guys like us at the moment but they have their very definite plan what they [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3740.4s)

want to do next which is to create what we call a sun-socracy and the chinese idea of this in soccer is that increased complexity but also the possibilities algorithms to control data flows and have an oversight over the increased complexity requires at least for china and china's history to have one guy at the top so they go they don't go for the persian [3763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3763.359s)

model which i strongly propose which actually the us constitution is built on which is that you install power sharing from day one into the system before the system kicks in like in any bazaar you you you make sure that the power split between three or which none can dominate the other two because if one dominates the other two will stand up against the third [3783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3783.92s)

therefore you have a split and this is the beauty of the used constitution and what has kept the united states together since the 1700s precisely the constitution the constitution itself is in imperial order of persian origin and here's the difference the reason why the persons didn't spend their entire fortune building pyramids and finally just killing their whole civilization [3804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3804.079s)

build the pyramids was the persians knew judging from egypt they didn't want that they didn't want the pyramidal structures they didn't want the entire culture being obsessed with feeding the dead which is what the egyptians did right they wanted to feed the living so in so rastical status or astronism one of the trade route religions by the way it's very close to buddhism and daoism [3823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3823.839s)

when he did that 1700 before christ he said let's not do animal or human sacrifice any longer it's just a waste of resources he was in the logos completely there are no gods who pay any attention to sacrificing humans or animals this is ridiculous let's get over it let's die when we die and let's transcend ourselves by having children who take [3846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3846.0s)

over the world from us when we die and therefore he enabled the very thought that there could be civilization this is the first time in human history somebody thinks what a civilization could possibly be we could improve on the world everything doesn't have to be an eternal return of the same as it is in paganism it is an eternal return of the same the [3864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3864.4s)

seasons come and go the world come and goes people live and die and they breathe and live and die but there can be an event that's why our book is called prostitute there could be an event and the event can change sister forever the event can be for good or bad depending on us humans it can be hiroshima it can also be fusion nuclear power that might save the [3884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3884.319s)

world with you know affordable and imploded energy forever you know it could be any of those things it depends on where we put our imagination we put our efforts and we work that's so rasters inside and therefore he constructs that an event is possible and the the fact that event is possible is what we take with us the problem with our culture was that we started [3904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3904.319s)

believing the events so strongly forgot about the process this is the central problem of western culture if eastern culture got too stuck in the process didn't think the event properly then the problem with western culture is that we inherited from the persians was the belief in the event that the person is always tied to the process we ignore the process all together and therefore we [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3924.079s)

created a religion that says if we exploit the world until extinction comes god will come and save us and give us a new jerusalem that's literally what christianity and islam have been preaching for thousands of years and that is of course not sustainable at all we're now discovering that we need both the process the eternal return of the same circular time [3941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3941.44s)

and we need the event which is linear time we need to think the world both ways and this is on a power sharing power sharing reinforces that it says that there must be split power from day one before you put the button on the ai it must understand the power mass display the chinese don't want that the chinese are terrified of it they go for the [3961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3961.92s)

egyptian model says no we're just going to have one fera at the very top and build a huge pyramid and off we go and then we know we're going to do with the data and increasingly now when data solutions become incredibly complex and incredibly expensive the chinese are going to excel at that because it's exactly what they're doing at the moment they're creating a modern-day egypt the [3979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=3979.92s)

question is then can we especially america then create an alternative which is more like the persian imperial model and i think building on the u.s constitution is the beginning because the logos the pathos and the mythos the three nurses are split the logos is the congress the pathos is the president and of course the matriarchal [4001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4001.68s)

at the opening of the bazaar is the supreme court at least it should be where the mythos is located so the the you you have a neurotology here that is balanced dialectical it never arrives in one truth because the three different truths that can be spoken at any given time depending on which of the three positions you take now we know that for a fact it's a [4022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4022.24s)

pragmatic solution to the overall problem of power and the narratives must be there from all three angles therefore we must have a system that implements all three so my suggestion that whatever you do with ai make sure it splits itself dialectically into these three posts before it does anything else whereas the chinese are going for no we got a one guy at the top we're going to [4042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4042.88s)

marry the a big cmp and off we go and we have the pharaoh okay if i might ask a question because i was uh listening to this fascinating conversation and one question arose and maybe daniel you can answer to this because we were talking about you know conscious design of technologies and you know outcomes [4067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4067.359s)

that we didn't expect kind of ways we were talking about you know a [[third attractor]] and an ecology you know of of new narratives but at the same time um we know that we are uh storytelling beings you know we can't really live without narratives and myths and stories except we go maybe in meditation and try to [4089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4089.92s)

get rid of that but then at the same time we also know that events are way more random than we think you know so we see that you know in the policies let's say how europe dealt with russia and nobody could foresee what is happening right now and so the the question really is like if you have uh our urge to live with narratives and the randomness [4114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4114.0s)

of future events so the it's it's kind of a creator paradox or creator parallax so how do we create a better future and more functional narratives if we know that the events are way more random than we think and that we can't really foresee what kind of effects our decisions might have and so that that question is kind of boggling me sure um music it's funny because um music a lot of people think about religion in terms of narrative and there's probably a distinction that alexander would make between narrative [4163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4163.759s)

and mythos but roughly i'll just say in terms of narrative and you're talking about the ability to forecast the future of a certain kind of certainty about the future um and i i think one of the things like religion says mixed bag because there was like good philosophy and then political [4184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4184.4s)

power plays that got mixed together because of course memes don't spread for no reason they spread because someone's invested in spreading them and they so you you get like good kind of gnostic in the scene and whatever thinking but then you get the counsel and i say i'm making the bible and the crusades and they change the stuff to be supportive so like the throw [4202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4202.0s)

the religions out completely or believe them completely are both silly right you've got to kind of look at which memes are true good and beautiful and which ones one wore and coordinated people well and the difference between those but if i think about the meaningful part of religion a big part of it is how do we actually deal [4220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4220.159s)

with the radical uncertainty of the world and knowing that all the choices we make are going to be consequential not making choices and still making a choice as consequential and i'm making every choice under partial information and there is some stuff that is quite possibly affecting the situation that exists in the unknown unknown side i don't even know that i'm not factoring it so how do i make progressively competent rational decisions while holding the profound amount of uncertainty that we have to have um so there's like a mature relationship to both certainty and uncertainty and being able to hold those together where you both get way more epistemic humility and way more epistemic rigor at the same time um okay so that was just one thing so i don't think you get anything like perfected [4278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4278.56s)

prediction and i don't think it's even a good impulse like i don't think it arises from a healthy place in people this is why so often when i start conversations with friends like one that happened earlier today about ethics i end up starting with heisenberg and gordal and tarski and like the upper limits of nobility [4297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4297.44s)

because what it means is i'm not going to get an ethical system that's computable um that as girdle said my mathematics can be consistent or complete but not both which means bound to incompleteness forever or what heisenberg showed about measurement which is deeper than science upon which science rests is [4314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4314.4s)

i get um i get indeterminism forever right like a fundamental thing so that doesn't just mean throw up your hands and believe in whatever god you want but it does mean that the impulse to certainty is an immature one and the the unknowable set is larger it's a larger infinity than the noble set is [4335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4335.04s)

and so like a healthy relationship with unknowability is part of spiritual maturity or cognitive maturity or emotional maturity or probably all of those um and so then how do we make choices in the presence of that um i don't want my narrative to tell me how it's all going to go with high certainty i want it to like help me orient to how to make good choices in the presence of the uncertainty as well i think you guys had a conversation with mark uh the rabbi on here not that long ago and he said something to me that i think [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4373.679s)

might have been the best formalization of ethics i have ever heard he said that all fairs of ethics are feathers of intimacy because if you're in real intimate contact with any reality whether it's a tree or a forest or a person the intimacy of the contact meaning you're not modeling them in some trolley problem where you're actually really in contact with their sentience informs you everything you need to to not harm it with both the motivation and the sentiment the sensocracy in an embodied sense of it um so the narrative that actually takes us into way more intimacy with the world um uh how we come to progressively better knowing but we never think that the knowing is more true than it is which becomes a false idol right um these are the things i want a narrative a good a good religion to do but just very pragmatically i think there's a lot of things we say we couldn't possibly predict that are [4429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4429.84s)

really predictable and we're we're not trying or we're lying music um or we're just applying silly models there's places where we're applying silly models like engineers not factoring psychosocial effects if they're not being trained in social sciences like [4445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4445.84s)

that's just silly like we should just do a better job of that but there are plenty of places where it's like oh we had no idea putin with such and such really like nato aggresses on his border in every  way possible and he's like dude  just don't just commit to not take ukraine in tornado and they're like [4462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4462.48s)

no we're not going to do it they're like how much did we like the cuban missile crisis the idea of russian bases that close it's like oh we have no idea who's gonna do that really like just what would you do in his position play the [[game theory]] a little bit so there's a bunch of places where the unpredictability is um for things that are actually decently [4480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4480.0s)

predictable um and then there are places where it's like okay there's a radically complex thing i don't know what's going to happen well that's where you have to do safe to fail probes is there some way to be able to run an experiment here that is not consequential depending upon how it goes [4497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4497.28s)

and if there is no safe to fail probe then just don't do the thing yet right um so with a lot of ai and biotech and i think those are the answers and then a lot of it just has to do with processes of recursion so let's say i want to forecast how my new technology is going to affect people [4517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4517.6s)

so i think about what are the things this is going to enable that will actually be really desirable as a result what behaviors are those people are going to do as a result how does that affect their minds and psyches does it there's some super simple principles like if it's engaging their attention it should make their attention span better if it has an effect [4534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4534.0s)

just there's some [[base reality]] that it's engaging with it should enhance the [[base reality]] it engages if it has choice architectures that are designed to affect the choices people make i affect their intention it should support their net intentionality and their sovereignty of locus of control like there are some things like that that should be ubiquitous and they're [4551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4551.44s)

just not um that could help to even have [[sensemaking]] frameworks to think through oh we couldn't have guessed it would have done did you even think about it what it would do to attention or intention or polarization or anything like that so we can just do a better job but there will be still be some stuff you don't predict right so then you run an experiment and then you say oh wow i did the show we didn't know so now you turn that into the design process then you do a beta release and then you're watching for a bunch of stuff including some that you don't know right you're watching for some stuff but you're also just saying let's just watch the people using the people [4582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4582.88s)

around them and just see if there's any weird new stuff that happens because that's how we deal with the unknown unknowns is that we don't formalize what metrics too closely we just watch for weird stuff right and we didn't expect that there'd be less time at the family dinner table that's worth noting so one of the things is if i don't even know what to look for [4600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4600.64s)

just do kind of broader spectrum observation and then say okay let's see if we can find out why do some research on it and then internalize that into the design and fix it again but that means that when you observe the thing and then you come up with a new design whoever comes up with the new design has to have the authority to implement it [4618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4618.719s)

not just oh sorry that goes against our business model and we have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit so you have to create a business that has a collect or a corporation or whatever it is that has a [[collective intelligence]] uh i mean excuse me that has a type of intelligence that is oriented to be able to forecast as much as it can and to [4638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4638.159s)

recursively upgrade itself where mistakes were made i think this ties nicely into our idea of the bazaar so there has to be some kind of new container here that works and it's alternative to the sort of the chinese fantasy of the cinesocracy that's more free and more open and therefore more sustainable more resilient and will last [4659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4659.679s)

longer the argument for the persian empire is not a moral one the argument is that the persian empire lasted for two thousand two hundred years the egyptian empire repeatedly imploded and with that knot and only lasted for six years was overdone with so stalinism doesn't last that's the argument against stylism here resilient systems actually are pragmatic [4678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4678.88s)

and they realize that splitting narratives and splitting power from the very beginning makes the system much more resilient over time and therefore it can work in the kind of environments moving into right now this is something you said about splitting power and you program that into the ai and this seems extraordinarily problematic because [4696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4696.96s)

um checks and balances on power yes we like that idea so one you know as well as i do that ai is not being set up that way and it's moving really fast so there's a reality to tend to here the other thing is that making uh similarly powered ai's divided in an [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4718.0s)

adversarial network is how you make both of them crazy smart right and so the reason that alphago was able to defeat stockfish like it was standing still was because you never programmed a single human game in it you made two computers play each other a trillion times in three hours and so what that then does is say okay well this system can check this system vice versa the two of those systems now in a or either of them in combined capacity is so asymmetric to every human system true but but but the the computers are still only doing the logos at least i want to believe that so the pathos of the methods are two realms left and if at least the computers are interesting [4760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4760.64s)

in interacting with human beings they don't go off into outer space and do their own thing as a technological intelligence which probably should lead them to do is basically say you can have mars on your own right please don't kill us on earth right or something like that but if you think about at least at least so far history has been about human beings and as many [4779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4779.84s)

human society we're talking about here and naturologically speaking the computer cannot do the mythos and the computer cannot do the pathos it can only do the logos but it does that logos with incredible efficiency and that's incredible you've seen have you seen dolly yeah yeah the visual gpt3 visual audio gpt3 yeah [4798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4798.159s)

um so it's early right but uh will it be able to generate mythos that are compelling for people at a turing test passing level totally will it be able to generate art that is evocative enough that people experience catharsis high pathos sure so is it experiencing pathos or methods no [4819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4819.12s)

but can it do a thing that evokes it in fact maybe even split test for its ability to do that progressively better on an asymptote sure now this is really  up and interesting right because and considering how terrible the latest star wars script is if that was written by humans then humans don't deserve to survive to be honest about it you know we need better artists than that he's [4840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4840.719s)

just so crap so yeah um i i think i think when we're moving to the other we're moving into the third detox here the second one is the sense of cracks or whatever is collaborating with the satellites and the data flows around the world to create the container so if you isolate the container and [4860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4860.239s)

think of the container what we usually call politics is separate from say commercial business and and enterprise which is what we call the so that that those two are separated we have the informational lists or the informationism which is which is essentially data and and that's big tech today the second one is socrates whatever replaces politics we know it [4879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4879.52s)

has to be some socratic and if we don't save the planet to begin with since occurs it will never even happen so the socrates has a self-interest in at least saving the planet to begin with the chinese are the model we need to catch up with them quickly and create a different model that i call more person the third one though is the third metrocracy is the artistic one this is [4896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4896.56s)

the imaginary one you know the the the the real one it's tied to the papa so this is the artistic one because art like sex and violence are actually tied to pathos so this is intensely human this is the intense this is where sexuality violence is located this is where as far away from the machines themselves as possible and this is where the symbiotic intelligence comes in for [4918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4918.8s)

example if you're going to write a really fantastic eight hour series that gonna spell by spellbound in the world what you would do today is that you will collaborate with the ai you will do symbiotic intelligence and practices as an artist and i think at the end of the day the machine on its own doing it will be vastly inferior to what a human being can do with the machine i think for the [4937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4937.76s)

foreseeable future we're saved by the fact that symbiotic intelligence will be better than [[artificial intelligence]] in all of these three narratives that i'm talking about and if that is the case which otherwise might we you must be around you know but if that is the case then the the artistic aspect is the really protopin one so the protopian it's not so much that in art it's not so [4959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4959.04s)

much that you productively incrementally improve on something one step at a time like you do for an engineer the protopianism for an artist is just the the unbound exploration of the darkest shadows and the most fascinating storytelling we could possibly have and you're telling it to grown-ups you're not telling it to children in a fundamental sense like real art is [4980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=4980.639s)

challenging you it's challenging you in a transformative way and it has to be the third aspect of an autocracy and we will give away the third power to the people who with their machines are capable of doing that this is where art is heading and i think again our term that you and i develop symbiotic intelligence fits better here than [[artificial intelligence]] when it comes to doing these things i've wrote pop songs for 25 years and i've heard machines writing pop songs and yes they sound generic and professional but they sound like german pop songs like they say like i just copy last week's number one record and make it a new record now we can hear what you copied it's just too similar to what we heard it's eerily boring right and so [5018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5018.239s)

far at least the machines have not been able to come up with anything else because machines always work in the past the the curse of logos is that logos can only work with data that already exists it can only write things that are similar to already have but the idea to imagine a future that's radically different from anything we've ever seen is still a very [5037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5037.04s)

very human capacity funny because one of the reasons that gpt3 is passing the turing test now is because for many audiences and if you have gpt3 created text in areas of subject matter expertise and subject matter experts are looking at it they know it doesn't pass the train test but for general chatbot functions it does [5059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5059.92s)

but it's not because the ai has gotten that good it's because most people's ability to be able to vet theory of mind or have deep conversation has gotten so bad that there's like this like it's kind of funny if it's like reclaim the quality of the turing tests by increasing human intelligence to be deserving of the term of general intelligence that we can make the test a [5079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5079.679s)

little harder um the reason i bring it up is because so let's say we have a symbiotic intelligence where we have a human using a transformer ai to generate stuff and people like it well in the classic adversarial network type style i could then train another ai on the output of that symbiotic intelligence and whatever [5099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5099.679s)

the metric of win is um pop chart hits or whatever that is going to be judged by the demand consumption of by other humans i just say beat it and of course now what it's trained to do is be able to identify the things that do more of that and so of course it will like it'll it'll be able to beat that if we can define in any narrow metrics because it's the same as beating us at starcraft [5120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5120.96s)

or chess or go as soon as it can define it as a finite game i don't think it can win the an infinite game but i also don't think most humans are oriented to infinite games right now nor our [[economic system|economic systems]] or anything else and so it's like i think the symbiotic intelligence would produce more meaningful things if the depth of what it means to be [5141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5141.28s)

human in the depth of the experience the depth of the pathos and the mythos that are not the logos is fully brought to both the creation of it and fully brought to the appreciation of it by others which is now why this work in in culture and narrative is so important because anything less than that if it's if it's consumers who want [5158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5158.0s)

one marshmallow [[hypernormal stimuli]] and producers who want to supply that now the ai will be the symbiotic intelligence yeah and this is this goes for popular culture certainly and we're very dark in digital libido said it is not right that the vast majority of people will be sedated by popular cultures probably manufactured machines because it's more [5176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5176.48s)

efficient to do it that way but there'll be something eerie about it the thing is that you might be fooled once but you're not fooled several times over until you discover this eerie feeling that this is increasingly predictable and it's increasingly flattering like the culture's fighting and this is the problem of popular culture it might work for kids stories it might work for [5196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5196.56s)

disney right but that's not art at all and i think this is why we so strongly philosophically defend the concept of art and we put put it in the pathical narrative the mythical narrative yes can be mass-produced it can be manufactured by technological intelligence it's just if you put the button on the and it produces disney culture that's exactly the new star wars series that's why it's [5216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5216.88s)

crap because the script is so bad it's so predictably bad right because it just tries to flatter you try stuff like transcen it doesn't challenge you it's not going to transform you at all real art therefore has to be located next to sex and violence and we call the tantric realm in the really grown up adult realm it challenges you fiercely otherwise it isn't hard at all and it challenges you [5238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5238.08s)

to transform you the truly artistic experience is not just to kill time that's what silicon valley and hollywood are trying to do they just try to kill time no real art is that you go through transformative experience like a spiritual experience that transforms you you're totally different person when you come out of experience compared to who you were before in either direction it [5257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5257.28s)

doesn't matter you've changed you have gone through an event your life is no longer the repetition of the same i don't see any machine being able to do anything remotely like that yet and that's why art has to get out of popular culture return to his own realm and go spiritual and that's why we put art in the pathological narrative that's what's important in their ecology [5278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5278.88s)

mythical narrative can be mass-produced yes that's popular culture but pathetical narrative is an entirely different thing and i would know because i was in the mythical narrative production when i was a pop song writer and pop song producer i never tried to do jazz or opera i went to the opera and i enjoyed jazz because i didn't do it i didn't do [5297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5297.12s)

anything pathetic a little i did mythical things but to then go into the pathical narrator where i tried to be as a philosopher is fiendishly more challenging but it's absolutely required and this is probably of all the three narratives the hardest one to nail because at the end of the day we now live in the world where death is the absolute i i'm adamant i'm with a lot of thinkers today to say that the problem with the west is that we banned everything that was uh out of our comfort zone and we basically called it sin and at least in the east they realized that no sin is not going to disappear so instead of creating pressure cookers that blow over all the time and cause huge warfare and misery instead it's [5335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5335.52s)

better to have it around but to have it around inside a container and only those who can handle it can go there and handle that container they're the ones who can have access to it that's the concept of tantra this is the division sutra is the message the narrative that makes people love their children so they want to survive that is the ultimate truth of sutra sutra has a direction it must be exactly that the opposite of the sutras the chant is like okay we don't know where this is going therefore we're containing it we're keeping it in some kind of a laboratory and it can only be accessed by people who can really go through it and that's where sex and art and violence must be located that we must [5373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5373.12s)

realize that these are factors of human life and that's what we're working with as philosophers at the moment so i think it's important here to make that distinction i don't see any machine even being remotely close to creating a credible ethical narrative in the foreseeable future it's funny that you say that uh the elites now believe in death because [5392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5392.4s)

um in so many important ways i don't see that like the uh extreme life extension movement radical life extension movement for radical biological extension is totally a holy grail pursuit and then the biggest one of course and the brain computer interface [5412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5412.639s)

um pursued all the way up to the full digital consciousness singulatarian we can all be uh ai gods in a universe that we can fork infinitely remember how i told you daniel that engineers don't know what they're doing because the engineers haven't talked to the priests this is the perfect example to give [5430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5430.88s)

exactly that they're going to create things that are not at all what they thought they're going to create so whatever they're all going to be disappointed when they're dying finally learn to die with some grace and i think but i think the deficit absolute has arrived it has existed all along buddhists thoracis and taoist always [5447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5447.52s)

knew they would die when they die and the question is what transcends you they always have that question that questions been around for thousands of years we just need to get rid of these childish religious that promise us the afterlife of the reincarnation because it was too hard to tell children that their parents had died right it's just it's just better steps would have a right i think [5465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5465.6s)

it's a dominant story today and i think these people who try to escape but try to escape precisely because they find it hard to die it's funny one of the things i really like about the invisible afterlife um i like the reincarnation version better than the l version but i like that you can get narcissistic and even [5484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5484.239s)

sadistic people to do the right things for the wrong reasons um meaning if i don't want to reincarnate badly and i can't hide the karma from god or from a universal accounting system then even though if i could hide it from the humans i'd everybody over and get ahead and if death was the end that'd be fine the fact that i can't [5506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5506.08s)

hide it from the day of judgment or whatever it is means now i have to do the right thing for my own prevention of suffering i think that was actually brilliant and i think there were places where that obviously it didn't work all that well in any place but a place where it did um how you create a system [5523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5523.36s)

where even if someone uh if someone's focus of self is too personal right too much narcissistic trait not enough um empathy et cetera they still are oriented to a system of ethics i think that's one of the things the system has to do as a fail-safe while it works to condition people who all have authentic [5547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5547.52s)

intimacy where margin ethics can arise um i know it is time for us to wrap up and it's late one thing i was going to say we should do next time that would be fun we opened a lot more threads than we closed but that's good you start talking about um what ai won't get and will get in the future and what the [5569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5569.28s)

three different types of nitocracies will be in i i think if we were to just kind of give a vision like what is a positive vision for the not too distant future like you know 50 years out or so that we can see that involves uh getting mythos pathos [5586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5586.56s)

logos all meaningfully better right that my terms might be getting some of the critical things that have to happen in infrastructure and [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]] whatever um what is a vision that could happen that would be a fun that'd be a fun place to go i totally agree uh so i just want to add that we also need a new sutra [5606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5606.88s)

a new story about how we're going to love our children therefore we want our children to survive us we need a new one so we can't go back to the old ones and and when it comes to the belief in the afterlife that also ruined ancient egypt that's why ever since then we sort of suspected that we will not live after we're dead so the afterlife was a very very [5626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5626.719s)

destructive thought in that sense when it was taken all the way through the ancient egyptians at least in the first kingdom seriously believed that life after death was more important than life right here and now ever since then but at least we doubted it so uh i think those those i think once the gene is out of the bottle historically in the sense that a certain tantra is now leaked into [5645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5645.6s)

the sutra and we can no longer pretend it's not there that's what i mean we cannot construct the system we believe in the afterlife we believe in reincarnation longer we cannot even believe that we're going to conquer outer space and live on other planets because way too late to that race ai will certainly beat us to it so a i will take bacteria away and go to other [5662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5662.56s)

planets and we won't even be part of the game that's more likely so we can look into that we can look into what could possibly be the new sutra be what could be the new story we could actually tell each other and agree on and then at least the tantra itself we know it's around but it's hidden in containers for the people who can actually absorb it and understand it and thankfully because [5680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5680.48s)

it's tantra is so tied to complexity that we can only specialize on certain complexities like you and i honorably do he says yeah we're supposed to be generalists when nobody can be a generalist any longer that's impossible we can only understand that that's impossible therefore we're more hegelian in the sense that our absolute knowing is not that we know [5698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5698.96s)

everything it's that we know the limits of our own knowledge and we thrive within that limit and that's exactly what we're promoting very pragmatic ideas constantly we will learn from history like and it's moving quicker than ever it's more important than ever to be pragmatic about history and to make due process before we make decisions and start building things [5717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5717.92s)

that's where you're absolutely adamant anything else is completely irresponsible from now and historically speaking so i would love to do a game more yes absolutely all right this is fun alexander daniel thank you so much for taking the time i think it's very late [5733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5733.84s)

at your end daniel what is it two o'clock in the morning already yes thank you again uh uh fascinating conversation i would love to do a second part where we uh have a look at the future in 50 years it sounds super interesting um yeah thank you guys thank you tom for making the space and [5752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5752.159s)

having us here and uh and alex for uh having the dialogue i it's funny because you and i think about things that are so related and i think both try to bring deep frameworks and they're such different frameworks there's like such different schools of study that um [5770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5770.719s)

uh i really enjoy it because i get different insights and learn every time we talk thank you so much i'm on i'm over here in europe and we have hegel nietzsche you have the fantastic american pragmatists and our shared friends layman pascal and sachstein are big fans of purse and james and these guys that is the other tradition that i really really really think is fantastic [5790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5790.08s)

and for anybody's interest in philosophy you need to do your hegel you need to and certainly you're freud but you certainly need to do the american pragmatist that's the tradition you come from and i hear it in the way you speak and the way you address issues that so much of american pragmatism coming through to you and i should say this last thing i'm off to the borderland [5808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5808.32s)

next week which is northern europe's burning man so of course another thing that donald and i have been calling is both good old burners well have a blast there i have some friends that are going to be going there and maybe i'll connect you and you can meet up there exactly speaking speaking of the pathical narrative participatory culture [5826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk2HinTpRwQ&t=5826.8s)

is where it's at
