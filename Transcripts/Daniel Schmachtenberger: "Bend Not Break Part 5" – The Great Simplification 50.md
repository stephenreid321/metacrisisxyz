we have arrived at episode 5 in the series with my friend and colleague daniel schmachtenberger called bend not break in this final episode of this series we do an overview of short-term intermediate term long term and culture political economy infrastructure a three by three grid on how do we think about responding to the upcoming [[metacrisis]] to the upcoming great simplification at the end daniel and i invite viewers to put questions in the comments section on youtube for what we might do a follow-up episode on uh this was quite a journey we wended our way through the fifth episode and uh i hope you enjoy it without any further ado here is daniel thank you greetings my friend [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=64.44s)

good to see you my friend happy to be back you too you look especially wise today yeah that happened when i don't trim the beard for a while it's a nice effect you had some wisdom uh 30 years ago or whatever that was you chose to move from iowa to san diego it's going to be zero fahrenheit here tomorrow night is freaking ridiculous man i don't know why [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=89.22s)

i've chosen to live here because you can't exercise you're like yeah i'm gonna go for a snowshoe and you go outside and no i'm gonna go watch a podcast um so i'm it's very cool i might say this is the grass is always greener thing but i miss it i uh i actually love snow i love uh particularly my [110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=110.159s)

um body is happiest in the mountains in the snow and um the feeling of the cold air and the lungs and everything yeah i love it so i hope you enjoy it some in between the yeah i do enjoy it some but my body is happiest in like 60 degree misty old growth redwoods um year round i i i would take it all right you're obviously there investing in a long-term [[climate change]] resilience strategy oh yeah well that would be a full episode on itself um the the medium term models show this minnesota wisconsin area that i'm i live in not too bad but you know that that's a huge huge topic um so my friend we have arrived at [158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=158.64s)

um what i expect will be the conclusion of our series that we initially titled bend versus break based on the logic that we have unpacked these last four episodes between humans how we use energy materials and monetary markers to create technology and there is an embedded [[exponential growth]] in our current system combining these things that is heading us towards an inflection point the inflection point is if we are able to continue to grow that has a bigger environmental impacts more material energy use co2 and other things if we're not able to continue to grow there is a wiley coyote biophysical moment that we have to prepare for and your work with consilience project [218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=218.879s)

and my work with the great simplification and the institute for the study of energy in our future are to uh change the initial conditions of these future moments uh and kind of meet the future halfway so that we bend the civilization trajectory instead of break and break would be bad um so i think we've uh you know done a horizontal and vertical treatment of the [247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=247.86s)

risks and the um the drivers and the [[generator function|generator functions]] of humans for thousands of years arriving at this point at the end of the last episode uh you preferred a three by three grid on how uh we could think about responses interventions mitigations what to do and it was [[superstructure]] [[social structure]] infrastructure and triage transition and long term and [281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=281.0s)

this podcast we're gonna we're gonna unpack that first of all if i say [[superstructure]] [[social structure]] infrastructure we're going to have the word structure in like 270 sentences is there shorthand for those three that we could use yeah so those terms uh come originally as far as i know from marvin harris's work in uh the what's called cultural [308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=308.88s)

materialism and but that draws from previous work of uh marx and other people [[superstructure]] basically means culture means the uh ordinating values the identity the um aesthetics ethics axiology that a civilization is oriented towards so we'll just say culture it's simplifying but we gotta just [[social structure]] basically means the codified processes [335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=335.94s)

by which agreement across the population occurs so this is both this is a political economy basically gov the intersection of economics governance and the institutions that mediated judicial system law the scientific institutions that are needed et cetera so we'll just call that political economy and then infrastructure means the totality of the physical technical stack [359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=359.28s)

that the civilization uses to support itself and meet all of its physical needs that's uh energy transportation manufacturing materials waste management blah blah all those things food water so we'll call that tech um so by tech here we don't mean software [[social media]] we mean the totality of the human technology and sometimes we use the term infrastructure [384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=384.72s)

because it's common but if we just say technology political economy and culture that roughly maps to this thing now we already did this thing in episode two or four or whatever it was so people can have that reference and yeah i'm very happy to have arrived at the uh point in the podcast that many people have been looking for where they're asking so what are solutions uh and we will get to [409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=409.56s)

share some things that are hopefully inspiring while simultaneously probably disappointing people that we're not going to offer something that looks like one easily tractable simple thing that they can go do something about that solves everything um but something i wanted to say is just in recap this episode will really be much more [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=427.74s)

useful if people have watched the previous four um if you've got the time to watch this one and you haven't watched the previous ones i would encourage that number one we largely unpack uh a core of nate's work regarding the relationship between energy the environment the [[materials economy]] and finance and uh really a fundamentally critical thing to understand what break will mean and what bin requires bend not break is of a safe term you have used uh for a long time and then we're kind of going back and forth on models here number two and number four are unpacking additional frames for what we call the [[metacrisis]] and we had a little break with number three where unintentionally [469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=469.44s)

we ended up talking about psychologically how do we hold being aware of the intersection of all the possible [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] and having any sense of human agency and uh so there's like a psychological interlude number three and so given that we have framed the problem set in a particular way we'll be talking about solutions in light of that [490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=490.5s)

where someone doesn't have that framing some of what we're talking about will seem like it doesn't make that much sense i'm just offering that as preface for everybody excellent uh and those will make available and i'd like to have lizzy uh the podcast curator maybe do a summary of of all five of these in one place so at the risk of delaying the punch [513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=513.719s)

line even further i do have a couple other things to add um when we talk about this three by three grid uh culture political economy tech stack and then short-term intermediate term long term it also is relevant uh to other frames number one what do people care about there may be people listening who just want to protect themselves and their family to [542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=542.459s)

what's coming there may be other people that deeply care about dolphins and citations and other species there may be people listening that work for governments or institutions um and i think what someone cares about is relevant to what we should do number one number two is there's the the scale of world government national government [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=570.959s)

local regional community neighborhood individual family and i think the what to do in your three by three grid will be different for those different scales so i don't know how we want to treat that in this conversation yeah i mean all there's a lot of things that need done right there's a lot of things that are not in eminent [594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=594.18s)

[[catastrophic risk]] but that are maintaining the not the quality of life for existing life and also maintaining things that would become a [[catastrophic risk]] to at least that local area if they weren't attended we want the nurses and the people that work at the animal shelter and the police officers and the firefighters and the educators to [615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=615.06s)

actually become increasingly passionate about what they do even though what they're doing isn't at the scale of how does it solve all of [[climate change]] or ai risk or nuclear risk um the idea that people would in the face of those things become less passionate about the thing they're doing would just start the cascade of everything getting worse faster and so [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=634.92s)

if what you have in the scope of agency that you can do something about is not the totality of the [[metacrisis]] but it is something real your connection to something real and paying attention to and focusing on the part you can do something about recognizing that the [[metacrisis]] is caused by the activity of all all people cumulatively it also has to be addressed by the activity of lots [659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=659.16s)

of people um yeah that's very important i want to make sure that we say and we mentioned this in number three that we want these conversations to help contextualize where you are in the world help you think about how to do a more effective job even at a local scale or even in a narrow vertical um but ultimately to enhance your sense [678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=678.839s)

of the meaningfulness of everybody's actions rather than otherwise the brief aside from what you just said you mentioned people working at animal shelters every week my girlfriend and i buy five powerball tickets and we've agreed if we win we're giving all the 10 percent of the money to animal shelters to protect dogs especially that are also going to go through the [705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=705.079s)

great simplification um you know there's 100 million dogs uh etc um in this country so uh that's something i think about a lot uh but that's just a tiny tiny thing out of everything that we're going to discuss so so let's get into it so we we know the problem set roughly uh and the problem set is huge and goes beyond what [729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=729.3s)

we've discussed we didn't talk much about climate or insect loss or some of these things we know the problem set we've got the framing the short-term long-term uh intermediate term and the different uh um lenses so before we get into that how does one even begin to think about what to do like what would be the intellectual uh structure for how to [753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=753.48s)

think about this and what not to think about maybe um there's a few things i want to share that might seem like non-sequiturs but i think they're valuable frames one is uh i remember a long time ago reading books on leadership and psychology and business and [776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=776.399s)

um then looking at the psychology of typology whether you're looking at myers-briggs or other systems of typology and it was clear how someone had succeeded in a particular business with a particular typology and then said these are the principles of success that would totally not apply to someone of a different type in maybe a different sector like warren buffett would not do [796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=796.079s)

a good job at steve jobs's job or vice versa and so if steve read warren buffett or rockefeller's principles on how to be effective they just you'd just be like i have to give up like i have no chance i'm not an accountant mindset i'm and so what i'm gonna share uh the immediate application of that is we have tens of thousands of people listening to this that are going to have [818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=818.82s)

wildly different temperaments and [[value system|value systems]] and and skill sets everything else so pay attention to of all the things you hear anywhere the ones that feel like they make sense to you and actually empower you pay more attention to those because um you know i might share principles that have been useful to me that might [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=836.82s)

not be that useful to you you have different dharma different passions different typology a different mind things that nate finds useful so take these as hopeful offerings but ultimately if they don't feel empowering then leave them and find other things um hopefully though we can share some things that can be adapted to any [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=856.26s)

typology that are general principles that's one thing i wanted to say preface the next thing i want to say actually goes back to animal shelters um i i grew up spending a lot of time working and volunteering in animal shelters and then animal rescues where there was animals that come from circuses or you know [877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=877.44s)

various places and in homeless shelters and just you know the i had parents that were into activism and and taking us to be socially engaged in um and so i grew up like just not being able to walk by a dog that was in bad shape or a cat that was in bad shape or a person in the sidewalk it was in bad [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=901.44s)

shape and like feel like it was okay to walk by and it was actually that work that got me into the macro systemic work because working in the shelter and seeing how many of the dogs were being put down while people are still buying new bread puppies and like then feeling the great success of working my ass off to get a couple dogs adopted but [920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=920.04s)

then seeing the scale of it right and then seeing that's just dogs right that's not cows and [[factory farm|factory farms]] i started thinking at scale but motivated by the high touch this dog right this cow there's a lot of people who think about [[existential risk]] like the ea community or rationalist community they think about [[existential risk]] in a very abstract way not having actually touched this is an [[existential risk]] to this person living in this refugee camp or in this ghetto or this dog or this whatever and it's abstract it can be almost an intellectual curiosity rather than an expression of actually embodied care and it can even be worse than that it can be like a topic that seems like it has power associated and so if someone can walk by the people on the street and not notice that much and if they aren't actively bothered by the situation animals are in i don't trust those people to be thinking about [[catastrophic risk]] um i only want like i only really want to trust people thinking about meta systemic stuff who actually ground it because otherwise you can you can say well long-termism in the future this many trillions of people might die if we don't such and such therefore we should do these things now and these things now might cause lots of harm but it's a good [1001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1001.579s)

expected value calculus utilitarian calculus long term and it's like or you know we have to do this war but here's the benefit and we'll try to minimize collateral damage it's like minimize collateral damage means how many moms are watching broken babies and that are civilians and bomb buildings it's like don't call it collateral damage don't sanitize it like so [1020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1020.38s)

but the people who are high touch and who can't walk by a person what does high touch mean i haven't heard that word before rather than high abstraction or thinking about the high-tech that a high orientation to the actual touch right like working with this animal like you know how much time you'll spend rehabilitating one dog [1043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1043.22s)

or one animal that's covered in oil one seagull and you're like  __  this is a lot of time right but it's totally worth it when you're with that one and then you think about scale and if you don't move to scale obviously you can't address the issues at scale for most people that's fine like doing the high touch thing is fine if you feel [1064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1064.52s)

like you can think systemically you can't lose the high touchness otherwise um the abstraction can make you disconnected enough to do evil in the name of moral things and that's a challenge but here's the other challenge that this uh harkens back to [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1087.98s)

our video number three is the more high touch you are given world events the more likely you're going to be overwhelmed in in what's going on and not be able to do things at scale because it's too overwhelming so you can be high abstraction and try to do things at scale but then you're not connected in the way that you're just describing [1113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1113.179s)

yeah so if you really if your heart is open and you feel and you see what i'm in new york city right now it's not where i live and it's cold this time of year and it's a  __  terrible place to be homeless and cold and if you let yourself feel that now it's just in istanbul and there were four million syrian refugees there and [1135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1135.08s)

there were you know they didn't speak the language and we don't speak the language necessarily of other places we might have to flee i saw a kid who i was talking to whose parents were both killed in the war he wasn't asking for anything he was just hiding because he said if he gets anything everybody well is violent towards him to take his stuff [1152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1152.48s)

and it was like if you let yourself feel that it's easy to just feel completely broken right and um and and or get completely pulled into i just need to be at this refugee camp working here and not think about can i do something at scale this spiritual psychological work to feel the depth of those feelings and [1178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1178.28s)

transmute it into more devotion and more agency and more strength to be able to serve and keep that high touch and figure out how to do strategy effectively is the only way forward i know that well it's liable i hope you don't mind me sharing this publicly but in our private conversations i have not criticized you but observed that that's [1203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1203.539s)

one of the reasons you are not being more effective globally is because you can't say no to helping people i know so many examples where someone is struggling with something and you're giving them time and advice and there's just only a certain number of hours in the day so you're high touch uh is you know a little bit of a lodestone to really being effective but let's let's [1228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1228.5s)

just go forward with that i think i understand your point the thing there is i struggle with it and there's so many places where i don't say yes to helping someone that i really wish i could because it would be saying no to work on projects that i really hope can change things at scale and believe can for a lot of people [1251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1251.6s)

but it's never easy for me to say no where i really could make a difference and i don't want it to be easy for anybody like i struggle with it and i might make wrong choices but i would like anyone to struggle with it right as opposed to just turn something off where then it's easy i would not like people there's the dialectic of things to wrestle with i [1271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1271.94s)

want someone to always be in the wrestling with and it's interesting because someone can say like hey this thing is not as important because of scale but the person who can harden themselves to the people around them will think wrongly and then do it wrongly about how to make a good world at scale i trust them less i trust more the [1292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1292.52s)

person who feels the people around them enough that they have to do something they feel compelled to and so this is where utilitarian ethics are not sufficient virtue ethics also are it's like the utilitarian ethic says uh you know what is the expected value for the world of me doing this thing versus doing that thing but of course i can't forecast all the  __  things [1316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1316.22s)

and i can't forecast weather 10 days out we're dealing with [[complex system|complex systems]] i might be totally wrong the virtue ethics says if you do the thing that has the most integrity in the moment the next moment will unfold from a moment that had the most integrity in it also has limitations you have to hold you have to hold them both together we probably should be scaling the number [1335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1335.2s)

of people that think that way rather than scaling the project that you or someone else is working on this is why we're talking about this first on the show is and that's why i was happy that you brought up the animal shelter topic is because how do you think about solutions well you don't only think about it you feel about it right you have to [1356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1356.0s)

like when we talk about the [[metacrisis]] we're saying you can't think about [[climate change]] and the economy and u.s china power dynamics separately they interact each other um obviously we see a war happen in eastern europe and we're going backwards on [[climate change]] in terms of fossil fuels and so you have to think about all the world together but the other corner [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1377.48s)

that is you have to use all the parts of yourself right you have to use your intuition and your intellect you have to use your passion and your kind of calm dispassionateness um so how do i cultivate the all of the capacities of self in service of all of the world is how i relate to that head heart and spirit i think you said on a prior [1400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1400.46s)

episode okay how else should we be thinking about this pre-pre-3x3 grid do you have any other yeah i think the 3x3 is very tangible and we will end with it a couple things i'd like to say are how not to think about solutions um i think this can be very helpful to start um first i want to give an example that was actually really cool for me lately um i just met some guys who are running an elite counter-terrorism unit and uh they had been special forces moved to domestic counterterrorism and a number of people's work dave snowden's [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1443.9s)

work my work other people they had been looking at and seeing how that could apply in these domains and have come up with some very innovative strategies to be able to protect life more effectively well with less resources while also being less willing to cause harm to the other side in the process like they they really just increased their effectiveness this is obviously a [1466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1466.46s)

very empirical very tangible maximally high consequence type real situation and the thing that they said and why we were talking the thing they said that they had to train the guys out of the most who were already special forces counterterrorism you know moved to counterterrorism guys was they had to move them out of [1487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1487.88s)

uh thinking about solutions too quickly and into being able to assess the uniqueness of this problem that is different than any problem they've ever been in before because they too quickly want to see which of the eight forms of drills they've done in the past this is and yet as you're getting more innovative terrorism it might not be any of the drills it doesn't fit and so [1509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1509.059s)

rather than look for which solution that i already know do i get a fit on this what they were training the guys to do is to be able to not think that their existing solution might be adequate so they could truly innovate to start by saying how do i assess the novelty of what's going on without letting my existing salience frameworks limit me and that that was the core of [1529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1529.94s)

empirically what actually has been making them more effective so uh frequent periodic personal ooh of the ooda loops in an individual's way of looking at the world observe orientation decide to act when people say what's the solution they want to jump straight to decide and act without [1554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1554.0s)

understanding the observe orient well enough and then oftentimes they have frameworks like the answer is and they know what the answer is so then of course they have a hammer and they're looking for nails but it means that their observation is actually deadened because they have existing solution frameworks they're trying to apply so they're trying to look for which of my [1573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1573.08s)

existing solution framework supplies or where can i apply this thing and as a result their observation to novelties didn't so it was very interesting to see an environment that high consequence and that empirical where they were testing the  __  out of different training methods in you know live training scenarios [1591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1591.32s)

um coming up with the thing that messed the most qualified tactical operators up the most was them looking for solutions too quickly rather than being able to drop that and really actually assess the novelty of this situation so i just want to offer that first um because i do find that the impulse to jump straight to solution is an uncomfort with uncertainty [1615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1615.86s)

that doesn't want to actually not know what to do and feel like there's consequential stuff but that makes it more likely you do the wrong thing and it's more important to just be able to chill the  __  out enough that you can actually observe the real novel situation and come up with appropriate novel solutions and so the comfort with certainty the [1637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1637.88s)

comfort with uncertainty allows you to observe well which allows you to strategize well that's one prerequisite i want to share i like it it can be taken too far i've been chilling the  __  out and observing and orienting for 20 years on this uh before deciding and acting uh because that's kind of my job but i i totally agree with you i think there and this [1662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1662.539s)

ties into people's identity and their jobs as well it's hard to have a solution or a set a suite of responses that is countered to one's built identity or their paycheck yes i want to actually speak to uh two things there i talk about [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] oftentimes so um obviously if someone has a fiscal [1685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1685.1s)

incentive to externalize the cost they will blah blah but it's not just a [[perverse incentive]] in the traditional economic sense it's if my job is measured in certain metrics even if it's not a perverse fiscal incentive for me but i'm whatever i'm some un department focused on world food program focused on feeding kids or a refugee program focused on whatever the [1706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1706.039s)

metrics are bed nets i can do something that will feed the kids through an environmentally unsustainable strategy that erodes the soil faster and causes [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean faster because those are the metrics that i'm tasked with and so there i think of that as a institutional choice architecture that [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1728.6s)

is perverse to the totality of what the world needs so it's not just [[perverse incentive]] equals greed it's also that we can divide the world up into this is yours to focus on where well but that's  __  wrong if what i'm tasked with is just these few metrics and i can arm other things that are still interconnected me just actually doing what the institution requires of me optimizing those metrics even if they're for a non-profit good or government positive things seemingly positive things can still be a corrupt choice making architecture so one of the things you want to think about is is there a mandate that i have that is too narrow to think well to strategize [1768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1768.62s)

well is because when you were saying earlier some people care about narrow things well it's very likely that things that you don't think you care about directly affect the  __  you do care about if you don't think that you care about uh coral and oceans you're just wrong because when they die watch what happens to your life right if you don't think [1789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1789.2s)

you care about fluorinated surfactants passing [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] or nuclear issues you're wrong like you do care about those and so whatever you're focused on you still don't want to harm  __  that your life depends upon and that all the things that you care about depends upon so you have to make sure that your choice making architectures are not so [1806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1806.659s)

narrow that you can't actually think about what you're doing in context of everything else you don't have to be trying to solve everything but you do have to ensure that what you're doing here is consider it enough of the other areas that you're not causing externality there that's a first general principle and how do you do that great um someone listening to this do [1826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1826.88s)

that i want to come back to that i want to say one thing first but how do we avoid externalities one of the best topics we can do for solution thinking but what i wanted to say briefly first was just about you yes of course someone can do extended analysis and never act and as a result not be that effective and or even just [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1845.72s)

hold delusions for a long time because they don't test them in the world and realize empirically it was wrong or whatever of course i don't think that's your case at all like i want to just kind of acknowledge i don't think you think it is that there's so much importance on the [[climate change]] movement there's so many brilliant scientists associated with so [1865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1865.58s)

many climate research projects and yet the overall narrative is very focused on mostly co2 a little bit methane and you know greenhouse gases as a whole and temperature rising as a result of this and and the fact that that co2 is largely being produced by the burning of hydrocarbons that is also completely [1887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1887.6s)

attached to the growth of gdp that is also going to not be able to keep happening forever that portends a gazillion other  __  things it's a critical part of that whole story your extended analysis being able to emphasize that and now being able to tie that into all the other areas in this podcast i think is adding something more valuable to the world than if you had [1909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1909.2s)

been on the front line doing [[climate change]] work your whole life so i just want to thank you i mean i agree and the decide and act as i decided we need orders of magnitude more people thinking in systems and caring with uh empathy and reason and joining this conversation that was my decision and the podcast and my other work is the action so thank you for clarifying that i i kind of was you [1932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1932.779s)

know self-deprecating that i do uh observe and orient a lot uh yeah and you know learning from you and tristan and learning from other people about geopolitics and nuclear risks i mean i'm i'm still observing and orienting the world that we live in it is fascinatingly complex and fraught with [1954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1954.46s)

risk okay getting back where were we to some degree the ooda loop is not supposed to just live in an individual it's supposed to live in networks of people that are coordinating because you should have a soil scientist who is continuously learning more about how to effectively grow soil and what healthy soil is and [1981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=1981.5s)

you should have farmers that are taking that info and applying it in very practical ways and they're not doing an equal amount of observing and orienting versus deciding and acting so another principle that i would share is when you can't think about the whole problem set of the world and then think about you as if you for any individual are going to be able to act in some way sufficient to [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2002.559s)

the whole thing you should care about the whole thing but then you should care about lots of people's activity in service of that and so how do you relate in network you know with everyone else and there will be some people who are much more like look i can do  __  tell me what to do i can execute and there'll be people who are like i am don't know how to politically execute i don't have [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2021.399s)

good interpersonal skills i'm great researcher in which case it's like this is what i mean about typologies great figure out where you've where you actually can work your ass off all the time because you're you're enlivened by it you enjoy it so you can't really excel and develop novel capacities and be in partnership with other people with different capabilities [2040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2040.179s)

but the default of the [[exponential tech]] the exponential energy use and the metabolism of our system has self-organized those typologies in the service of optimizing dollars or financial markers as our objective so the typologies have all been structured in a way that is not helpful to the future that we face and so those typologies have to switch into maybe a [2067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2067.72s)

different objective or parallel objective yeah i mean we talked about this in number two i think is that um money equals optionality to do lots of things so money is a decentralized incentive system to incentivize people to figure out how to get better at making it and which means novelty search [2091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2091.24s)

and optimization do a better job of whatever you already figured out how to do and obviously you can make money via production but also extraction you can make money via value adding but also externalization of cost and um so when we're talking about organizing towards these other purposes [2110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2110.44s)

right towards a fundamentally different master you might still have to figure out how to pay your bills but it's not what is motivating you still you will need to be in coordination with other people who are similarly motivated to you but have different capacities now can we come back to externalities how to avoid externalities okay this this is [2132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2132.339s)

um i think there's a couple topics that i want to mention before we get into the three by three so one is how to avoid externalities causing or causing other problems in the process of trying to solve a problem the other is how to avoid feeling that the thing that you're doing is important enough that you have enough passion over it that you don't [2155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2155.26s)

under emphasize how important many other things are um and both of these speak to a kind of holisticness of consideration so first on externality i'm not going to give the examples of how trying to solve one problem causes others because we did that already in the conversation so go listen to it but it is almost everything [2176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2176.56s)

um it's so easy to say we can bring electricity to these people by burning more coal or making a hydroelectric dam that will extinct all these species in this area on the river or blah blah blah whatever it is now i'm not going to say there is no such thing as trade-offs it is a childish view to pretend there are no trade-offs what i'm saying is if you don't care about all the things if you [2196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2196.9s)

haven't monitored all the things that are involved and care about them all you will make unnecessarily bad trade-offs and then the process you will also polarize the people that care about those things so of course it is mature to realize there will be some trade-offs but at least consciously look at and care about all of them and come up with the best synergistic satisfier as you [2214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2214.42s)

can the thing that serves all the things that matter as best as possible so on the topic of externalities how do you uh how do you think through actually i just wrote up a list of questions that i think help people think through how to understand the [[problem space]] and how to understand a solution space i'll send it to you as a document so you can include it in the show notes for this before we get the externalities it asks questions like if you're looking at a problem whether it's health care in my town or you know too many isrogenic deaths at my hospital or why there are so many uh so much soil erosion in this area or so much government corruption or whatever [2256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2256.72s)

it is um in the assessment there are questions that are universally relevant like where in this system are there [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] just see if we start to map where anyone has a financial incentive or a status incentive or uh cover your ass incentive that is not aligned with doing the maximally good things of the whole and honesty just by starting to [2276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2276.16s)

notice that and not in a partisan way right in the bipartisan all directions way you'll start to be like oh well of course this thing isn't going well because there are these [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] um the biggest [[perverse incentive]] of all is profits as our cultural goal which means i can buy this iphone for 400 500 but if [2297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2297.76s)

you included the external costs it would be five thousand dollars and a lot more people wouldn't be able to afford it so the fact that the externalization of cost to the environment and poor people is what allows the market to exist and that if we actually had to do the accounting and pay all of the costs so that we weren't [2325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2325.18s)

stealing from anyone's balance sheet that the market wouldn't exist and that um would look radically different i'm not sure it wouldn't exist but go on it wouldn't exist as it does right like it not any area as they exist currently would be profitable everything would have to get restructured in some very [2343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2343.9s)

deep ways um i think any anyone who's ever become a like artisan craft person and made stuff and then thinks about how cheap factory stuff is like god damn how like shut stuff should not be that cheap like it should we should have much less things that are much more expensive and much more oriented to reuse and durability [2362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2362.079s)

and um so yes that is one of the very deep [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] but that means for any particular problem you're looking at look at within your area where there are fiscal [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] that particularly go against the problem you're trying to solve because those are that's where the opposition is going to come and then you can start to think [2380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2380.859s)

through can we use law to bind this can we use collective [[value system]] in a cultural forcing function to bind this can we use a different profit motive and make them a healthier profit motive where people are willing to pay for a more expensive thing because it's better you know um so being able to say the humans that are doing the thing have some [2401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2401.56s)

motivators can we look at the human motivators across the system and align them with the thing we're trying to do better that's just a question that it's very good for people to get good at thinking through another one is someone is thinking about a problem and you think through what are all the problems upstream from this problem [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2419.079s)

so they contribute to it let's say we're dealing with a [[factory farm]] issue well people's [[value system|value systems]] and not caring about animals enough is one language and sanitizing and calling it beef or pork rather than cows or animals the invisibility is part of the problem putting it far away where nobody can see it as opposed to having taxi interact with it's part of the problem the financial incentives are part of the problem that and so if your solution whatever the solution is there's one thing but it doesn't address many of those things those things are still going to show up somehow right like the classic example i give of when the poachers couldn't poach the elephant but they were still poor [2458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2458.56s)

you still had a macro economy that created poverty they were in poverty they were still a black market on animal products they just moved to hunting other animals that were more endangered if you don't want to protect the elephant and kill the rhino then or have the renault get killed because those butchers have to move you have to deal with the poverty upstream you have to [2473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2473.56s)

deal with the mindset towards animals you have to deal with the mindset of the people buying the product so um that might not be something you can immediately execute on but you have to know that whatever solution i'm doing right now is a partial solution is not a full solution and if i don't work towards a full solution i might just displace that problem [2490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2490.24s)

so if someone can do an analysis of here's a problem what are all the things upstream from it can i factor how to work on all of them that's one question i have more but you're about to say something on that one well i was just going to say that since we started this series um one of the language changes that i've [2511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2511.06s)

incorporated is i no longer talk about solutions i talk about responses and there's a million responses rather than a discrete solution so just minor clarification but but keep going keep going although i fear there may be episode 6 daniel's 3x3 grid and episode 5 is the preface to daniel's 3x3 grid but keep going richard haas that [2538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2538.599s)

uh head over at cfr rights out the difference between problems and predicaments and solutions versus management and that's a good framework that uh problems i know of his work i've not read that the problem is um discreetly frameable and admits a complete solution uh predicament doesn't emit a complete solution it admits [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2558.94s)

ongoing management because there will be conflicting forces or conflicting trade-offs or whatever um so yeah even just the reductive thinking about a solution as if it's a static thing and then it's done in a situation that is very complex is itself not thinking adequately so yes um so you think about so here's a problem or your predicament the [2580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2580.839s)

situation you're wanting to improve you think about all the stuff upstream you also want to think about all the things downstream if i whatever solution that i'm looking at doing will have effects other than just a few intended ones this is the one of the key insights is that when we cause when we generate a solution whether it's a new piece of tech that will solve the [2598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2598.96s)

problem or a new law or a new business or a new movement typically what we're doing is defining the problem in a narrow way right the problem is soil erosion in this area the problem is uh the homelessness in this area whatever it is or the the problem is cancer and so we need to do the immuno oncology we define a [2621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2621.64s)

problem some narrow way and then we seek a solution that produces a first order meaning a direct effect to solve it right typically we're not looking for cancer solutions that decrease carcinogenesis at large we're looking for something that can cut a cancer out or burn a cancer out or poison the cancer out or tune an immune system to killing cancers we're not [2644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2644.319s)

looking highly upstream so we're almost always looking for a direct effect right on whatever the problem is so it's a first order effect on a narrowly defined problem that we will think about so that we can measure for doing a good job in a small number of metrics right we'll have how many cancer cells [2663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2663.819s)

or how many inches of topsoil or how many parts per million of co2 or whatever it is and or how much gdp per capita but we're going to be measuring our success in a small number of fully explicated metrics from a first order effect that's actually quite simple epistemologically to wrap your head around but that solution that i do will also [2683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2683.74s)

produce second and third and nthorter effects on a very large number of metrics that we've never thought about and some of those will not be positive and some of them if this solution is going to overtake the problem it has to be bigger or faster have some more scale to it some of those externalities might actually be worse issues aren't you just really saying that our [2706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2706.66s)

species has chosen to simplify our economy on the backs of 500 billion energy workers and we optimize dollars when we should somehow mature to have a systems view of upstream and downstream effects and if we did try to measure those second and third and nthorter effects the risk and the complexity would be so much that we would just grind everything to a halt no i uh that's not true that we would grind everything to a halt um okay though that will that though that will be the justification for why to continue with the stupid thing um so but am i saying something that is very much like men are not the web of life we are stranded at whatever we do to the [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2755.8s)

web we do to ourselves think about seven generations into the future think more holistically yes i'm saying something like that but i'm going to try to actually make it more formalizable so that you can actually think about how to apply it not just feel it right but it is it's saying something very commensurate to that when when david bowman krishnamarti had their [2773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2773.98s)

dialogues in the 80s on what is the fundamental cause of all of the [[metacrisis]] the way they talked about what's the fundamental cause of human conflict that leads to poor coordination and poor management and david baume said it was fragmented consciousness the underlying issue was being able to separate us versus them and benefit us at the expense of them but they're just [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2793.839s)

as smart and they upregulate stuff and so we just get [[arms race|arms races]] to make the the wars larger and larger in their potential or me versus you so we get class systems and everybody  __  each other even within the us right like we'll be in us when it comes to this nation versus that nation but we'll be at me verse or in us when it comes to our company versus [2814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2814.599s)

their company but me versus you when it comes to ladder climbing within the company and office politics um or our species versus the other species in the earth or the right now benefit relative to the long-term harm the ability to separate things that are in truth connected to benefit one part while harming another part but that ultimately those causal loops come back [2835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2835.839s)

to harm everything the cause of all the problems is that it is a consciousness that doesn't see how it all connects see how it all connects and then you tend to all of it only then only that is considerate enough to manage the power of [[exponential tech]] go ahead naive question so the fractured [2860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2860.38s)

consciousness is that a human thing or do dogs and elephants have fractured consciousness no human thing yeah um the capability to take this whole totality of experience and then start naming everything and making things separate right having a semantic interface being able to have [2887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2887.02s)

a symbol that i can relate to into that relates to the represents the ground but it's not the ground this is what makes us so powerful is because we can upregulate one part relative to another part right our [[tool making]] is the ability to take my fist and say i want more of that make a hammer right a stone tool or take my ability to bite something and make a [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2907.599s)

sharp knife or um it's the ability to say i want more of this part and how do i increase it but increase it at the expense of what what is becoming less what where is the cost happening if our technology is not that much and there's not that many of us so what when our technology becomes profound and there's lots of us then it's a big so [2926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2926.92s)

what then the us versus them can equal a war that kills everybody and the us versus nature equals [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] it kills everybody so the same consciousness that was viable because there were not that many of us and our tech was not that big but the poor stewardship of tech the poor stewardship of our power meaning poor in terms of whatever we're [2948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2948.94s)

externalizing the harm to um that same mindset does not get to steward exponential power it's [[self-terminating]] yes so either if we are to not self-terminate we must have the wisdom to be able to steward exponential power and into something like exponentially more wisdom than we have been operating with and it's not impossible but it is and [2972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2972.94s)

this is where we said culture political economy tech there is some radical cultural shifts that have to occur to instantiate a political economy that is the will of the people but where the will of the people doesn't is not a well that wants to benefit some people at the expense of others and some people in the moment at the expense of our future and people of the expensive nature if the [2992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=2992.56s)

government that is going to bind the tech and the economics is not an instantiation of the will of the people it'll be oppressive and then it has to justify violence to oppress the people and then it'll become corrupt and whatever so the government has to be an expression of the people but if it's a will of the people who want what harms each other that also [3011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3011.22s)

doesn't work so you have to basically do the culture work to have people recognize that which they are fundamentally interconnected with to then be able to have that expressed in a system of law that binds the economics that can bind guide and direct the tech which is where the physical power is to be viable that conceptually makes sense should we [3036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3036.44s)

move into the three by three grid then and how should we okay almost i don't know okay on externalities it's important to say so how do you think through externalities better to avoid them so we were saying think through the upstream stuff because if you don't solve some of the upstream causes of the problem it's very likely they will be displaced [3061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3061.079s)

somewhere else think about the downstream stuff of whatever you're going to do so that you aren't going to cause problems to something else that matters okay could you give us an example of that upstream and downstream on the level of the individual and a product or something sure i'm wanting to bring food to people in an area where there's food insecurity is my strategy going to increase the power of warlords to be able to capture huge surpluses of food and increase that type of um uh political and civility in the area is it going to create increased dependency on other countries that are going to actually erode the culture of the people feeling like they have any [3107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3107.16s)

agency is it going to use agricultural methods that actually kill more pollinators and more topsoil and cause more [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans those are not the core problem i was trying to solve i was trying to solve food insecurity but i don't want to make warlords worse i don't want to erode the will of the people saying they have no agency i don't want to ruin the environment so i [3124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3124.44s)

have to say how do i think about this problem and the how do i think about the connected problems well enough because can i bring sustainable agriculture [[permaculture]] type things that don't hurt the soil actually make the soil better and grow it rather than not that are inherently decentralizing rather than centralizing so they don't cause the warlord thing they increase the agency [3144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3144.18s)

of the people it just means we have to deepen the understand standing of the [[problem space]] enough to notice which solutions will be valuable you're really talking about embedding [[systems thinking]] systems ecology in a central role in our governance systems but we have no incentive to be systems thinkers in our culture right now [3174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3174.059s)

unless you're a hedge fund or a teacher well two things not all motivation is extrinsic incentive is an extrinsic motivator where someone else is getting you to do something and where i'm doing it because of what i get out of it not because of my intrinsic motivation to the thing itself so if i am trying to run a civilization [3198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3198.119s)

where there's a lot of labor to do and nobody really wants to do all the labor and so we have to incent them to do the labor because otherwise we have to beat them to do the labor you know like so we can end slavery by having the wage slavery or something like that but people aren't doing the things they want to do it they're doing the things they want the money for you know some [3217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3217.92s)

other purpose intrinsic motivism is also a thing right so people's [[value system|value systems]] the culture work is i do certain things not because i'm going to get anything financially from it or necessarily even status from it but because i just intrinsically care about the thing right so one is we're talking i think most of the people listening are spending hours [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3240.48s)

listening to this thing and they're not getting paid to listen to this and some of them might be taking this to their job as a consultant because they sound smarter and they get paid but probably mostly not probably they're investing time doing this because they just authentically care independent of incentive so and there's a culture-wide starved for intrinsic motivation and [3262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3262.7s)

purpose right now but go on the future is defined much less by extrinsic motivators and much more by intrinsic motivators this doesn't mean there will be any extrinsic ones so of course we have to design our incentives and our deterrents better we have to solve for [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] and like that but that that's not the whole of the story it shouldn't even be [3286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3286.68s)

most of the story right um and then there is also an incentive to care about these things which is non-extinction is a good incentive like just even from a personal extrinsic point of view if i don't work to take to affect the world's trajectory and if i don't work to help other people to affect the world's trajectory it might [3310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3310.74s)

preclude anything that i care about um so i would say there is not an incentive in the formal monetary systemic sense for a lot of people but that does not mean that there is not both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons if you pay attention okay okay so we were saying upstream downstream things externalities we were [3336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3336.54s)

saying the solution is generally oriented to produce a first order effect on a small number of defined variables but we have to think through the second third fourth order effects on a large number of variables that we don't know what are how do we do that the first part is i want people to endeavor to do it completely well knowing they never can your best externality analysis will still miss  __  that there's no way you could have thought of but i want you to try to think of everything as best you can and then knowing that you didn't think of everything i want you to have some kind of broad listening and watching after you do it to see what might be being affected that you [3376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3376.559s)

wouldn't have even expected and um did we expect when smartphones came out that they would have the effect on dinner tables or human attention in relationships or porn addiction or people's ability to study or we didn't expect those things so and we might have anticipated some to anticipate all the [3398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3398.579s)

things you can but also maybe even in the visual human focal length of focusing on 2d things at a fixed focal length so much of the time and the effect of losing our navigation and orientation and what other things that does neuropsychologically so what i would say is you have to do the best job of anticipating externalities you can [3420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3420.3s)

while recognizing there will be ones you didn't anticipate so you want some very broad diffuse listening to say after we started this thing what's what new things started to occur that might have been connected are you kind of talking about the precautionary principle totally um but i'm talking about specifically [3440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3440.46s)

how to think about applying it right and so we're talking about a holistic principle and a precautionary principle but we're trying to formalize it as like a way that people can think about applying this thing so first how do you think through the externalities on second third fourth order effects by talking to more people with different [3461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3461.76s)

perspectives about the thing as the first really key part this is where diversity of perspective and pluralism is really a real thing if i'm thinking okay i'm going to solve this issue or i'm going to protect this area of the amazon from being harmed by this combination of law regarding mining rights and regarding agricultural rights and etc okay cool sounds good go talk to the indigenous people about the solution and they'll be like no no there are some other groups that did things like that and here's what happens the the they just hire mercenaries to do this thing or it gets worse for this reason or whatever and you're like oh  __  i didn't know that and go talk to the legal scholars and [3504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3504.059s)

they're like oh there's no way to implement this in law because of such and such and go talk to the economists who are like law is written by lobbyists and they have more money to keep writing law than you do you're going to lose this one and go um you go talk to the environmental scientist and they'll be like actually you're protecting the wrong part of the [3519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3519.42s)

forest it's not even high biodiversity here relative to this area and so there's a lot of people who will know stuff that you don't know and they won't be able to see where some of the externalities will occur including people that are on the opposite political side of the thing right whoever would fight against it there's something that they care about [3541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3541.5s)

that is real even if they're wrong about some stuff they're not wrong about 100 of everything so finding out why do they not like it and say how can i factor that in so one i can not cause the problems for them and as a result decrease their enmity and maybe get them as allies rather than fighting the thing right you'll become more successful and it'll be a better solution [3559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3559.02s)

so the way to think through externalities better is when you come up with a possible solution talk to lots of people about what might be wrong with it so red team it but then don't give up say ask them okay how would you make it better to still serve the thing i'm wanting to serve but to improve the thing that you're seeing and so you use it as a proposition or [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3576.48s)

design refinement process and so that's the first part and then the second part is once you implement it try to implement it in experimental ways right you have some safe to fail probes you don't implement the largest thing possible okay i think we figured out that this this version of ai or this genetically modified organism is safe let's just [3598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3598.559s)

 __  take it everywhere maybe our safety experiments were not totally complete let's do contained experiments so the first thing is think through it well right which you can't do on your own the next part is run some experiments and try to if you missed stuff that will show up in the experiment try to do it in a contained way right and then as you implemented at [3616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3616.619s)

scale there will still be stuff that you missed so have a broad listening and ensure that when you find where something is being harmed and you need to change the strategy it doesn't mean you stop it means you update it that you maintain the governance capacity to do so that you haven't turned it over to where now that it's initiated the fiduciary responsibility to shareholders [3637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3637.619s)

means you can never change that thing or whatever i mean ensure that the governance structure is such that when we learn new stuff the underlying thing can be changed and when you say you who do you mean by you have to do anything right we're talking to people here because on the chance that people here are going to try to they're running a non-profit or [3657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3657.9s)

they're running a institution or they're wanting to build a thing if you are wanting to do things these are things to keep in mind and if you are supporting someone who has more agency than you in the organization or whatever these are things you would help support them with so i haven't heard you frame this holistic precautionary logic of the last few minutes did you just like have a [3681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3681.78s)

sandwich yesterday and come up with this or actually this is the thing that i would arguably like to start with some but if someone doesn't have the [[metacrisis]] frame they don't yet it's not obvious that the way we try to solve problems is the cause of the other problems and is a major part of the [[generator function]] of the [[metacrisis]] and so once you've understood that then you can be like okay so a part of how we solve it is by a much more holistic set of frames in how we go about doing things um now i don't think this is impossibly hard to teach or train i think this should be being trained in k-12 education at various levels of development i think that people who are [3729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3729.059s)

learning anything from design science to becoming technologists to being lawyers or studying political economy should be thinking and being trained in these things and thinking through the specifics in their domains okay now the next part is i want to identify two types of externalities physical externalities and psychosocial externalities a physical externality is where we do something to benefit we do something that has a physical effect to benefit something the part of the [[supply chain]] of that thing happening causes some physical harm somewhere right so we want water repellent coats and water repellent umbrellas and everything like that and we want to industrial surfactants so we make [3774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3774.9s)

um fluorinated surfactants to be able to do that but then they go into the water supply and they're forever chemicals and they never break down in their carcinogens and endocrine disruptors and neurotoxins so that's a you know where we want an herbicide to make agriculture more effective but it messes up the soil bacteria and uh human [3794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3794.46s)

health and whatever those are classic examples of physical externalities obviously co2 and [[climate change]] is a physical externality no one is intending to cause [[climate change]] they just want to generate energy so everybody knows physical externalities they didn't used to but rachel carlson and friends kind of [3813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3813.66s)

got people thinking about that now i think everybody is at least somewhat aware but that the [[supply chain|supply chains]] that make anything happen have lots of effects that's physical externalities just like a a point on that is the physical benefits we get in terms of profits or services um aren't on equal footing with the [3838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3838.74s)

negative externalities that rachel carson warned about and and others because those things happen in the future and we're a biological species so emotionally they have and culturally they have very little weight in our brains so that's why this stuff has happened because our capitalist exponential system has backloaded some of those [3859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3859.92s)

costs that are second third order effects from our decisions and our products right i'd actually like to explain a few reasons why it happened so one is a lot of the harms will occur in the future but the benefits occur now and so there is a a perverse orientation to now it's also that whoever does the thing that provides more advantage now [3882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3882.059s)

probably wins having more power to influence the overall system and those who don't do the thing that will cause the future harm also don't get the power and then don't influence the whole system so there's a [[perverse incentive]] not just a psychological bias there's also a game theoretic [[perverse incentive]] to do that thing um it's also true that as we were mentioning earlier making a tech that produces a certain benefit is epistemologically easier than preventing all of the harms from doing so because creating a first order effect on a small number of metrics is just epistemically easier than considering nthorter effects on a very large number of undefined [3923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3923.819s)

metrics so there is also something episamically about it and then um the other thing is that many of the problems only occur through very large-scale cumulative action but the individual action produces my benefit if i cut this tree down i get money from the lumber have just as much air to breathe it's [3947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3947.16s)

everybody cutting it down that messes up the atmosphere but me not cutting this tree down doesn't make any seeming difference to the atmosphere but it does make a difference to my balance sheet so do you have the comments each person the risk reward ratio orients them to do the thing because the collective because the harm is more collective and the benefit is [3970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3970.799s)

more personal you have to factor all of those asymmetries um and then one version of this that i want to point out for people is that there's obviously many narratives that type will make everything better ai will solve all of our problems and um healthcare is going to become awesome with genetic engineering and immuno [3993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=3993.18s)

oncology and all those things and um nanotech is going to make environmentally friendly everything manufacturing um and capitalism makes things better there's obviously many narratives like the environment is  __  and every positive thing was the result of first it was only positive for a few and the [4013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4013.46s)

result of colonialism and etc there's partial truth to both of these um and there's obviously risks associated with ai that some people are aware of and benefits or of any tech but there is a [[perverse incentive]] that's worth paying attention to that those who focus on the opportunity more than the risk will get ahead more than those that focus on avoiding the risk more than [4034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4034.22s)

their advancement of the opportunity even even in our hunter-gatherer days that was probably true and well even more now because the hunter if he did something too risky might have died now i socialize the losses of the risk i can declare bankruptcy um jail the limited liability corporation is just going to take a bit [4054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4054.98s)

of a loss whatever so i get to privatize the gains and socialize the losses we can do an oil spill it's not going to hurt me as the executive but i am going to make money when i exploit more oil yeah uh yeah so the ability to privatize gains socialize losses um the ability to cause some new tech facebook [[social media]] destroying democracy in the social contract and the [[epistemic commons]] and yet no accountability for that thing but just a  __  ton of profit um i can always say afterwards oh there's no way we could have known but nobody tried to do the external calculus that i'm mentioning and or to [4098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4098.42s)

the degree that anyone did they said shut up we don't want to hear that and the focus was that's going to be amazing it's going to connect the world it's going to whatever the narrative of you're being too negative let's focus on the opportunity whoever runs that narrative will get wealthier and be able to upregulate the narrative and show the success and [4116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4116.0s)

highlighting the thing well you've just described while i'm why i'm poor and still teaching but go on so there is this as we move forward toward the tech now where one the we can't keep externalizing costs to the commons because we're too close to [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and the world is too fragile and two the new tech is way too  __  powerful the speed at which [4138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4138.98s)

everyone got smartphones compared to the speed at which everyone got railroad or the plow right it was like thousands of years for the whole world to get the plow you know 100 years for a railroad less than 10 years on the phone it's like the speed and scope of impact and then you start to think about genetically modified or you know synthetic biology and ai [4159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4159.98s)

we can't keep externalizing exponential we can't keep externalizing harm with [[exponential tech]] so we have to get much more  __  careful on the risk reward side and get less reward seeking and willing to externalize risk as a whole society if we're going to make it we actually have to get much more conscious of that and the default in 47 years is one human [4182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4182.719s)

is worth a quadrillion dollars everyone else is serfs and it's a dead planet music um yeah that's one of the features that we're not that interested in um okay where are we i interrupted you a couple times are you on on track you had another part of the externalities that i kicked you off your professional [4212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4212.54s)

externalities psychosocial they are physical externalities and the physical externalities were clear on they produced a physical harm on the environment or human health right the psychosocial externality um and and they're not always perfectly preventable sometimes that you have to manage them like i'm on a laptop right [4232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4232.219s)

now one of the externalities of the convenience of being able to carry this computer as opposed to a desktop is that it's going to mess my neck up and almost everybody today has neck issues because they look down too much and we're not supposed to look down physiologically evolutionarily that much so at home set your monitor up and you get the proper you know c curvature in the cervical [4252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4252.4s)

vertebra i might not be able to have the benefit of portability and not have that but i can at least say all right well don't be lazy and stay on the laptop when i get home really do get a raised monitor or so the physical externalities don't only look like effects on the environment they also look like the ergonomic effects and the behavioral effects and [4272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4272.36s)

lots and lots of things a tiny tiny observation i knew everything you just said but the social mirror neuron cultural evolution while you were saying that i straightened up in my chair a little bit subconsciously so thanks funny how that works so the psychosocial externality is that my technology or my movement or my whatever might also [4296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4296.0s)

affect have an effect on people's experience people's uh emotions beliefs identities not just individually which has a psychological effect but collectively which has a sociological effect and i'll give a couple examples one of the biggest examples is anything that has to do with trying to win the minds and hearts of people right like how do we [4323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4323.12s)

um get people to really care about the [[climate change]] the mask wearing the vaccine the whatever the thing is um typically we and particularly recently egregiously we focus on who our intended audience is and how to be able to get a political effect from that intended audience and we don't focus that much on how the people that will not agree with this respond [4351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4351.62s)

and there are many reasons for this in the u.s which has such an outsized media influence on much of the rest of the world um the nature of a bipartisan political situation and not having something like ranked choice voting is such that uh putting the other candidate down is actually and saying how bad they [4376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4376.159s)

are and it'll be catastrophic if they get in is is actually a very empirically effective way to get people to vote or at least it has been um but of course that other side then does the same thing if one side figured out a really effective communication strategy the other side makes some innovations comes back so one side gets in and they do [4394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4394.94s)

whatever they do for four years the other side comes in and then undoes all that for four years and most of the energy of the whole system just goes to inviting waste heat and no long-term continuity so what we're we have to stop that  __  that is so critical so one thing for anyone who's [4412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4412.58s)

developing solutions that involve communication that involve any kind of public perception is to think about whose main intended audience awesome you know what do i want them to understand and maybe do but who is not my intended audience and who's going to not like this message and what are they going to do and am i radicalizing them am i polarizing them am i making them feel [4432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4432.56s)

like what they care about is going to be attacked where they're more likely to become terrorists and you know are more likely to whatever that's an effect that's an externality of my choice i might have made a choice that seemed like coalescing these people to do this thing was good but i actually just upregulated extremism or terrorism or total polarization in a critical [4452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4452.719s)

audience and so um one very simple but this gets back to your example though that if you can get rich or elected from doing that and you have made extremes of your enemies who cares as long as you win is the current logic and so what i'm saying is if your politician is doing that and you actually care about the world more [4477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4477.8s)

largely they are the wrong they have the wrong logic that's not the thing to support and if you are working to do a non-profit thing or whatever and there's a media campaign involved don't do that thing so of course the world is where it is because the things we're talking about are not widely practiced understood or implemented there is a huge amount of [4498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4498.62s)

political side correct and um but since you cannot actually kick the other half of the world off the planet and since they aren't just inert pieces of wood they do they are smart people with goals and values they're political actors and um if if they if what you say [4520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4520.58s)

anti-resonates with them and they get up regulated to do a bunch of action so it's true that when you villainize somebody else you can coalesce a bunch of people against them and you can actually have moral people be willing to celebrate causing harm to others that's very effective politically it's it also happens to be evil um calling women witches allowed [4542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4542.3s)

seemingly moral people to burn them to death right and calling somebody terrorists or whatever like i don't think we've i don't think we've evolved that much from the burning witches era i i wish people understood like the the lynching was not long ago right the lynching as like a of entertainment was not long ago the burning witch is the [4565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4565.64s)

the concentration camps of world war ii the i mean there's still  __  like that happening today so how quickly you know when you when you look at the pictures of women wearing mini skirts in 1968 neuron and you know then the the thing that happened in the ayatollah and then the burkas when you look at how it well relatively advanced [4589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4589.94s)

liberia was and then the internal war and then child soldiers were placing what had been a economically prosperous area when you look at syria recently like if you when you look at ukraine you can have an area that seems peaceful and economically prosperous progressive and liberal and it collapses and turns into war violence extremism you know etc it goes from any skirts to burcas to [4613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4613.88s)

whatever and so those are canaries in a coal mine of something that is possible for anywhere in the world people should in recognition of that not take for granted this the stability of where they are and and not taken for granted or to protect it that's the purpose of our work i i totally agree keep going so you the making they are anti-vaxxers is another word for which or terrorist right or on the other side they're sheeple or their libtards or whatever it is like both sides have their terms to dehumanize this might be politically expedient it is definitely moving us towards [4662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4662.48s)

planetary extinction as a whole stop this if you are doing that thing you are definitely not part of the long-term solution you're orienting a short-term narrow thing at the expense of increasing enmity polarization etc so this is a place where the externality is psychosocial so one thing i want to think about is who cares about this issue and then who cares about another [4684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4684.92s)

issue that feels threatened by this that's in this area of trade-offs what do they care about how do i come up with a solution that could get more broad support and less enmity it's just a more effective strategy also unless i don't care that the thing i work real hard for gets undone in four years um but there are no groups of people that feel really good about being [4704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4704.719s)

villainized and that will just sit comfortably and let the thing that villainize them continue to succeed so um that's one example of a psychosocial externality which is where you are um trying to create fervency of belief in some population without really paying attention to what you're doing in that process through [4727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4727.28s)

another part of the population at year end 22 daniel the externalities in our world are legion both physical and psychosocial and you know that philosophically and emotionally i completely agree with what you're saying but we are a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the intellectual discourse on the web and the people that [4757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4757.64s)

are listening to you right now um of course they agree with the sentiment of what you're advocating but the reality is this energy hungry [[superorganism]] with the tragedy of the commons and exponential everything that is what are the lever points to start to change if you buy into what you're advocating which i certainly do you and i know that [4783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4783.08s)

the [[superorganism]] you know there's 70 to 100 trillion dollars that trades hands every day that pretty much every one of those dollars has some externality associated with it that's a problem and there's an exponential [[embedded growth obligation]] on it which means exponential future externalities that are attached to the thing and hitting the fragility points [4809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4809.78s)

of [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] like what we're up against is a big thing and not only are people not educated to think and feel and care and understand holistically and like that but they are continuously engaged in a media environment that will do everything that it can to capture them in a partisan political outrage whatever kind of way [4833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4833.0s)

and they will actually use ai split testing to figure out what  __  does that the most effectively in terms of what will show up in their news feed so the fact that we are dealing with some big issues here is obvious right like yeah the cards are kind of stacked in a rough direction um that now what is the what is the thing we need [4857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4857.0s)

the most of i think people that are oriented i think everything we've been talking about today people who are oriented with a very high touch like i actually care about sentient beings and want their life to be good and i'm not just interested in talking about topics that have power associated i'm not interested in just [4878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4878.0s)

virtue signalings green something because it make money in a fun that way i'm not like it grounds in mirror neurons right it grounds and i know what suffering feels like i see it there i want to solve it and i want to prevent it um people who are oriented that way who then also start learning how to be able [4898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4898.52s)

to think at scale well which means that it has to implement large numbers of people and technology and you know things in culture and the political economy and in tech right uh and that simultaneously think through these frameworks of how do i not jump to certainty in action too quickly but make sure i actually understand the problem [4922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4922.159s)

landscape the many things that are causing it the things that are downstream the people who care about something else and how do i come up with not a solution but a series of solutions that actually addresses this and progressively gets more people on board people that are capacitated this way is the rate limiting factor right now as far as i can see it [4941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4941.239s)

um there are people who care but have very poor strategy the people who understand strategy well are mostly serving very narrow aims so people who are kind of developed in these skill sets and this is why i'm excited to be talking about this with you here this is why we're working on in a training modules and an academy to be able to do this like etc [4961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4961.1s)

so in the 3x3 grid um culture political economy tech stack triage meaning urgent near-term transition and long-term education slash [[systems thinking]] is in all nine quadrants all nine boxes yeah so i'll say something else i said there was one other thing and it relates to this that i was going to say up front so [4991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=4991.94s)

one is how do you understand how to think about a solution in a way that will prevent unintended consequences um and that will be better set to to deal with in medicine the other thing i said i want to talk about was that people can get uh fundamentalist about their particular solution because if you're working on something you should really care about it but in really caring about it you can become overly narrowly focused so when i was first starting to try to wrap my head around like what is upstream from all of these various problems or what are the underlying causes that everything from [5035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5035.92s)

nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues what do these things have in common what do not a specific solution for one thing but a solution for civilization doing better look like i of course read the work of people and also had the fortune to talk to a lot of people that had spent their life thinking about these things and work on [5053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5053.92s)

them and would ask their analysis and i got so many answers that sounded like this you know at the end of the day whenever somebody uses a phrase like that at the end of the day or the key is you can usually expect a reductionist thing to come next [5075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5075.76s)

um not always but you like you know sometimes you want to pay attention to that at the end of the day uh uh really the thing we have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing there's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military-industrial complex is the largest block of a global economy [5095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5095.08s)

that you could ever have peace there's an anti-incentive on it as long as there's so much money to be made with mining etc like we have to fix the nature of economic incentives i'd be nodding i'm like this makes perfect sense right and somebody else would be like you know the core of the thing that we have to address is [5112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5112.36s)

education because you can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up different as as different as it is learning chinese is your first language versus learning english we're so neuroplastic by the time we're adults we're not that neuroplastic we're kind of screwed if you get education right we want adults who care about the [5133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5133.84s)

animals and the oceans and the contend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education right we'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that and like i'm nodding i'm like oh yeah this is it and then somebody else would be like oh really the thing is it's about media because we're continuously being bombarded and that was before [[social media]] then it was [[social media]] we're being continuously bombarded and we were ready to go do a capital riot or a george floyd protester riot or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in if we could change the media environment of what people were in taking it would change all of these things and then someone else like no no the thing is really at the end of the [5169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5169.9s)

day it's about government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get carbon pricing properly and get cost of everything proper all that would be fixed but we have to do that through law so how do we fix governance and law and [5188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5188.8s)

then somebody else will be like you can't because laws written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is is what's going to pay for that which is why you you have to think about economics and a lot of the other so the key is political economy and how do you get that so and on and on people would say no really the key is actually [5207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5207.46s)

parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education by the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and [[value system]] has already said it happens early on we have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning and what i came to learn is they were [5225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5225.219s)

all right right somebody else would be everything you're saying is so anthropocentric the key is the  __  environment because we're none of us are anything without the environment like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much and like what is an economy like we can breathe without money we can't breathe without air and so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything and so what i what i learned was the answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions um there is not a theory of chains there's an ecology of theories of change it's so often when someone says what is the solution it sounds like someone's [5263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5263.38s)

saying like what species is the forest like i don't know what you're even asking like a forest is lots of species lots and lots and if it's an old growth forest it's even more complexly interacting so what is the solution there's not a solution there's lots of things that need to happen so if anything i want patterns of how to think about it and i want frameworks for how [5283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5283.9s)

to think about it and i don't want people to attached to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting and to realize the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities yeah you know in the political economy aspects involve [5304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5304.239s)

lots of things and so and um the getting past the zealotists and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together is key to understanding properly i love that i got the systems ecology equivalent of goosebumps as you were unpacking that [5329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5329.38s)

um and that that's exactly right and but that's a lot for the that's a lot of complexity for most people to hold in their mind because they're they've worked their whole life on climate and they think climate is the single uh problem and their identity is attached to it their job is attached to it so to say it's all these things [5353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5353.739s)

governance and love and law and pricing and everything that you just mentioned how does someone shift from where they are now to that more holistic uh view of our of our system not only to think about it but also to apply it uh to their work and their lives i don't know if you want to answer that now but i i'm curious if you are young and you're listening to [5382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5382.32s)

this and you're thinking about how do i do the most useful thing with my life and do i go to college or not or do i go back to college or what kind of work do i do um for most people here's something i would offer figure out if you are not already [5400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5400.659s)

independently wealthy if you are awesome figure out how to keep your overhead as low as possible and make the money that you need to live in the least number of hours possible doing something that isn't terrible so you buy most of your time back to continue to train yourself on what is actually yours to do this is what i did with my life and many [5423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5423.159s)

of the people i know who i really respect did something like this where um you know i rather than okay i've got the basic bills paid let's make more money and get more  __  it's like no no the more  __  is way less interesting than actually the time i i want my time back so that i can keep [5442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5442.9s)

understanding these things so i can know how to have my life actually be meaningful and so it's both the learning and the development of capacity so if you are young still and you're in this interest figure out how to keep your overhead low figure out how to pay your bills in the least amount of hours doing something that isn't terrible and really keep investing in developing [5464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5464.5s)

how you and now if there's already something that you feel very called to do then and that feels right then do it and keep investing in your development in the additional hours both right if we're talking about someone who uh has kids in a mortgage and a job and whatever um if the job is not clearly making things [5487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5487.6s)

better in a way that is aligned with your dharma be willing to change it all like the shortness of your life and the urgency of the situation of the world is such that like be willing to do that if you're mostly in the right direction you just feel like you wish you could do even more then continue to do what you do while studying is there a way i could do this with even more insightfulness as [5512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5512.92s)

you start learning how to think through externalities and system dynamics better it might take a year or two of study while you're doing this to start to come up with insights but maybe in a few years you're actually revolutionizing the field that you're in um foreign the other thing i would say is [5528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5528.639s)

people when you say like hey it's a lot of complexity the world situations are complex reducing them to be too narrow is at the core of everything wrong we can optimize some things harm other things we have to and when we can act very powerfully because we can act through six continent [[supply chain|supply chains]] and supercomputers and satellites and ai and [5551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5551.26s)

um and steam engines and i mean uh oil engines and like all of the powerful tools from the [[industrial revolution]] on you just can't do that in an oversimplifying way ongoingly right like the where the model of what you're optimizing is not reality is where reality gets harmed you don't get to do cumulative and exponentially growing [5574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5574.96s)

harm forever on a finite world so we do have to actually wrestle with the reality of the world which means the complexity of it it is what it is we don't get a like it just is what it is right and now not everybody has to to begin with because we go back to each of those partial narratives it's just about media it's just about education just about [5594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5594.76s)

economics well let's say somebody is wrestling with all this and really thinking how do i make a better educational system and maybe they have maybe they have a transitional version and a long-term version right the long-term version might be like a radically different system of education that is based on a different system of community development where school is [5613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5613.659s)

not just a centralized thing it's how the parents and how the extended family and community are all supported to support the development of children right maybe that's some long-term future of education and maybe it involves ai tutors and  __  maybe the immediate transitional thing involves are there some curriculums in systemic thinking or whatever that we [5636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5636.28s)

can start to add to existing curricula and is there a way of getting that through that both requires me to think through the content the pedagogy and the political actuation needed to make it happen um not that many people have to be thinking effectively to get something to happen that will train a lot of people to where there's now a lot [5658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5658.48s)

more people in the same way that it didn't take that many people to make facebook to affect the minds of lots of people so it wouldn't take that many people to make new media systems that think strategically enough about how would we get metcalf dynamics and how do we get the people on there whatever that could be oriented very differently [5677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5677.98s)

and the same with [[perverse incentive]] if some people figured out how to if some people figure out how to make laws that make particularly bad things towards their current incentives illegal whether it's fishing or whatever or create better regenerative [[economic system|economic systems]] or then everybody else who doesn't understand the whole complexity just has a slightly less [[perverse incentive]] system like a lot of the complexities built into a better incentive system incentive legal system so not everybody has to get everything to begin with some people being able to do that and build things that affect other people at scale and affect the world at scale is how the thing starts so i don't want anyone who is wrestling with like okay i i want [5723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5723.52s)

to understand this well to get overwhelmed and they think about uh their family members who aren't even interested or whatever and say if everybody has to understand this we're screwed no everybody does not to begin and the path by which people are enculturated in time [5746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5746.8s)

can always start with some people building things that become on-ramps for more people so merging this with the logic of what i expect to happen which is a great simplification especially for young people what i hear you saying is advocating to simplify your own life in the current economy but at the same time expand your capacity to look at the [5776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5776.32s)

world in systems and not only the immediate feedback we get from a decision or a product or a strategy or a program but the second and third order effects and start to think that and if we have a scout team of consilience jedi out there that then that will potentially scale orders of magnitude in its passing the [5802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5802.3s)

system's baton to other humans over time and in turn that will affect all nine boxes of the three by three grid that you proposed yes totally and i want to just come back i don't know how many people who watch your show are young or um later everyone has uh it's a wide variety but a lot of young people so yeah i want to speak to younger [5827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5827.86s)

people again thinking about this um your development is uh personal and psychological as much as it is cognitive and skills really critical to understand that um if you can't talk whether it's can't publicly [5850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5850.36s)

speak or speak in front of someone who's intelligent because of insecurities it'll mess up your ability to do stuff no matter how much you know if you have to talk and you talk because you need to seem smart even when you should shut up and listen it's going to mess up your ability to do things we all can observe in other people these quirks that maybe they don't see in themselves [5870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5870.1s)

that totally make them less effective but keep going look for these things in yourself and see how to work on them so the the [[personal development]] is more study and more therapy um for whatever it's worth i did every therapy method i could ever find and i still actually if i find a [5892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5892.96s)

therapist that does something i haven't done i engage in it because it's just it's in investing in one's own understanding of themselves and their psyche is just like investing in their knowledge or investing in their health it matters the things we invest in is where grow so i would love to see it's also part of how can i how can i become undefended enough that i can actually [5915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5915.179s)

feel the pain of the world in a high touch way and not be crippled that also requires having worked through your own pain enough that you aren't crippled by it and regressed back into childhood trauma states and things like that we've had a couple off camera conversations on this i've never had therapy in my whole life and i'm now interviewing uh coaches in [5934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5934.12s)

the next couple weeks on this because i'm struggling with exactly what what you just described um so okay did you more more comments yeah yeah so some the great simplification macro so the micro version as you said is don't don't create an a [[embedded growth obligation]] on your own earning which is what most people do um the as soon as you make more than you get a bigger house and buy more  __  and have to get more debt and need to make more um stop the [[embedded growth obligation]] there because it really doesn't matter that much make enough money that you can eat healthy food and you know if you want to see a therapist or whatever you [5977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=5977.62s)

can do those things but by the way i i will interject right there there's a sociologist named julia shore she's a friend of mine she did a book like 30 years ago where she studied how much money people made and at the end of the year ask them how much would you like to make and they she followed a cohort over like 20 years and no matter how much you made in a certain year every single year [6001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6001.02s)

people wanted to make more the following year and if you internalize that's what our culture is doing the words you just said make even more profound sense keep going yeah the [[embedded growth obligation]] goes macro and micro right um but if you want to grow your own self and your own capacity to be in service of the world then you [6025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6025.86s)

can't be growing your service to the existing world maximally at the same time this is the two masters thing and you've got to decide which master are you actually in service of um and then you want to be actually doing good work you don't just want to be doing meditation and psychotherapy and study because one there's a lot that you only learn by doing stuff and you [6046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6046.44s)

want your life to be meaningful now and increasing your capacity for greater meaningfulness over time um and so as much as to the whole [[existential risk]] landscape it might not make sense to go be at the animal shelter or go helping with this frontline work if some of your life isn't doing that you're missing something um so the other thing i would say to young people is in addition to your own private study and your formal education the thing that will help the most is find mentors that are doing work that is most like the work you want to do and figure out what they need that you can become useful for this was the thing i'm most grateful for [6089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6089.94s)

in my own education was i had amazing mentors and i just figured out that they needed diapers changed or they needed construction or they needed whatever the hell it was and i just figured out how to learn how to do the things they needed so i could be around because you learned so much like you know if you get to go work with nate [6109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6109.8s)

and when he goes to dc and is talking with people about financial strategies for the energy grid or things like that you'll learn a lot about what actually happens in those rooms and how to think about it whatever that you just can't learn in college or online so um but if someone knows how to do the things you're interested in they're too busy so figure out what you can offer [6132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6132.42s)

that they need because then you'll be gaining the capacity to become more of what you want to be these are a few pieces of advice for younger people out at offer yeah the two bottlenecks there one you mentioned well they're we're in the liminal space between in my opinion a um growth on fumes world and a post-growth world there's a lot of people big [6158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6158.28s)

degrowth movement advocating for a smaller economy i think d-growth is what we should do but post growth is what we're going to have to do and i just don't think there's a lot of mentor like people out there in the post-growth space because our current master especially as things get more monetarily and civically stressful is we got to pay the bills so i i know you're not trying [6183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6183.06s)

to speak to everyone um and i think it's excellent excellent advice but there aren't a lot of people living and focusing on the projects that we're going to need in the next 10 or 20 years as potential mentors out there there are some for sure this is why the podcast is so cool as a format is it it allows people that you might not be able to access as a mentor [6208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6208.619s)

one-on-one for you to be able to get some meaningful chunk of what they have to share which is amazing but no there are people who are like it may be the the capacities you want don't live in any one person right maybe that you really want to protect the congo and that's going to require some amazing political strategy capability [6231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6231.739s)

but also some environmental knowledge and some cultural knowledge so it may be that there are some environmentalists that understand the biodiversity risks associated with the congo whatever well you need to study with them for a while to know that but there's also some just really effective political operators that are not working on that at all but where you get to learn how to [6251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6251.94s)

effectively get  __  done um in the political systems and you go study with them figuring out how to um be in proximity of the people that have capabilities you're wanting to develop is the fastest way to develop those capabilities okay getting to our three by three grid i think some of the things you've been speaking to the last 30 minutes or so populate many of the boxes in this grid um how how would you like to approach this so when i talk about triage transitioning in long-term adequate solutions sufficient solutions [6293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6293.699s)

um these are horizons of focus there's lots of management theories that talk about something like this but i'll tell you how i think about it the triage basically means that there is some problem and particularly some [[catastrophic risk]] that has a non-nell likelihood [6319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6319.98s)

over you know in the near term i'm mostly not focused on things like the sun blowing out someday i'm focused on pretty you know things within a within the years to decades time frame um and there's some problem like that that it does not seem the world has an adequate set of solutions already in place for so more needs done and probably needs done [6344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6344.94s)

fairly quickly through whatever means necessary to avoid that when i say whatever means necessary i mean not necessarily total systemic solutions but more just like direct implementation so if we are looking at something like the risks associated with the speed of growth of synthetic biology and and you know a direction of lots of viral hunting and gain of function research in league laboratories with publishing of those gene sequences that's just super super risky so things should be done to stop that that involved mostly uh some scientific work that says okay let's not do these things the benefit is [6390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6390.36s)

not worth the risk and uh instead let's do these things for zoonotic pandemic you know spillover prevention and these things regarding information sharing and lab security and whatever and then there's like legal work to do right like legal work to get a couple of the main countries to do and then maybe you know [6414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6414.36s)

the who to do something the g20 to do something that is adequate that's a triage type thing that's saying okay here's a risk and we don't need to get everybody to buy into something we basically need to show that the um the risk opportunity space needs something different done so there's some [6435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6435.6s)

scientific work but it's this is a convening of a not large number of people and obviously you know this is a topic we have both actively worked on along with a number of other people but it's this is just one that kind of makes sense um and then there's legislation legislative work within existing [6453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6453.9s)

legislative apparatus to be able to get that stuff done we could say a very similar thing of like uh protecting the ensuring that the amazon doesn't uh get to the point of the hydrological pump breaking right a [[planetary boundary]] thing like that um okay well how would we think about how to do triage there effectively i'm just going to talk through some principles of how to think about it because whether you're working in ecuador to begin with it the headwaters of the amazon or brazil because it's the largest total amount of the amazon or any of the other five you know five [6494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6494.639s)

countries touching it or nine countries that have some involvement in the watersheds like you're going to do different things but principles the economic incentive whether it's from mining oil extraction or agriculture is going to be an ongoing pressure because those things that are going to [6515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6515.04s)

not only keep being worth money many of them will keep being worth more money as population demands and etc needs that and those forces can derive governments and they can put out commercials and um you know campaigns that affect the minds and hearts of people and they can do campaign budgets and uh they can pay lobbyists so the if the ngos that are [6542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6542.699s)

fighting it are just fundamentally less capacitated in all those ways it's just not going to work so you've got to think about all right factoring the forces that want to harm the thing we're wanting to protect it what forces are large enough to protect it right just even basic kind of strategic thinking and how could we get the forces that are [6564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6564.42s)

large enough to care and it might not be by appealing to them with some kind of moral or environmental thing it might be some other things so in this case this is an example you and i've talked about if the hydrological pump of the amazon breaks meaning the water that transpires from all the trees it then rains down [6585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6585.179s)

and keeps it as a rainforest but also pumps some of the groundwater into the air that becomes rain in north america that is somewhere between a third and a half of the rainfall in north america every year if the hydrological pump breaks because you've got enough destruction that you stop getting enough rainfall that you stop getting enough plant growth to keep [6604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6604.98s)

pumping the thing right you get this like the [[climate change]] albedo effect there's a positive runaway thing that happens at a certain point and whether we're five years from that or 15 years from that depends upon how fast things are being destroyed and whose model you're looking at but it's not like forever there's a time scale there so [6623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6623.04s)

then you're like all right so a half of the half the rainfall in north america goes away that is absolutely a [[national security]] threat because it's a food security threat of water security threat it threatens the you know food sovereignty and food security and uh so the state department we care about that not because they necessarily care about [6643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6643.739s)

the amazon on its own but because they care about food security now is the state department bigger than amazon watch and rainforest watching whatever ngos are there that could do more to intervene obviously now this is presenting the issue in a to someone else that has the capacity for a reason that they care about even if it is not the reason that people caring [6669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6669.36s)

about the rainforest care about it and then who would they need to see that modeling they would probably want to see that noah and nasa agreed modeling wise yes this much can't be harmed or you'll get that runaway effect to occur so if some people wanting to work on the amazon were like how do i get people at noaa nasa to explain the hydrological pump thing in a way that the state [6693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6693.36s)

department adds it to its list of things to ensure that it ameliorates this is just an example of triage strategic thinking we're not trying to make capitalism as a whole better we're not trying to make the governments of each of those countries better we're simply trying to think strategically more effectively about how to do a thing right that needs to be done a thousand [6714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6714.179s)

things or ten thousand things this is what i would call the triage category and there are a lot of principles so i just gave a principle of whatever the forces arrayed against the thing make sure that you have competent forces similarly arrayed but they don't have to care about it for the same reason they have to care about it for a rationalized [6735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6735.3s)

reason that speaks in the language they understand so who can help translate that that's one principle we could do a whole thing on how to do strategic thinking effectively but triage is largely that it's largely how do we get different players how do we get the economic incentives etc to be able to do things that are needed and of course we [6756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6756.36s)

still have to think through the externalities because there might be issues of having the state department to focus on the amazon or so we have to think through that but that's what i would call the triage category and there is a lot in there and of course there's a lot of people already working on frontline approaches for the amazon they're just not thinking about [6774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6774.239s)

what is the total threat landscape to the amazon what are the tipping points to not hit and what is a strategically adequate focus and so that's one triage we could we could give a hundred other examples but i think that existing example category do we want to go horizontal or vertical here maybe you could stick with that [6797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6797.34s)

example and look at transition and long term briefly or do you want to break the triage down between culture political economy and tech stack yeah yeah so i'll give a transition example so having something like a state department or and i'm giving one example there's [6821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6821.28s)

obviously groups other than the state department that would also care but in the same way that i said earlier about who who are you politically polarizing against you and how could you get them on your side rather than not how do you get groups that don't currently care to care either that are larger or with a cumulative effect of how they care [6841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6841.679s)

stacks functions enough right that's just straightforward principle of kind of political thinking this is not changing the overall economic incentives in those countries or the mindsets of the people or anything so it's not a systemic effect this way called triage so transitional would be working with those in the [6861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6861.54s)

institutions of those countries right they're department of the interior or its equivalent their academy their academies and universities that are focused on these things their government security bodies their financial bodies how could we make those smarter how to make the logics of them better so they do a better job with these types of things so [6883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6883.56s)

an example there could be something like uh i learned this kind of thinking from a guy named nelson del rio prosperity of the commons really smart lawyer who uh did a lot of the work on making the public-private partnership and then just legal structure and then saw how that got weaponized in a different structure but let's say let's say that we focused on ecuador be because it's the headwaters of the amazon so even though it's not the most total square meters it's the most critical square meters uh because you messed the headwaters up obviously the entire basin gets messed up and we see that [6925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6925.32s)

and i might have some of my stats wrong because i looked at this a couple years ago but so i'm just using this as a random example but ecuador owed a lot of money to both the world bank and uh chinese bank and some of that debt is collateralized with resource access and was not in a position to be able to pay that debt off well so what happens right does that threaten uh resource [6951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6951.9s)

acquisition near the headquarter the amazon that could mess up the amazon basin if you start thinking about the relationship between the state department that might want to prevent the hydrological pump breaking for food security and the world bank obviously uh the u.s and the world bank are very [6970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6970.86s)

related institutions right and so could the state department get the world bank to change its debt structure debt forgiveness or things like that yeah totally could could the world bank work with the chinese bank to get it to do it as well based on if it was motivated enough international financial agreements yeah [6990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=6990.42s)

i probably could do that as well if somebody could negotiate how to set that whole thing up of the state department support with the forgiveness of the debt which is like 32 billion dollars like a lot of debt and then that would mean a lot to the government of ecuador and it might not be know how to do that on their own now the country needs an economic [7013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7013.699s)

development plan that doesn't involve running its rainforest assets so they probably need to in education process to do a lot more skilled labor and they probably need tech so let's say we somebody put together an economic development plan that involved bringing more tech jobs and tech capacity to the area and more education for more skilled labor so [7035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7035.36s)

that you could still have economic development without as much environmental exploitation and let's say that to the degree there were some resources that needed to be extracted or exploited we helped make have that country develop its own national capability to do its minor extraction that employed people there as opposed to say a chinese contractor that [7055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7055.4s)

was employing chinese people to do it or and that because of that had much stricter environmental regulation did a better version of it and private and held more of the wealth for ecuador rather than more of it going to a multinational but they can't do that because they don't have that capacity on their own economically or whatever but they could [7074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7074.06s)

be supported to so again i'm saying if there is some group that is really caring about the amazon they want to do a transitional thing could someone say all right here's a 10 20 30 year economic development plan that involves some of those resources being extracted in a viable way that doesn't ruin the environment and provide jobs whatever but also provides a lot of [7092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7092.48s)

economic development not on the resource extraction category and get you both a lot less environmental harm per extraction and more of the money from that extraction and we will help set that up and open the capital markets help negotiate the capital markets being able to fund this thing and you'll bond back it so we can make sure that the capital markets can come into it will [7114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7114.08s)

also help negotiate the release of your debt but here's the deal we're going to offer this deal to you as a package that includes excluding the mining rights of all these other companies and the logging and the in the ranching and like that so you either get this deal in whole or not but you can't take this other thing that's happening on this why [7133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7133.699s)

this is unique is because most people who focus on for benefit capitalism they're like okay well i can make money doing this good thing but it doesn't bind other people from doing the bad thing if i want to bind other people from doing the bad thing either have to create law that doesn't do it like you know make it illegal or contract law [7154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7154.52s)

where those who would say allow the person allow the other kind uh you know multinational to come in and do the thing are not going to because there's an exclusive contract and so if i think about how to use markets more effectively i don't just want to incentivize some positive thing i also want to bind the negative thing from not happening right so we all know [7178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7178.28s)

that politically people bundle  __  in ways that are really messed up there's some clean water act that everybody's going to want with some like privatized prison or  __  up thing that's attached to it in the same thing you're like how why did those things get together they don't belong together but can that same tool be utilized for positive purposes where you [7198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7198.8s)

provide an actual healthy economic development plan and they uh protection plan for that country you factor which choice makers are going to have to make the choice and what do they need in terms of public opinion and whatever to be able to do the thing and put something together if it's a deal they will take that also is exclusive to the other thing now this is helping their [7219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7219.44s)

entire institutional complex to be better structured right less [[perverse incentive]] in the whole thing long-term development of new economic areas this would be an example of a transitional strategy where you're helping the overall set of institutions get healthier longer term and again i gave an example here but we could we could give an example and a [7241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7241.46s)

coral reef or in the congo or in you know whatever gazillion things where you're thinking about principles like that how what things would we want to bundle together to ensure that they all happen together which ones would we want to force exclusion of who would have to make which choices what are the incentives that they need things like that [7258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7258.86s)

and what about long-term long-term is things like you don't have global capitalism uh in the global financial system in the same way anymore you don't have you like long term is things like real cost valuation on everything so that the actual market cost of a thing included [7286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7286.58s)

the cost to make all of the raw ingredients renewably and the environmental cost long term in which case you just don't have [[perverse incentive]] environmentally as a whole long term means education system where everyone is educated in this type of way so that you actually have culture where people are oriented about what is actual value [7309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7309.04s)

fundamentally differently right so um long term is food systems and manufacturing systems and whatever that are closed loops that don't need to keep exploiting new virgin areas forever and do these things happen sequentially triage transition long term or do you start all three of them now on parallel tracks not only do they have to have all three [7337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7337.34s)

start now they have to be in conversation and in turn from each other because the what will long-term viable be if the people who are doing the transition aren't thinking about it they might be transitioning more sideways than forward right like they might be missing critical insights about what will long-term sufficiency look like and if the people who are thinking about long-term solutions aren't paying attention to the details of the reality on the ground they might not have enough detail to think about it rightly they're thinking about to abstractly so those are horizons of focus but that doesn't mean sequential and they do need to be in dialogue okay and then vertically how do we think [7375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7375.619s)

about culture political economy and tech stack infrastructure on the bottom with respect to what you were just saying when you think about triage it's hard to separate them because you're looking at an eminent issue happening in which they're all kind of happening together right and so your triage solution might have to might have to affect cultural things because the mindsets of the [7402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7402.679s)

populist matter um it might not like regulation of synthetic bio probably does not need everybody to agree it probably needs a very small number of people to agree um so how important culture is or not depends most people don't really have a say and do we go to nuclear war or not over a certain thing what is the point [7424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7424.04s)

of nuclear escalation is so um and yet those who would do it still have to pay attention to political will to some degree um so i would say that you want to use frameworks like this to think about am i factoring what the cultural elements are what the political economy elements with the tech elements are but your triage [7446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7446.659s)

solutions are going to in are going to be focused on just immediate efficacy and they'll all three be very connected when you're thinking longer term transition i can think about culture in terms of like there are versions of all the religions that are more compatible with each other and less compatible right there are there are versions that [7471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7471.199s)

are more kind of um non-violent forgiveness oriented universalists and other ones that are more fundamentalist religious oriented being able to support the more compatible versions of the religions flourishing more than the other ones is kind of a culture play long term that i don't have to think about the political economy and the tech to think about that though they are very very connected right if if i think about it how do i support the proliferation of a particular version well if i can help it develop more tech and more financial capacities it becomes a lot easier for that version to proliferate if it also has more economic power behind it right [7514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7514.82s)

um so i think we did a good job of giving a couple examples of triage on transition i'd like to give a different example so like transition and then the difference between transition and long term let's say we're taking the united states government federal government [7539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7539.84s)

long-term the underlying structure of representative democracy is just insufficient the the u.s structure made in 1776 when the world was radically more simple um is there is no way to retrofit it adequately so specifically things like markets just get an advanced new tech [7567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7567.92s)

and only after it has caused health or environmental problems long enough for long-term studies to be done and watchdog groups to lobby enough and fight against the vested interest lobbying does regulation happen post facto and so you know 80 years after leaded gasoline was causing problems you finally out [7589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7589.76s)

outlawed or cigarettes or ddt you don't get to keep having a post-factor regulatory system with problems that cause harm at exponentially faster scale and more speed and live so a new situation where when new tech emerges you actually have to go through this externality process that we talked about to get regulatory okay for it to move forward and of [7613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7613.58s)

course i'm aware that it's very hard to concentrate that much power and not have it become corrupt and dystopic so of course there have to be checks and balances on that power and transparencies and they're really hard issues in there we can get into that but there is a need to be able to ensure the not terrible risk of things that [7632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7632.5s)

have exponentially bigger and faster impacts ahead of time that's an example of a fundamental change in our existing system of government um obviously if we were going to rebuild a new [[open society]] civilizational architecture from scratch today we would do it differently than the retrofits of how we did it starting in you know the early [7658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7658.52s)

industrial era um so there are a lot of long-term shifts where we think about how do we implement all of the information technology tools to factor all of the things and um i i could get it actually we should do one where we talk about the combinations of [[liquid democracy]] and qualified democracy and addressing heroes and possibilities here i mean all the things i want the future of a governance stack could look like but that's i'll pass on that for a minute and just come back to transition because that was the example i wanted to do uh you said we should do one what what do you mean one one podcast or one i mean it would be worth talking about that at some point if that [7698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7698.9s)

was if that was something people had questions on like what does yeah what what does a governance system that is adequate to the complexity of the issues actually look like but let me go ahead and give an example of transition that is not yet adequate but a lot better than we currently have people like larry lessig who you know [7718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7718.46s)

constitutional lawyers and focused on these issues have identified a handful of issues that they see as being able to and i don't mean to misquote him i spoke with them recently about this and i think this is roughly right he's focused on that if we can get the primaries to not be partisan because one of the problems [7740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7740.54s)

of the uh primaries being partisan is you get this heavy focus on appeal to your in-group and don't pay any attention to how the outgrowth the other side is going to focus and you get much more extreme polarizing things similarly if you can get ranked choice voting rather than just the single vote then if you highly polarize the other side you'll do much less well than if you [7762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7762.98s)

appeal to your support base but also appeal or don't disappeal to the other side so you'll decrease the incentive for polarization with ring choice voting if you can fix gerrymandering which is a such a just obviously corrupt nonsense thing and it's such a straightforward thing to be able to fix a district start to make sense and if you can fix campaign finance [7784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7784.76s)

then the ins the perversion of the system to focus on party over uh country to continuously polarize which will make most of the energy turn into waste heat fighting each other and then four years do something and four years undo it like the current system with its existing logics would just be so much smarter if you did a handful of things like that now obviously the only people who [7811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7811.699s)

wouldn't want that are the people that benefit from the corruption of the system which might be things like the people who run the political parties and stuff so there is some work to do but that is that's not triage right that's not going to solve a particular [[biosecurity]] risk it's not going to solve a nuclear it's not going to solve the environmental boundary but it's going to [7828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7828.56s)

make something called the us federal government smarter and less stupid and less corrupt so all the things that it does will be better but it's going to do it in a way that works within its own existing system logics so that's what i would call a transitional solution whereas how do we rebuild a digital democracy for from scratch that is a totally different kind of structure as a [7849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7849.26s)

long-term solution so that's an example of thinking about the distinction between triage which is not systemic transition which is systemic but a change to existing systems and then the build of fundamentally new systems i'm agreeing with everything you're saying but it's totally different than what i expected this conversation would [7871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7871.34s)

be about i thought we would have discrete examples in the culture political economy tech energy infrastructure stack and as you're talking it almost seems like the things that i would put in these nine boxes well to me it's all about triage now and it's almost like preparing the economy for the financial [7898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7898.0s)

energy uh rubber band snapback my work on on that it almost like enables you to work on all these other things like i think that is going to change the landscape of all these other examples that you were giving and and that has a very specific but i i just recognize that there's lots of these [[existential risk|existential risks]] that may or may not happen certainly climate is happening and is going to happen regardless of what we do our attempts now are to minimize it and to cope with it uh as a species and culture but i i think we are years or a decade away from a recalibration of the musical chairs of financial claims relative to the biophysical claims so i thought we might [7959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7959.599s)

talk about oh well how does ai fit into that or how does [[blockchain]] fit into that and my answer to that is they would help uh extend the metabolism for a while longer at best but they're not they're not solutions they're they're short-term fixes so what is the triage on how effectively eight billion people are going to have to deal with a smaller pie for the first time in 150 years and [7987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=7987.86s)

that is a very large conversation but i i do like the conceptual way in in which you're painting this but i i might have more discrete uh suggestions on on each of these boxes no let me say that a different way on the triage i would on the transition in longer term i think we're largely in agreement at least on the things you've said so far yeah i mean i think with transition or [8016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8016.06s)

triage i gave an example of [[biosecurity]] and an example of something like the hydrological pump of the amazon we didn't get to triage examples on um right there's triage on every single issue yeah now i think we could do that i think we could say let's pick 10 of the most pressing issues and give more examples there so really what we [8039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8039.579s)

did so far was just lay out a framework to think about these things not anything like completion of that and we couldn't complete it but we could do quite a lot more so maybe if there was a follow-up we should have a hundred people at a three-day meeting talking about those all those boxes and we will um and if for this podcast as a [8062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8062.38s)

follow-up maybe it would be a combo of uh a handful of areas in which you're thinking about triage solutions and you share the things you're thinking about and we dialogue on them with questions that the audience has that might be a really fun was really presenting frameworks to think about what do how do you approach [8085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8085.36s)

the [[metacrisis]] more than something like a laundry list of the things to do i just feel this i i emotionally feel the intensity of this bend versus break moment and i've come to that because of my awareness of the connection between energy and finance but it sure seems that geopolitically we also have a uh are approaching a bend versus break moment in many other ways so [8111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8111.76s)

um i'm getting uh urgent texts that i have to go and deal with animals because it's going to be very cold tonight so how would you like to wrap this up my friend i think um it makes plenty of sense for us to do a follow-up if there are questions and uh i'm sure there will be questions [8137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8137.02s)

and if there's more examples of solutions we'd like to get into um and very likely ongoing conversations will keep being fun and valuable but i do feel like there's a certain arc of completion that we got to of problem framing framing up how to be with that and then talking through how to think about how to approach [8161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8161.56s)

how to work with it which is not a solution it's not a list of solutions it's a it's a way of thinking about and relating to the approach and uh i feel really good about that we got to have this whole dialogue and i am very interested to hear the questions that people have and if we have follow-ups soon that'll be great thank you next week is thanksgiving and [8187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8187.54s)

i'm grateful for a lot of things i'm grateful that our paths crossed and that we continue to uh be colleagues and share notes and ideas and connections because what else should we be doing with our time on this planet is swinging for the fences on um the human predicament you call it the medic crisis and we need orders of magnitude more people having these conversations in [8217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8217.179s)

their communities in their networks around the world uh so i deeply value your your intellect and wisdom and your your generous spirit of of sharing your time with others on this so thank you so much is uh a thing that some people could do if they've helped called if people have listened to all five of these and they felt it was meaningful and they decided [8240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8240.28s)

they wanted in there uh community to host a watching series and then you know dial like create a support group of how do we help each other in our own development in this that'd be a cool thing and uh what else should we do we should go tend to the animals when it's cold outside yeah so um i'm gonna i'm gonna do that you know between the time that this is recorded and it's aired um there will be a podcast with thomas bjorkman who talks about inner development and uh having different perspectives is really really good and i do think somewhere out there we need to have this ability to temporarily suppress your own [8284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8284.92s)

identity to be part of a larger conversation take other perspectives think systemically the way that you talked about uh in this podcast in a formal or semi-formal education system that you're experiencing this learning with other humans who then form bonds and there's this social network that that spills throughout the world and i i don't know how to formalize that [8311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8311.58s)

but our education system is sorely lacking right now for the future that we're facing so if you're going to set up some sort of a academy or what whatever uh gaia speed to you on that my friend let me know if i can help okay you you are already uh employed as a professor once it gets there i just haven't told you yet okay um thank you this concludes our bend [8341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kep8Fi_rUUI&t=8341.139s)
