email to download my free two-part video training series and learn the ultimate secrets to happiness and fulfillment let's get started with soul talk welcome back folks welcome to another episode of the soul talk podcast today's episode is going to be i think another special one i'm actually very curious and excited to interview my guest today at the opportunity to hear him speak at a very special conference an association of transformational leaders uh last year and i think he really shook the audience those uh who were in attendance and brought some profound perspective and insights that were really really profound deep and uh challenging in terms of uh the typical way we we view life and see things and so i think uh today's will be very interesting so get your notepads ready he's a co-founder at the neuro hacker collective director of research and development which focused on developing processes [103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=103.84s)

technologies for advancing medicine human optimization uh he has a blog on redis designing civilization at civilization emerging i mean when i heard him speak i consider him a philosopher so welcome to the conversation today uh my friend daniel schmuckenberger daniel welcome thank you my friend i am happy to be [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=128.16s)

here i'm looking forward to this conversation great to have you on and so uh look i'm curious i have a bunch of questions for you but i am curious especially for those that may you know not know your work um or your blog or you know what you've been sharing in terms of interviews you know i saw you speak and it was very [147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=147.68s)

very deep you shared a lot of uh i think at least for me profound insights what what exactly this might sound simple or strange but what daniel what exactly do you do i mean like are you are you are you a philosopher i mean for me you were philosophizing you know you what would you call yourself you know what do you do what [170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=170.64s)

you call yourself what you know what i'm saying well what's the deal yeah um i don't know that i'd really be all that interested in calling myself anything um what do i what do i do i can talk about what i'm interested in and things that i'm that i put energy [194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=194.56s)

towards and study and work with you mentioned a little bit with regard to medicine and biotechnology i it's a area that i'm uh fascinated by and love and so there's some attention in that space that was actually kind of unintentional that was uh because while i was working on other things i had some [220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=220.959s)

uh illness arise that was uh uncurable from traditional methods and so i had to put attention to seeing if i could figure out some way to work with it and it happened to be that some of the scientific background and approach that i have and working on things like ecology and economies and like [[complex system|complex systems]] were applicable to having new insights [243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=243.2s)

in medicine so there's still some work there my primary focus is how do we design a civilization that doesn't cause all of the problems that the types of civilization that we currently have and have had historically environmental and social justice and war and et cetera like what are the underlying bases of all those problems and can we actually change that at the level of the design of a civilization system itself so that looks like you know whether we're looking at [[species extinction]] or [[biodiversity loss]] or trees getting cut down we we can see that underneath all those [285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=285.04s)

issues you have the fact that most trees are worth more cut down than they are alive most animals are worth more killed than they are alive there's a [[perverse incentive]] underneath that war is more profitable than peace sick people are more profitable than healthy people and so you start to say okay well as [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=302.4s)

long as a problem is being incentivized it's not going to stop and so that's like an example of if we if we really want to change the dynamics of the world we have to change how people coordinate and how they make sense of the world and what they're incentivized to do in a deeper way and kind of how i got [324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=324.639s)

into thinking about this was i was as a kid i was working in activism in a bunch of different fields environmental stuff and animal rights and social justice and we made profoundly little progress and i really want to understand why we're humans like those of us in activism it seems so clear that we don't want to kill the elephants for their ivory or clear-cut the amazon and yet so many people in large corporations were continuing to do those things so it's like what is it that is driving all of those how are they interconnected and are there some foundational structures that need addressed [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=367.6s)

and i was you know studying kind of systems theory and complexity and how how things fit together at the same time and so that just led to deeper and deeper inquiry into uh fundamental civilization design stuff so you say kind of what do i do now with it partly looks like looking at near-term risks for the world and seeing [391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=391.36s)

how we can mitigate those and then also looking at how can we actually design new systems of how humanity can make sense of the world and make choices which is like new methods of governance and resource allocation that are structurally different than the types of top-down governments and the [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=410.0s)

types of market systems we've had so far that predispose different patterns of human behavior that don't predispose or environmental destruction and things like that got it so you talked about you know some of the primary problems that we're facing uh or the primary causes of the problems we're facing as a humanity today [433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=433.12s)

uh can you share a bit more about what you see are some of the primary causes in terms of like why we why we are where we are as as humanity as and and while we're facing what we're facing what are some of the primary problems that you could maybe kind of outline a [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=455.199s)

little bit yeah but what are some of the problems kind of on the surface level and what some of the causes are um different connect those um i was giving i was saying when i was young working in activism there was not that much uh success specifically there was one experience where uh [479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=479.599s)

as a kid and were writing letters and raising money and whatever to help a project is working on prevention of poaching for a particular elephant preserve in kenya and because poachers were getting into the protected preserve and still poaching elephants and so there was this huge work that a number of environmental [503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=503.599s)

groups uh animal rights groups worked together to do that involved getting bigger fences around the preserve so the poachers couldn't get in and legislation passed for harsher sentencing for poaching elephants and after like a tremendous amount of work and people having their lives threatened by the [521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=521.279s)

coaching groups and whatever it finally succeeded the fence went up the legislation went through and it actually did stop the poachers from pushing those elephants but it didn't address the poverty of the poachers that had no other way of feeding their kids in some of the poorest areas of the world [536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=536.8s)

and it didn't address the macroeconomy that creates poverty at scale and it didn't address black markets on animal parts and it didn't address all these other interconnected issues that were driving it and so the same groups of poachers moved to start hunting the white rhino and the mountain gorilla both of which were more endangered [554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=554.24s)

and so we didn't solve the problem we moved a problem and we moved it to more sensitive areas where the net effect on the world was actually net worse and because i was engaged with enough different non-profits and being able to see not just what looked like the local success but also the larger failure that was uh that was particularly devastating and [578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=578.32s)

i started looking at all the places where as we were working on solving a problem we were actually just moving problems and oftentimes moving them to being worth problems and it was most of our approach because we were just working on the surface of things without addressing both what's interconnected and what the [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=595.519s)

underlying drivers are and so i started to see quite deeply around what would it take to actually solve these problems and of course that requires both the things we said the context map of how issues are interconnected and so that we actually understand the problem statement well enough the problem there was not [616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=616.88s)

people approaching elements the problem was a macro economy that creates poverty people in poverty mindsets towards animals that are extractive and utilitarian black market dynamics et cetera as well as the poaching of the rhinos of the like there's all these interconnected [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=635.04s)

things and yeah if you try to isolate them and do a reductionist approach what you'll end up doing is usually benefiting something at the extent of the other ones yeah got it so how do you how do you how do you how do you change it some a situation like that what how how do you really [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=655.76s)

go about shifting it but not just at the expense of something else what would be an an approach yeah so to go one step deeper and understanding the nature of the problem because that's one example there's lots of examples i would say the problem that i'm focused on solving more than [681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=681.44s)

anything is that humanity's process of solving problems to date mostly makes horse problems and that we actually need a new problem-solving process and so we we solve problems through legislation and law or through creating a new piece of technology or through sometimes social movements [704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=704.16s)

and all of them usually have in common too narrow an identification of what the problem is not clear enough awareness of the layers of causation and so you end up getting this displacing effect but in general if i'm going to solve a problem my solution has to be bigger in terms of [724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=724.32s)

scale or speed or whatever then the problem was to overtake it and if it's bigger and it externalizes harm somewhere else that i wasn't paying attention to that adjacent problem down the road will end up being bigger so like in technology i'll give you an example let's say now this will sound maybe a little bit grim [748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=748.32s)

i don't think it is but i do think it's important to understand as part of the context because so i would say that if we look at humans ability to make tools so technology development is obviously key to how we go about solving problems and a lot of people today would say the answer to most of the problems in the world is we're going to make better tech better solar cells to displace the fossil fuels and better stem cell meats to displace the [[factory farm|factory farms]] and whatever right and i don't think those things are worthless they're a part of the answer but usually the way they're approached not adequate [784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=784.48s)

if we think about any tech that humans have ever created let's go all the way back to like stone tools and in the wheel and we say has that increased human capacity totally has it made life better in some super meaningful ways totally has it also allowed us to do some really messed up stuff yeah totally and [804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=804.48s)

so when you say how many things have we damaged in the world having the wheel that had we not had the wheel we couldn't have damaged and it's like amazing right because if you if you think about a world where we didn't have that level of transportation technology we couldn't actually [821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=821.6s)

risk the the whole biosphere we couldn't wage war at scale and then you go forward and you say okay well the internal combustion engine and the development of the car was pretty awesome for increasing mobility and transportation we were really stoked on that and it was solving problems like mobility problems actually one of the problems it was [841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=841.04s)

really solving was the problem of the fact that forcing carriages in cities like london were just leaving so much horse that the cities were having a hard time functioning and being buried in horseshit and so we wanted an internal combustion engine to solve the horseshit problem and so then we get [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=856.32s)

an internal combustion engine and you look at you know fast forward 100 years and [[climate change]] and particulate pollution in the atmosphere and oil spills and offshore oil drilling with spills and wars over oil and destabilization politically of the whole middle east like the biggest issues you can [875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=875.68s)

imagine are the results of that thing having succeeded but it not being a comprehensive look at what needs to happen and so in general what we do is take a very complex picture that's very interconnected ecosystems are very connected human [[social system|social systems]] are very connected human bodies are connected [896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=896.0s)

same was like if we see that someone's cholesterol is high so we give them a statin to lower it but we don't ask why it was time what are all the connected things we'll lower the cholesterol but cause toxicity to other systems in the process without actually making a healthier system and so the the process has to move from a narrow [916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=916.639s)

definition of the problem where the solution that we create to solve that interacts with a lot of other things that we aren't factoring and then externalizes harm to those things to a process of understanding how the thing that we're looking at is contextualized in a much more whole landscape and then being able to take [937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=937.04s)

all of the things that it's connected with and all the underlying layers of causative effect and factor those into the design of an adequate solution which basically means we need much deeper [[sensemaking]] into what's actually going on to inform the design solutions so that they're actually good design solutions [958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=958.24s)

and don't just take the can down the road and externalize and specifically when we have the level of technological power we have today we can't keep solving problems in ways that make bigger problems because the problems are already catastrophic and so we actually have to fix this so i really do see us at the brink of a [978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=978.48s)

necessary epoch shift into a phase that is different than anything in human history so far yeah we were in a very uh pivotal time and so as a side note i i have a question about questions i'm curious when you let's say look at a problem because you know problems yeah part of life you could say everyone [1006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1006.32s)

alive as human beings in their personal lives relationship financial health facing problems the world facing problems uh as a humanity we're facing problems i'm curious when you look at a problem are there any uh key questions that you tend to ask [1025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1025.76s)

yourself when looking at a problem that helps you see a problem differently so that you can get a different viewpoint or a higher perspective see the whole more clearly and so there any questions you you typically ask yourself or is it just new in every moment can you share a bit about that yeah this [1053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1053.52s)

is this is actually a question i really like because the emphasis here is that in order to address problems better we need to ask better questions and so that we get fuller because the questions are a lead into having fuller [[sensemaking]] to inform the right kind of choices in the right kind of design and [1073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1073.84s)

so more than what is one specific kind of question is the kind of doubling down on question asking in general um and having a process where before we say okay here's the problem we roll up our sleeves and we have this kind of action-oriented bias that says all right right away what's the first solution we can come up with [1094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1094.96s)

i want to say do we actually understand the problem well do we understand the history of how it evolved to be this way do we understand all of the connected factors do we understand all of the partial causal factors that might be multifactorial do we do we actually understand it well enough to know what the problem statement is to know what a good [1111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1111.84s)

solution would be where the solution is not just good from the point of view of the obvious thing but the things that would be future externalities can we actually pay more attention to that up front so i want to process where the design team all the people involved and let's say it was a a civics group who was focused on [1129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1129.76s)

whatever it was like a transportation issue in their area we start by collectively going through processes of uh asking all the questions that we would need to address in order to have the information necessary to know how to do the design before we start getting into the design and so oftentimes the questions you know let's say i'm looking at a situation where we're contemplating building a bridge somewhere and there's some obvious pros in terms of lowering trends of time which would help economies and like that but there's some cons that the particular proposal where the bridge might go would damage [1167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1167.28s)

local ecosystems and i want to ask a lot of questions of like what are the reasons that we really want to bridge let's understand those because it might be that we can just make the local economies on both sides better and necessitate the bridge what are the i want to ask the questions around what are the concerns associated with the bridge as an approach what are the [1186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1186.32s)

assumptions underneath this question that the transportation needs to happen at all that the transportation needs a bridge maybe a ferry or a barge could do that it passed there has to be a theory of trade-offs between the economy and the environment maybe there's another place i could put the bridge that doesn't have a sensitive [1201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1201.84s)

ecosystem on the other side and so we want to get into a process of saying what assumptions are built into the way i'm approaching this and i also want to ask what is fundamentally meaningful that is connected to this separate than strategy oftentimes we jump straight to strategy and it's entirely possible that we might [1224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1224.24s)

have two strategies that are mutually exclusive like build the bridge and don't build the bridge and if i assume that build the bridge equals uh make better economy and make better jobs and my kids can't currently get jobs then i am devout for the proposition of make the bridge because it equals automatically my kids [1245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1245.039s)

can actually survive better and if i'm someone else's focused on don't make the bridge equals that this forest stays intact and we don't kill the endangered species in the area then what happens with that kind of polarized position in terms of strategies is we made a shitty proposition right the [1267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1267.84s)

proposition was make the bridge as the solution where we didn't understand the whole context map enough were to solve that problem which was a very partial subset of all the interconnected things where to solve that problem i have to cause another problem so then whoever feels most connected to the problem being solved wants the [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1287.679s)

proposition whoever feels most connected to what would be harmed doesn't want the proposition and just by the process of creating a proposition that way and having people vote on it you polarize the population and now people spend most of their time fighting each other rather than figuring out which solutions together and so before i even create a [1305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1305.919s)

proposition that might be based on like dumb polarization i want to say what matters to everyone separate from the strategy so okay you actually don't care if there's a bridge or not you care that there's good economic opportunities for your kids and the other person you don't actually care [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1324.32s)

there's not a bridge you care that the uh ecosystems are protected if we there isn't actually anything that makes those two things mutually exclusive necessarily and being able to hold them both as design constraints might lead to a different solution that we then we wouldn't have thought of at all and so this is where we want to say okay [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1344.72s)

so what is actually meaningful separate from the strategy that we think is going to fulfill it so that we can hold all the meaningful things to possibly enter into a design process um it doesn't have to be based on unnecessary theory of tradeoffs which will force polarization of populations and harm of some things for the benefit of others [1367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1367.12s)

so these types of questions what assumptions are underneath how i'm thinking about that what how do i separate what is meaningful and what are all the things that are meaningful from the possible strategies and in order to address the questions i'm thinking about what other questions would i have to address that are underneath [1385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1385.52s)

these are connected to these so that i get this deeper context map of related topics and then answering those questions in forms that i would need to know to even approach the design of a solution properly there's this saying in that in engineering saying that charles kettering that problem fully [1405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1405.36s)

understood is half solved but the corollary is that a problem not fully understood is unsolvable and so i want to start with do we actually understand not just what looks like the problem but what is actually the problem set do we really understand it well enough that we even know what a good [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1426.88s)

solution would be because if we go to solution creation before we even know what we're looking for as a good solution and a good solution comprehensively enough that it's not a bad solution in the future or a bad solution to somebody i else that do we even understand the nature of the problem i think many of many times we're so busy [1447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1447.84s)

to try and fix something without even understanding the the underlying nature of a problem itself and so i mean this is really great stuff uh i'm i'm curious now as you're sharing um you know that if our ability to let's say understand the problem um it's partly perhaps you know how you see a problem uh is going to be let's say different than i see a problem different than you know joe or susie or bill you know anyone else sees the problem and so would it be fair to our ability to understand the problem may be determined by our level of consciousness and if so at you know different level of if we're expanded in this level of [1504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1504.32s)

consciousness we're able to perceive a problem differently at that level of consciousness and how does one how does someone listening in a person who's just having listening to this conversation with us how does one get to the level of uh wisdom um [1529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1529.52s)

expanded perception uh yeah enlightenment you know as in just more expansion in their ability to perceive a problem to understand the nature of a problem so that they can even uh create a more uh an effective proposition to begin with yeah are there any things that are there anything that you've also done [1558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1558.159s)

in your own practice life that have given you more ability to see a problem and even understand the problem differently because i think we're so stuck in on conditioning that we don't even understand the nature of problems so anyway that's my question so let's let's take the way the fact that people might understand a problem [1579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1579.44s)

differently and based on kind of their understanding and their conditioning and let's separate it into some people might understand a problem more completely like their understanding includes someone else's understanding with more stuff so includes and transcends it versus people have different backgrounds [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1598.4s)

neither one includes or transcends the other they just have different things they're focused on both are true so let's say we go back to that someone might look at the situation there and if they were to describe the problem they see they would they would see a problem that there wasn't enough protection of the [1614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1614.159s)

preserve to actually protect the elephants and based on what they were tuned into of watching the elephant herd you know like maybe one of the keepers on the ground would see that problem maybe someone else would look and based on being tuned into something else they would say i see a poverty problem because those poachers actually don't [1632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1632.88s)

want votes they would much rather do something else they grew up in a local tribe that was animistic and talks about the spirit of the elephant they just they either kill that elephant or they watch their child starving and so because they're looking somewhere else they're tuned into a different problem someone else says actually it's not the issue of the poverty in that little area it's the issue of the structure of macroeconomics where at large that makes a power law distribution in wealth that makes poverty areas all around the world how do we actually change macroeconomics someone else says well it actually has to do with a world view that is based on commoditizing other species in life and not seeing them as having intrinsic value and so you can see that based on what people are paying attention to they would see they would all see parts of it right and it doesn't necessarily mean that any of them are at a higher level of consciousness [1685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1685.679s)

they're just tuned in to different things that are all interconnected and so the first thing is you'll notice that a technologist looking at it or a mother looking at it or an ecologist looking at it are going to look through the lens of what they are kind of trained to look for and they'll see different things so this is where in my own life if i'm going to make a choice by myself i have to make sense of the problem or the what is desired by myself but if there's a bigger thing where we're going to collectively make a choice together then we have to also collectively sense make and the collective [[sensemaking]] is what is the stuff that you're seeing and what is the stuff that i'm saying what and can we actually synthesize all this to a much bigger picture at the level of the collective than any of us had as individuals and so this is not just how do i evolve my consciousness to hold more this is how do i relate with other people to be able to have the the group have a higher order intelligence than any of the people on their own do now i'll bridge those and say something that people can do as individuals to hold more of the whole is to actively seek to look at the situation through the lens of other people [1764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1764.64s)

actively seek to look at the situation through the lens of another okay yeah so you know you actually asked how does someone uh hold greater perception so if we think about perception or perspective perspective on anything that inherently means i'm not seeing the [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1786.88s)

whole thing i'm seeing it through from a particular direction through a particular lens from a particular advantage so every act of perception of reality is inherently reducing the total information of reality right if i'm looking at a building from the west side i'm not seeing the inside and the south side and the aerial view and so my [1806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1806.96s)

perception is true but it's partial and if i believe it to be complete then i'm just wrong and so i have to get that if i'm looking at a building there is no perspective that gives me the whole thing i have to actually take lots of perspectives and then be able to integrate them in a way that i [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1829.44s)

can't compress into a single perspective and so we could easily fight you standing on the east side of the building me standing on the west side and saying it looks like this no it looks like this or we could say okay these there is some truth in each of these there's limitation and then the actual reality can't be reduced to [1846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1846.08s)

a picture because a 3d reality doesn't fit into 2d without limitation or distortion and so in a similar way the first thing that i would want to do if i was trying to solve a any kind of problem that affected number of people would be to ask other people how they see the problem [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1871.76s)

and rather than ask do i agree or disagree i would try and see it through their eyes and see both see what they see and see why they see it that way and see what things they see that i wasn't seeing or i wasn't waiting enough and so that i can factor more perceptions you asked if there was a practice that i do there was [1892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1892.96s)

when i was a teenager this practice really hit me and i um i was actually i was with a friend who happened to be a hairdresser and this thing went off and we were sitting watching people walk by and she commented like four or five times on the way people's haircut framed up [1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1913.279s)

their face and that that they had a really beautiful jawline that their haircut was wrong to accentuate it or their haircut was right or the color brought up their eyes or and i realized that i had never noticed what anyone's hair looked like like i'd never actually paid attention and i'd never paid attention to the way [1931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1931.919s)

that it accentuated the structures of their face and she's paying so much attention to it i'm like she actually lives in a universe i've never even been to um in the totality of information available she's tuned into stuff i'm not tuned into and so i'm missing so much stuff and so i asked her to start explaining to me what she saw in [1952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1952.0s)

everyone's face and i tried to take on seeing the world the way that she did and in order to do that i had to stop noticing all the things that i would notice because there wasn't enough conscious bandwidth and i'm like wow there's a whole nother universe here and i'm i was missing information and so then i went and said what are all the [1968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1968.559s)

perspectives that i'm missing and i went and talked to a friend who is a mechanical engineer and i asked him will you just share your thoughts out loud with me as we walk around the world and we walked around and he talked about the nature of the compressional stress and shearing stress on on the [1988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=1988.0s)

lamp poles as we were walking in how he would design them differently and the way that the screws were threaded and how he would do different threading of the screws and the way that the street was banged for the flow of water and again like what he was tuned into is a universe i had mostly never paid attention to and then i walked with the astronomer [2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2004.799s)

friend and everything they looked at they were thinking about how these atoms were formed in supernovas and how those atoms got here and the whole process so i took on the practice of being other people and trying to see the world through their eyes experience it through their experience as completely as i could [2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2024.159s)

yes and then be able to step out then be able to take many different people's perspective on the same situation one at a time and then see what greater insight could i get by being able to synthesize those in myself love it i love it it kind of opens up i think many dimensions of perspective and what i'm also hearing is is opens it has the possibility to open up uh compassion uh as you are able to really step into those perspectives um i think it's very about what you're saying actually uh seeing the situation from the lens of another um i'm curious what about let's say uh [2073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2073.599s)

when someone's perspective because i you know it i think it is difficult for people to sometimes do that especially when the other perspective can seem or feel so polarizing let's say when someone's perspective is uh you know uh yeah white people are bad black people are a a less than or you [2097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2097.52s)

know uh let's say uh anti-abortion pro-choice when some of the perspectives are aren't just oh wow someone's here but fund them at least seeming fundamental to you know one's existence or value as as a being as a human being what what what about when to take on someone's perspective you know there's so much charge and look at our politics in america today so when there's such a charge and maybe when someone's perspective seems so fundamentally different wrong you know uh against one's i don't know belief system that it could be threatening to one's life even how how how how to do it in that situation i think that's what that's what i'm really trying to to understand would love your perspective on that you know because yeah i could see it but well i don't want to believe that you know gay people are evil [2164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2164.64s)

or bad or i i i how would i how would i enter that perspective okay so this is obviously um super deep and essential to uh everything in the world and also very sensitive so unpack this in a couple of steps please so when you ask how can how can we where there is a lot of charge take the [2192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2192.96s)

perspective of the other i think to some degree the answer is we can't which means to the degree that i am so fused with the way that i see things that i can't actually take the way that i see things off because i'm getting triggered into emotional reaction then i actually won't be able to and so this there's actually a very interesting kind of spiritual insight in this process of let's say i take on the perspective of the hairdresser or the mechanical engineer or the astronomer or the clans member or the jihadist or the whatever right so what part of me is able to take on seeing the world through [2236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2236.64s)

their perspective because it's not my perspective right my perspective is kind of synonymous with my ego my personality my my way of seeing the world that i've identified with a name and a sense of self and if i'm really going to see the world through someone else's perspective i actually have to let like [2256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2256.0s)

if i'm if i'm going to really see the world through your perspective i can't be kind of half-assing it through your perspective and assessing whether i agree with it or not at the same time so then i say well what elements of me can see the world through your perspective i'm like well the consciousness that is witnessing the [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2272.4s)

stream of thoughts that i call daniel can also witness the stream of thoughts and perceptions as i understand them that we call koot but daniel can't do that because it's already like his consciousness is already full his bedstream's already cold so to really seek to take the [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2289.92s)

perspective of someone else requires letting my perspective go and saying what i'm what is taking that perspective is actually consciousness not ego so there is a forced move from identity to something deeper than identity in the process of looking through the lens of someone else so it's actually like from a spiritual perspective it's one of the most potent [2314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2314.96s)

spiritual exercises i know because to really take on being someone else you are really experiencing consciousness not filtered through your own identity and so that's one thing so the degree to which my identity is so traumatized that my and that i have so little training and having my consciousness [2337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2337.04s)

be able to witness it and real and not be fully fused with it i won't be able to take other people's perspectives so the answer is i want to understand that i could have grown up differently and have different beliefs and have different likes and have different habits and there would still be a consciousness witnessing it so this there's there is something [2355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2355.76s)

deeper to what i am than those perspectives that are polarized with someone else's perspective in fact had i grown up where they grew up in exactly their life experience they'd probably believe about the same thing and now i can get that cognitively i might also have to do some trauma healing [2376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2376.32s)

to be able to do this but yeah but for instance let's say that let's say i'm i want to think about a clan number or any kind of view that as uh our group is the supreme one or the only one with rights to such and such right well i'm not going to say that that view is a viable view of the world but i will say say i want to understand how little babies grew up to be adults believe that and why that makes sense to them and why it feels true because i can't work with them if i don't understand that and if i can't work with them then i'm like i can feel righteous about and still be ineffective [2424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2424.24s)

i can be pretty righteously sure that they're wrong and terrible and i'm right and good but i can't kick those groups off the planet so i can try and do warfare with them whether it's [[narrative warfare]] and explaining why they're bad or economic warfare and tariffing them into changing or kinetic warfare and we're [2442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2442.4s)

actually blow them up but they think the same thing about us right they think that they are right and good and we're dumb and bad and they're upping their ability to try and kick us off the planet and at the current level of technological capacity that yup will solve this through warfare isn't possible [2461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2461.839s)

anymore the warfares are too large for the planet to sustain and so we actually have to figure out a different answer so part of it is also helpful realizing we're stuck with each other on this little bitty planet floating through space with no other really good and then so how are we actually going to work it out together [2483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2483.359s)

well yeah how are we things perspective i have no chance of even beginning the conversation saint francis obviously saint prince of assisi talked about seek more to understand than to be understood and he had another poem where he said if you can't imagine yourself a murderer a rapist a torturer under the right settings then you don't know the meaning [2511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2511.599s)

of compassion because you believe yourself to be fundamentally and intrinsically superior to others and you're not and so if i look at child soldiers in darfur or liberia and i see that by the time they're 10 or 11 years old they've all hacked people apart with machetes which is their fault nope [2533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2533.92s)

if they didn't they wouldn't get it to 10 or 11. and we look at the systemic desensitization and conditioning and whatever that happened and there's no part of me that gets to feel superior to them and so i have to say if i was born into that situation i could also be hacking people apart [2552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2552.319s)

with machetes and so then i actually want to imagine being a clan member and saying okay why i've got a group of people who feel actually really disenfranchised they like they're largely dealing with meaningful poverty and they have grown up you know so i imagine [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2578.319s)

a kid right he grows up and he's heard like all he's heard is this kind of racist narrative his whole life so he never had a chance to believe anything else if he didn't believe that he would be rejected and disowned by his family and everyone he's ever known and so that's it like believing that is not only the only thing he's ever been [2597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2597.839s)

exposed to but necessary for inclusion he's had the idea kind of he's been given distorted information that everyone else was given right which is that the the black people will fundamentally commit more crime and more violent crime and etcetera and it might be that some of the stats were true [2621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2621.52s)

but they got taken out of context maybe we see a place where there's a black ghetto where there is more crime because they grew up in environments that are the results of slavery that never actually got properly addressed so because of again understanding the problem in too narrow a way we're like oh there you can start to see where [2638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2638.96s)

white supremacy makes sense in the same way you can see where zionism from the jews are where judaism for the islamic starts to make sense or where then the counter movement in terms of you know black panther or whatever else and but then you see that the fact that they make sense locally doesn't mean that they're viable like they can't find solutions because all they can do is do warfare solutions that will not win they will self-terminate and yet if you look throughout history the answer was always doing exactly that thing and then trying to win the warfare thing and so again if they study history [2674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2674.0s)

they're like we're doing the only thing that anyone's ever done that makes sense this is why i say our process for solving problems is inadequate we never had a process that said our answer is not going to be tribalism with an n group against out groups where we try and win through competitive force that's the only thing that's ever happened and yet [2691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2691.2s)

at a level of power where our economic competition against each other in terms of who can extract resources from the environment fastest will actually make the planet not habitable habitable for anyone and where our warfare technology can't be deployed in a way that wins without destroying the playing field for everyone and [2711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2711.04s)

where our narrative disinfo fighting each other is so much that it has destroyed the landscape of [[sensemaking]] where no one really knows what the is true about anything to be able to make good decisions we actually can't keep doing any kind of in-group out-group competition so if i want to help heal the in-group out group competition i have to [2728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2728.88s)

understand what the world looks like through the lens of each in-group so that i can see what maybe they could what maybe could start to open the possibility set for them what are their unmet means that that's the only strategy they have to meet or maybe if i came up with better strategies to meet those needs new possibilities okay that's that's really cool so so you don't have to agree you don't have to necessarily agree just because you understand let's say an opposing view or an opposing culture doesn't necessarily mean you have to agree with that perspective correct i mean you can have compassion but [2769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2769.76s)

it's not necessarily agreement i want to actually remove the whole concept of agree or disagree at first to begin with because true or disagree is my perspective evaluating theirs the first thing i want to do is actually take on theirs which means i have to let go of mine which is letting go of the part that would agree or disagree [2789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2789.52s)

i want to experience it so if i'm really trying to imagine experiencing being a jihadist freedom fighter in afghanistan i'm not evaluating whether or not i agree as daniel if i'm really experiencing the world through his eyes he's never heard of daniel he doesn't that's not even part of his universe he [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2812.8s)

couldn't give any shits about it but now when i imagine in his environment and i and i don't just imagine it i ask people i go there i seek to understand but even if i just start to imagine i say okay so i've got a situation where these are the countries that have the most natural resources in the world and yet all the people are poor as [2830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2830.64s)

because the government's incorrupt relationships with the west largely the u.s sold all the resources you have the most growth wealth and equality um and the people have no very meaningful prospect of life they drone bombs drone strikes kill mostly civilians like i can start to get like yeah i'd be [2853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2853.52s)

a jihadist because i got nothing to live for i have a thought that dying maybe will secure a spot in heaven for my family members and the like what other possibilities do i have that make any sense now if i really take that on it doesn't mean that i'm like going to go out and support a growth of jihad it means that i'm going to not [2875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2875.76s)

villainize that i'm going to say we actually have to make a different set of paths forward viable for people there and how do we even deal with the level of trauma of that you know that we killed so many people who are mostly civilians who didn't do anything wrong like now if it was your kid that was blown apart by a drone strike in an apartment building while they slept what would you feed against whoever did that like how the do we heal that but if i just say terrorists they're bad we need to be on them more right and so so the first thing is i don't want to even have the part of my [2918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2918.079s)

consciousness on that is agreeing or disagreeing i want to have the part of my consciousness that is just seeking to experience well their perspective has truth in it it is not the truth and so i'm not corroborating their strategy but i am more qualified to come up with good [2935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2935.2s)

strategy now that i know what would be needed to have something possibly work for them um what if what if now i think what you're saying is is hitting me and i'm hoping those listening in it is digesting um what what if what might work for them or what they might think works for them [2957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=2957.76s)

might be unreasonable or detrimental or like what is that with the case well this is where i say let's separate what is meaningful from the strategy to fulfill it and oftentimes people don't know how to do this themselves right so maybe what is meaningful to me i think is that our people have the holy land and that the other people are killed because that's what god wants right yes okay well that's not that's not gonna fly like that is a mutually exclusive strategy and also like now here's a a hard topic but it comes down to what how do we relate to diversity and the [3004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3004.88s)

answer is that like the more diverse an ecosystem is the more resilient and thriving and healthy the ecosystem is so long as all the things in the ecosystem co-evolve so that there is um kind of reciprocal relationships between them we know that if we introduce certain kinds of invasive species that were never part of that [3024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3024.559s)

environment that diversity can actually  the whole thing up and kill the ecosystem right and so we want as much diversity as we can have of perspective and skill and capacity and orientation that we can bring coherence to we want as much diversity as we can actually bring coherence to [3044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3044.96s)

if we have diversity that we cannot bring coherence to then it's just the basis for warfare so any view that says our people are the only people or the chosen people or the right ones or the any view that fundamentally holds that it is mutually exclusive with other ones so it can't find coherence is a kind of diversity that is necessarily [3065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3065.2s)

pathological now that doesn't mean that there still isn't some truth in it but the way that it's being held has to shift now we know there are versions of christians and muslims and jews that hold that way and we also know their ones don't hold that way at all so we know that they're [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3083.2s)

even if someone's holding it that way there's an adjacent world view that holds a lot of what they hold sacred and doesn't hold the up part right yeah yeah and so if if the group holds that what is meaningful to us is that our people are the only people that's not going to fly but what what they really what's actually meaningful like you'll [3100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3100.96s)

notice how many people who have a decent level of life security and a decent level of economic abundance and decent access to education and decent political and religious freedoms become suicide bombers not that many because you got better options and [3122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3122.96s)

so let's say that we have a situation where we've got two fundamentalist groups warring with each other that are both certain that winning is the only way well let's say that we didn't try to convince him of anything we just made a new area where there was kind of a new ground-up society a civilization where if people [3149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3149.52s)

from either of those sides wanted to come join but they wanted to agree to the constitution of this place so they didn't just do the immigrate but stay in their culture and and you know create a ghetto hey we actually like what this other thing represents and we want to come join it so we're going to go through the [3169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3169.359s)

training and education and integration program then there's a welcome but the quality of life is so much higher where it's not about um killing and dying for the cause and you know being in environments is actually the ability of meaningful intimacy and learning and creativity and connection [3187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3187.2s)

a lot of people and especially a lot of young people will start to bail and say you know i i actually have a better option now and the story that offered to me isn't the only story anymore and there is a version where the things that were actually sacred to me can be offered a better way without some of the other things and [3207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3207.04s)

then you know of course you you start to get an attrition and an exodus from the worst structures so the answer is not that you are able to meet everything someone thinks that they need but can we meet the things that people actually need in a way where when that option is [3228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3228.24s)

presented some of the people start shifting and it starts to change the possibility space and then the conditioning space for everyone that's obviously not an instant solution the same is true like if we relate to what might be more connected to a lot of people who are listening if i'm just in a little micro warfare with a family [3248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3248.079s)

member right where yes we know the difference of views and i'm pretty sure that i'm both right and righteous and they're both wrong and being an ass about it um and we both think that there's obviously not that much movement that can occur right my ability to empathize with their perspective like to really feel what [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3271.76s)

they're feeling see the world to their eyes doesn't mean that i'm corroborating it's 100 true it means that i can actually maybe there is some distortion maybe they thought i said something i didn't maybe they are hearing through a lens or some trauma i didn't have but i can get that with that being the case it [3290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3290.319s)

i can totally see why they'd be angry or sad or whatever it is and once i have heard that there's more openness in them generally to also hear something that i've got to share or we can both come to perspectives that are different than what either of us held previously so but i want to offer the empathy [3308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3308.64s)

before i offer the uh the evaluation on what parts of the story weren't true but offering the empathy doesn't mean i'm corroborating all of the story got it yeah some some things to digest there daniel some really uh some powerful things to digest that i think can really uh create a [3330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3330.88s)

shift um folks i hope you're digesting this conversation um i'm loving this conversation with uh the danish raptenberger here we're diving deep you know uh just the sake of time uh a couple more questions i mean i feel like we could rap for at least a good couple of days here uh [3351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3351.599s)

teasing out different things uh you mentioned technology and the advancing technology and the consequences of decisions based on technology uh in our day and age today could be catastrophic so i'm curious um as you look at the world uh yes problems for sure we're facing problems challenges but i'm [3379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3379.92s)

curious what excites you what what uh there's a humanity like what's exciting to you what what what uh what do you see as as the possibility the potential as we as we're going through this challenging time uh what's most exciting well there are things that excite me and concern me at the same time [3413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3413.04s)

and then there's other things that are um more just exciting i'll make the distinction yeah most of the evolutions and technology excite me and concern me so if i look at the development of [[artificial intelligence]] are there things that it could do that would be really life enhancing and [3434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3434.16s)

awesome absolutely we could of course use it to help advance medicine by being able to process protein folding stuff or being able to process huge amounts of information factoring bioinformatics or could we use it for really terrible purposes militarized organized ai better of [3453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3453.52s)

course could we use it for purposes that we think are good and are actually accidentally causing problems for the same reason that all of our other technology always has pretty much certainly so the question is it's just a lot more power now do i think that humans are good stewards of power not so much yet and do i want them do i want humans that are anything like the humans that we have always been that have extincted species and solve their problems through war and done in group out group competition and like that do i want those beings to have exponentially more power nope uh and so when i look at crispr and the ability [3495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3495.359s)

to change the source code of life by editing the genome directly do i think you're wise enough you know how to use that nope not even close now is it exciting what the possibilities could be in terms of deeper insights into cancer and things of course it's exciting but the level of knowledge that allows us to start messing with something is [3515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3515.04s)

orders of magnitude less than is necessary to ensure no externalities in the future and yet the market forces of birth to market have us use it when we know enough to do something but not enough to ensure long-term brightness of strategy so when i look at mostly everything happening in [3533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3533.119s)

in technology and [[exponential tech|exponential technologies]] there are exciting possibilities and applications but i'm more concerned than excited because there's plenty of financial motive to use the thing in destructive ways something that's built for good purposes can be weaponized and there's a lot of actual incentive and basis to weaponize it and [3554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3554.0s)

just even through mistakes we mostly don't uh we don't take considerate enough approaches and so again like if i think about okay look at the roman empire look at the aztec empire look at just humans throughout the whole course of human history do i are those beings the way they [3572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3572.48s)

behave safe vessels for exponential power not yet and so one way of framing up what i think about a lot is that what what [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] is giving us is exponential power and in a mesopoetic way we can say the power of gods when you hear descriptions of zeus's [3597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3597.68s)

lightning bolt or you know what any of the power of kind of ancient god descriptions is like and then you look at the power of the nuclear bomb or you look at the fact that we can actually make new life forms with genetic engineering or destroy whole ecosystems it's the power of gods but without the love and the wisdom of gods to properly [3615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3615.119s)

guide it that's a bad equation so then i say well what are what excites me the most is not things that are giving us more power but things that are increasing the love and wisdom so we can hold the already tremendous power we have better yes and so the things that excite me the most is the increased awareness in lots of people and increasingly more into various aspects of popular culture about trauma healing and healing and and development and spirituality in general where people could be less reactive and more aware there's of course plenty of healing work that is gibberish or narcissistic but there is also good stuff in the space music and also the amount of attention and this is less popular it's more on the fringe but the amount of attention that people are starting to give to the idea that we actually have to redesign civilization in a pretty deep way it's not just that [3680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3680.079s)

we need to pick a new candidate in a uh system or whatever it's hey even if we had three parties even if we had five parties even if we had a different kind of liquid voting structure just the process of making propositions in a shitty way will inherently polarize the population we actually need something better than that what is [3700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3700.64s)

post-democracy uh capitalism seems to have developed a lot of technologies that we like it's true it's also caused all the catastrophic problems in the world and now is is with the cause of the [[perverse incentive]] and market forces that are driving us towards larger catastrophes how do we have [3718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3718.96s)

systems of allocating resources and motivating people and making choices that are better than capitalism and we know that it's not a regress to any of the other [[economic system|economic systems]] that have already failed it's not communism socialism but it's can we actually think up some better stuff [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3740.24s)

and we can because you know communism and capitalism and socialism all had to contend with certain things like how do we have a labor force how do we incent a labor force which is going to be most people do shitty stuff that nobody wants to do running the plow all the time more than you know building the roads or whatever and as we're moving into a phase of [3764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3764.4s)

technological automation where the things that people don't like to do mostly are because they're very rote and they don't involve creativity and the more wrote a thing is the easier it is to automate and then that technological automation either removes people's jobs and now the people are homeless they're terrified so they don't want the [3780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3780.88s)

automation or it makes possible totally new economic thinking because it removes one of the axioms that we have to make it to where the people need the jobs economically because the jobs need the people for society to get done so it's like oh there's actually one of the underlying axioms changed there's new possibilities opening [3799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3799.119s)

there's a lot of places where the axiom sets are changing and so there are more people starting to say can we do deeper re-imagining and redesign of the most foundational parts of civilization because maybe within capitalism and maybe within governments like democracies we don't have adequate answers but we [3821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3821.599s)

don't have to be stuck with those axiom sets and retrofitting them and that doesn't mean we go regressive to a previous horse thing but maybe they're maybe innovation in the [[social tech|social technology]] space is actually possible and so the people that are focused in that i would say one of the things that is most exciting to me [3839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3839.92s)

nice nice powerful stuff and i have a i have a final uh a final main question for you um based on everything i mean you a lot today uh based on everything that you've learned in your life relationships business your own spiritual you know practice [3862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3862.16s)

based on your experience if there were three let's say obviously there's gonna be more but if there were let's see the three most important life lessons that you if you could only pass these uh three keys life lessons to the next generation you could hand the next generation you know these keys [3883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3883.359s)

wisdoms uh to your children their grandchildren they'll be passed down uh what what would the three key life lessons that you would like to pass on to the next generation that you feel would evolve the next generation the most oh my goodness small question yeah i'm not at these at fake daniel it's at [3911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3911.359s)

stake right now these three keys we want the three keys yeah okay okay well i'll tell you the first thought that comes up is yeah that we're used to having whatever wisdom people figured out in the past that we've accepted from science or spirituality or culture or whatever and or that we figure out and wanting to pass the things that we figured out on to new people without paying as much attention to why did some people figure out those things more than others and how do we pass on the process of people figuring stuff out for themselves and so like i could i i can ask how do i get more people [3955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3955.44s)

to believe the that buddha figured out or that einstein did or that newton did but i'm more interested in why did buddha and einstein and newton figure out the that they did that other people weren't what was different about the process of inquiry that they had that had them have such a deep curiosity such a deep [3977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=3977.119s)

epistemic drive and a willingness to stay in the inquiry long enough that they didn't need to defect into somebody else's previous answer and to like have enough self-trust to really be in the experimentation process to figure new stuff out what i what i'm really interested in in education more than passing on previous wisdoms is the process by which people discover wisdom on their own and how and so like if i'm getting to talk to a kid the fact that they're asking me questions is more interesting to me than any answer i can give them nice and so i might have some answers for them but [4022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4022.559s)

mostly i actually want to keep fostering their curiosity itself and so they asked me the question why do the tree roots do this and my first answer isn't to answer it i'm like well why do you think it might be and let's look around what are some different ideas why are you interested in that and [4041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4041.28s)

like i want to help them learn how to think and explore on their own more and keep deepening their connection to their own interests so i would say that that's a meta answer to anything else i would say about specific insights i'd pass on we can still do specific insights if you want or we can [4064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4064.88s)

stick with that one yeah no i mean i i i i i'm feeling your answer if there are specific insights that you would like to pass on knowing that you know you've set the context uh the process is more important if there were any just learnings from your life knowing that hey each person still has to find their [4083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4083.2s)

own tap into their own wisdom but you know maybe there's something that you've learned that would would be supportive in some way i'm curious i'm curious what what you know a couple of things may be so i'll share the things that come to mind first and come to feeling first without [4102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4102.4s)

having um pre-identified that these would be my top three yes i would want to share with people something that kind of is intuitively known to kids but help deepen it which is that life is beautiful and sacred period all of it and to [4131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4131.6s)

uh that experiencing the beauty of life is actually meaningful independent of doing anything taking in the the beauty of it being odd being moved by it and then the doing that is meaningful is the doing that arises from that it from really seeing reality and and the meaningfulness of it the beauty of it the sacredness of it [4158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4158.0s)

how i then seek to serve it to protect it to add to that beauty arising from there is the right way to find dharma and purpose and path and right action nice that's one thing i would share beautiful and another thing i would share is that we get conditioned [4181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4181.679s)

to think that we need something from the world in order to be happy we need uh approval of other people we need status we need attention we need money we need credit and so we go about seeking how do we get those things from the world and what we're affirming is our own emptiness that i am fundamentally lacking empty needing something from the world and what we end up experiencing even if we attain some of those things is more of our own self-affirmation of emptiness so that process goes forever and it's just connected uh from both the fullness of our self that's always accessible and the and the fullness of life [4226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4226.96s)

and when i die which is really soon all the things that i got are done and yet whatever ways that i touched the world continue to ripple on after i'm gone so there is more expansiveness there is more permanence in the arrow of how i am touching the world and what i'm trying [4250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4250.719s)

to get from it and i'm focused on what can i actually offer to the world i'm affirming having something to offer as opposed to when i'm focused on getting something i'm affirming being empty and needy and as i am affirming that i have something to offer i'm actually feeling my own fullness [4269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4269.44s)

this is that like the book of luke to those who have marshall be given to those who don't have the little they have will be taken away but having is this state of awareness and so if someone can move from thinking that they are a little needy thing that needs something from the world and other people and projecting the love they didn't get from their parents on everyone else and trying to get the approval and avoid the judgment of everyone else which will just lead to a miserable life and instead like think about okay let's imagine that i died and the spiritual idea of becoming a guardian angel was a real thing i became [4309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4309.44s)

a guardian angel i could see people but they couldn't see me and i had the ability to help them but they would never know would i do it and most people as they sit in that where they realize that they wouldn't be getting anything out of it they're like yes i would still do it and there's this kind of beauty and being able to see the [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4328.8s)

experience of others and the happiness of others actually flourish and and so to say okay how can i come from that place more beautiful and maybe the third last thing i would say is that the idea of me as a separate self like as a as an individual as a being is just a both spiritually and [4352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4352.0s)

scientifically bad idea it's oncologically impossible because if i think about me as a separate being i have to what i'm saying is that i can think about me without thinking about all the plants and yet without all the plants making an atmosphere of oxygen i don't exist so how separate am i from that which i [4371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4371.84s)

inextricably depend upon but if i can think about me without thinking about the plants then i can actually harm the plants to my advantage but i'm in the slow suiciding process by doing so and i say who am i without thinking in words that other people invented and taking for granted concepts that other people came up with and being able [4393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4393.92s)

to interact with the world that has all the stuff that other people produced and the soil microbes and the gravitational field and electromagnetism who would i do without the sun or the galactic center and we're as i actually depend on the entire universe existing for me to exist yes and be if i'm a separate self is actually just gibberish but if i believe the gibberish not only will i feel separate but i will be able to think that it's reasonable to advantage myself at the expense of those other things that that i think i'm not actually the result of and so if i get no there is you can't separate me from universe take me out of universe and i don't exist [4432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4432.56s)

then advantage myself isn't the idea it's how do i seek to grow all that i'm connected with which is me and all of life and the relationship between those and then i see myself as an [[emergent property]] of the whole that has uniqueness but is inextricably interconnected and how do i how do i make choices from that place [4455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4455.92s)

so those are maybe three specific very beautiful beautiful keywords we are we are soul talking right now daniel beautiful i i really uh feeling you folks then you'll just share three of his wisdoms from life learning obviously you know the encouragement find your own truth but uh really really [4479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4479.36s)

insightful beautiful wisdoms there touching touching indeed you know then as we as we wrap up i would love you know you talked about wanting to to foster the curiosity is there a is there a simple uh question that you could leave those listening today as a homework assignment that you you [4499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4499.36s)

feel would be a a question that they can reflect on to deepen their own uh exploration and curiosity in their own [[evolutionary process]] what what's what's let's say one question that you could leave the listeners with yeah i actually love that you asked the [4516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4516.159s)

question that way because it assumes that the right homework assignment would be a question which i i think is right and if people were to journal on it and reflect on it i i think that this is quite useful so i can ask the same question in a few different ways i would ask um maybe the simplest way is [4541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4541.12s)

i can say what do i love and just to give more insight into that question i can ask what do i care about what is meaningful to me what do i hold to be sacred what is beautiful and what do i want my life to be in service to in devotion to and if someone holds those questions and reflects on them [4579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4579.92s)

um i i tend to find that that clarity makes what am i here to do much clearer love it i love the question folks you heard the uh the homework assignment the question what do i love what's meaningful to me what's beautiful what do i want my life to be uh in service to the the invitation to reflect on the question meditate journal explore uh i hope you've uh enjoyed this episode of soul talk with the amazing daniel schmuckenberger daniel what's the best way uh if people want to find out more about your work what what's the website what's the best way [4624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-Od0e0gq0&t=4624.96s)
