the stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of what's happening now all right welcome everyone to the stowa i'm peter limberg the steward of the stoa and the stowe is a place for us to go here and dialogue about what matters most at the nice edge of this very [29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=29.039s)

moment and for those of you who may be new here to the store or watching for the first time what is estoa no one really knows some people call it a communal podcast a digital campfire a wisdom gym and it's probably better not to know one thing we do have here is a [47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=47.92s)

sensemaker in residence series this is a four-part series over a month where a sense maker comes in and tries to make sense of the world with us and today uh for the month of um october on mondays we are very lucky to have uh our friend daniel schmuckenberger visiting us and this series is called the digital [71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=71.119s)

porch and the idea here is we're coming in with no theme or agenda we're just going to sit on the digital porch with daniel and ask questions uh and this was daniel's idea because the original stoa uh the original name of the stowe was estoyly which meant the painted porch which is where the stoics uh got their name uh [92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=92.24s)

they just hung around the with xeno on the painted porch philosophizing with each other so that's what we're going to do today and um i will take daniel in in a moment and then and we'll jump into the protocols as well but if you were here the last time daniel was was here we [109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=109.2s)

ended the session with flowing through annoyingness sessions so every monday one of our facilitators tyson wegner has um purposes freestyle wrap with [[sensemaking]] and it's on a different link usually but we just kept it on this link and for this month tyson is going to experiment with something different [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=128.319s)

called rap unbattles uh rap battles you know use kind of rap to tear people down but rap unbattles is using um kind of this the same technique to bring people up so i'm to take in tyson in a moment to just um just kind of introduce this tyson are you with us right now if you're going to meet yourself [149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=149.52s)

yeah i'm here thanks peter yeah after party following the digital porch come hang out kick it we're going to battle rap stoa style and the best part is even if you've never rapped before you can still play so look forward to seeing you there cool thanks tyson and so that's going to be [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=167.44s)

on the same link uh after this session which is about 75 to 90 minutes i will take a bio break and then tyson will be tagged in and you can you can leave or stay and watch and or whatever you like um so in a moment i'm going to take daniel in and the protocols of today is if you have a question anytime uh during um the session just [184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=184.8s)

write it in the chat box um have like a cue or question beforehand i'll call on you unmute yourself ask a question to daniel if you want me to read on your behalf because this will go on youtube eventually just indicate that in the chat somehow and then i'll read on your behalf i think that's everything [201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=201.92s)

uh so that being said uh daniel uh welcome back good to be here thank you peter it's funny i'm seeing a few faces that i saw like an hour ago we just did a live q a with rebel wisdom so good to see some of you again they're jumping digital campfires um is there anything i'll start with the opening question but is there anything [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=229.599s)

you want to kind of set the frame for this series or for today i think something that happened in the last stoa session when it opened to questions um and someone was describing anxiety attacks and i was sharing things that have been useful for me around that and various personal topics is uh that's really fun it's actually really fun to get to address philosophy and practices that could be useful at a cultural and civilizational scale in the context of just what's actually alive for people and real questions real dialogue rather than just in the theory [272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=272.16s)

uh place and with specific topics so most of the time if i'm on a podcast it is to share some topical body of content and so uh the idea of making a space to have no topic and just address what's alive for people sounded uh fun and worthwhile and like it would probably end up surfacing conversations that don't happen [294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=294.32s)

elsewhere so i'm looking forward to seeing what happens awesome um and i sent a google uh um doc for taking notes i didn't know who's going to take notes but someone's jumping in and taking a lead on that which is awesome and so the idea here is we're going to have um each session we'll take notes so [310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=310.08s)

we can have a body of knowledge that we can uh work with um so the first question that i have and someone basically asked it to in the chats um maybe if you um feel up for it to describe the consilience project again because i know you introduced it publicly at rebel wisdom recently under their war of [[sensemaking]] and you and i have been chatting uh about it for a last little while and someone had a question um related to the stoa uh how can a place a digital campfire like this though help with this project so maybe like a one-on-one on the project and how can we help with it i think i won't explain the concept project from scratch since there [350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=350.88s)

are a couple videos that do that and someone can just check it out and i don't want to take a bunch of time covering that since i think many people heard it but the consensus project overall is seeking to facilitate a development in culture where people have increasing [368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=368.24s)

value around both their own better [[sensemaking]] of the world and their ability to sense make other people's perspective experience and [[sensemaking]] and communicate effectively so that we might be better able to do coordinated problem solving for the big problems that we care about that we're not doing a very good job with currently and uh making sense of [391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=391.8s)

what's really going on with [[climate change]] and environmental issues whatever is hard by itself like the complexity of those is tricky but then to also make sense of how that's connected to geopolitical issues and market issues and other things based where one strategy that benefits a part of it [409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=409.84s)

could harm something else and different sub-populations are focused on different parts of the overall landscape that they care about more that requires pretty deep sense-making of not just complex issues but how lots of complex issues are interconnected and how lots of other people are making [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=426.0s)

sense of it valuing it how they're going to respond to get a sense of how do we actually move forward together and if everything that we do elicits a counter response that is trying to counter the things that we do and there's a kind of [[arms race]] of escalation of effective counter responses the coordination cost is too high to really [444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=444.72s)

solve any of our major problems and we are actually driving [[arms race]] in conflict in the process so a cultural value around both better and more holistic and integrated [[sensemaking]] and better communication so we can coordinate particularly with people that see things differently than we do because we have to because we [465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=465.199s)

inhabit the planet we just because we disagree with them and call them stupid doesn't mean they stop existing and stop doing stuff um that's kind of the cultural set of values and stoicism as like one of the uh schools of greek philosophy had a lot to do with how do we increase our self-awareness and our [489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=489.12s)

emotional resilience so that we are not as easily hijacked by group think and [[narrative warfare]] and emotional reactivity that we can actually reflect on our values and our sense-making and make good choices from that place and so if you take that as one of the you know one of those schools that was [510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=510.879s)

co-occurring with more of the kind of aristotelian pythagorean type schools of can we can we get logic better can we get science and empirical observation better and with the kind of socratic dialogue type school can we have better quality conversation and understand each other better if i can understand myself understand [530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=530.48s)

others understand [[base reality]] communicate effectively across those the whole population can do that we have a much better chance of engaging in something like collective problem solving or governance so considering this project has certain things that we're going to do directly in terms of types of education and content that we put out to try to help make sense of current world events and teach people how to do that but it's also seeking to facilitate the cultural movement towards these goals writ large which means every project that is trying to make better digital tools for helping people search data sets and make sense of [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=569.279s)

things or better news projects or better [[public education]] projects or better trauma processing projects we want to be able to help kind of recognize all of those as part of a shared movement to upgrade culture and to facilitate those together so i think the stoa has the ability to be a place where [590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=590.8s)

practice can occur somebody can learn an epistemic tool and then say okay well what does this actually look like how do i generate a landscape of all of the narratives on a particular topic how do we steal man those are we doing a good job with it how do we then move from steel manning a narrative to trying to actually empirically verify and falsify [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=609.12s)

individual propositions so all of the aspects of epistemics and conversation that one is learning they need a place to practice awesome um so we're having tons of questions and they're all gonna probably come at you from different angles so i'm um looking at them so rob you're up next [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=635.44s)

okay it's a long one bear with me um in my industry there's a pattern common in many industries where the key decision makers have a great deal of capital and influence while the employees and contractors seem to have a lot more understanding of the systemic needs and pressures that we face and we we end up losing the game of influence [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=655.12s)

those of us who feel more informed even though we have the relevant info and plenty of will and i think that matches the pattern that i see across many industries so the question is for those who are low in the hierarchical stack what can we do to be more effective in making systemic change when [674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=674.72s)

the owners of capital have other ends yeah that's a great pretty perennial social organization question uh there's a lot of different answers right unions historically have been an answer let's be able to get those people into some unionized force that has symmetry with um capital ownership democracy has been an answer so forming [702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=702.16s)

a union in the private sector is one answer forming a public sector where we say let's make a government of foreign by the people that actually has a monopoly of force even bigger than the top of the private sector capital ownership that can enforce rule of law that's another answer but of course capital will end up capturing the regulatory body if the people are not fully educated informed and engaged and actively being the regulatory body and most nobody here probably is engaged in government all that often as a citizen so it's not of for and by the people governance it is a permanent political class largely captured by an economic class and people that have other to do and then complain about bad government but are consenting to be governed by rulers by not being actively engaged in their own self-determination um so there's a lot of different kinds of answers right so politics would be one answer unionizing [758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=758.079s)

would be another answer getting better at the game of power inside of the private sector is another answer so figure out how to ladder climb more effectively so that you can influence things by being in the c-suite or in the board or do a better job at capital accumulation so that you can influence things as a [779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=779.44s)

shareholder or whatever what i would say is true across all of those another would be create [[public education]] to change consumer demands right so that the customers are actually demanding something different so supply has to create something different because there's a change in demand so those are all classic answers right [802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=802.48s)

but what i would say that they all have in common and other ones that we could give is that in addition to the intelligence one might have about the topic there is a strategic intelligence that also has to be there the strategic intelligence is doing like what we're doing right now what are the different ways [823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=823.04s)

to be able to influence what are ways that i could do what are ways that i could move into increasing influence that wouldn't corrupt the thing that we're doing and in this given situation of the various pathways which ones actually make no sense and are most actualizable by the people asking it and so what i would say is if [840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=840.399s)

you want to be more influential because you believe that you have [[sensemaking]] that should be more coupled to choice making then you actually have to increase the kind of intelligence not just sense-making intelligence but the kind of intelligence of how influence itself works could you expand on that last point just [863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=863.839s)

a bit more when i say how influence works you could say how power works which is also synonymous with how strategy works right which is what i'm saying by strategic intelligence so okay if the if there's a game of power meaning that rooted in things like [[private property]] ownership is a uh my ability as a person or a family or a corporation or a nation to advance my balance sheet independent of or even at the expense of others of the commons and there is all kinds of evolutionary advantage to get more capital accumulation and have that capital in service of [914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=914.48s)

generating more capital and there's scarcity of resource and as a result of scarcity of resource driving value there's a basis to artificial artificially manufacture more scarcity if i happen to be doing well at that right as you as you understand those types of dynamics the underlying [[conflict theory]] then you say okay those who get those who figure out how say we started a market t equals zero everyone has the exact same amount of resource and position people won't be equally good at the thing right some people um partly because of luck but partly because of orientation and aptitude and capacity will start to get more resources in the [955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=955.44s)

system and as soon as they have more resources they have more capacity to generate more resources they can employ more people they can do more to affect the mindsets of other people through media they can influence government through lobbying more they can apply they can contract private intelligence they can make sure their kids get the [972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=972.079s)

best education whatever right so if someone gets more resource they both have the incentive and capacity to protect that asymmetry of resource and grow it so then you end up getting a power law distribution and wealth and that ends up being an inexorable thing power law distribution so then you say [989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=989.04s)

okay well if i'm not at the top of the power law distribution what do i what do i do if i want to influence this we'll either have to figure out how to get up there that's a certain kind of strategic insight how does that work what what what are the ways to actually do that or i have to say so there's a power law [1004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1004.88s)

distribution in economic wealth what are the other things that could affect that well if i'm down here i don't have cemetery of power up here so i don't have real influence but if i got all of us together so that's say all of us as workers which is a union or all of us as consumers which could create an [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1021.36s)

influence on supply side so can i do consumer education or all of us forming a government that could then bind this with rule of law um or can i build a technology that increases my power through leverage right so these are basically strategic insights around how do i how does the game of power work and in the presence of that being the thing that is determining what happens largely if i have a sense that there are better things that could happen how do i also develop the capability to see what the pathways to have any influence are now how one studies that so that i mean you can study military [1067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1067.36s)

theory which is a very good thing to study you can study [[game theory]] and study coordination there you can study psychology you can study the biographies of self-made successful people you can study types of asymmetric technology for the most part anyone who gets good at the game of power also gets captured [1091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1091.84s)

by it and so in a way those who are who seem like they have the most freedom in agency are also the most bound to keep doing the kinds of things that they have to do to maintain that position so like it's you can [1112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1112.64s)

critique a world leading critique putin all you want for different things but you're like in the presence of the pressures that nato and the us were giving and the economic interests to be able to take as much of the wealth out of the ussr as possible and whatever could he have really done something all that different right in the presence of ubiquitous [[game theory]] you either get good enough to protect your people and do your thing or you don't and you end up losing to someone else who's doing that and so you can see that the people who seem like they have the most power are also the most obligated to behave in certain ways given that position and for the most part those who are pursuing power are doing it because of psychological dispositions to pursue power and then that's getting conditioned in the process and so then if there are people who are psychologically not disposed to try to get power [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1169.12s)

and they're more disposed to care about the whole but they have no ability to influence anything and those who influence it have given up really caring for the whole and or become completely bound by the nature of the system that's that thing drives extinction right that separation of um virtue wisdom [1188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1188.32s)

goodness and power those things have to be recoupled and and that means that anyone who has been pursuing virtue and wisdom and goodness well who feels like they have some insights into how to make better systems also has to learn how to increasingly gain the capacity to [1215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1215.679s)

be effective in the current [[world system]] without becoming captured by it or in service to it anjon you had a question that would be good to take on that hey daniel um it's a related question um how can you actually get better at games of power while still remaining [[game b]] committed i'm thinking that power corrupts or you get caught up in the game or just when i pay this mortgage off or i'll just do this for two more years et cetera et cetera i mean being kind-hearted you're also often at a disadvantage versus those who don't give a trying to see who is speaking is there a video on it's not coming to the first page he had his video off maybe that's why ah okay i heard most of it um can you put video on and just say one more part of it so i can connect to vr andren are you are you there still or um i don't have video right now okay okay how do you study the game of power without getting captured by it is the question how do you get effective at it without getting captured by it yep uh partly you have you have to know what is actually sacred to you that you actually have loyalty and [1331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1331.44s)

devotion to beyond utilitarian success in the game of power so you know what choices you don't take and what you're actually taking in service to um and to the extent that someone actually has a real embodied knowing of what is sacred [1354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1354.08s)

to them that is worth more than their own personal advancement or life and their life is in service to that to the extent that that's embodied and real and congruent is the extent to which they can be safe vessels for power then there's continuous blind spot monitoring and noticing [1378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1378.559s)

okay where is uh some unfulfilled childhood recognition need actually coming up and affecting what i think is the most useful thing to do in service to what i care about that is really just recognition or actual com competitive ecodynamics or mate signaling or whatever it is [1402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1402.64s)

so there's the need for like there has to be an extremely high value on what you actually value and a value on integrity and impeccability to motivate you to have enough self-inquiry to be looking at and adjusting those things oftentimes like it was easier when someone believed in a [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1424.08s)

all-seeing punishing and rewarding god because then there's a motive to be impeccable because not one jot not one tittle shall go unjudged before the day of judgment right and so but if i don't believe in a judging god then why not get away with this thing that i could get away with if i'm the only one who knows and [1444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1444.799s)

so then there's a question of do i actually have a sense of what is meaningful beyond just what is that personally advantageous that is deep enough that i have a basis for self-respect that requires integrity that makes me require integrity of myself uh the deeper that process is [1471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1471.6s)

the more someone can be a safe vessel for power and then trusted people around you that can check you most people who get into positions of power get surrounded by yes men who all want something from them and as a result continue to say the things that double down on the bias that brought the person there [1494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1494.08s)

um if you are earnest in your desire to wield influence for actual collective good then you should know that there are blind spots in yourself you can't see and there is [[collective intelligence]] that exceeds your own intelligence about what is right and so you should be actively seeking that [[collective intelligence]] about the situation and actively seeking it about your own self now that doesn't you have to be very careful of who do you trust who they are as people and they're knowing of you enough that you're really seeking to share enough with them that they can give you that reflection but that's important that's the compliment daniel how does how does one not be handicapped by having a [[game b]] commitment in playing games of power the example that comes to mind is elon musk just firing somebody turning around and not even thinking about it twice but somebody with a kinder heart something like that being much harder [1558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1558.0s)

you can do the hard thing if it's the right thing right if kinder heart makes you so sensitive to that person that you aren't going to make a choice that would be better for lots of people in the whole then the kindness is actually myopic if you on the other side rationalize [1593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1593.52s)

this is the right choice for the whole and so you don't feel any empathy for that person and you don't take any considerations around it then you also become deadened and there's a dangerousness in that so i wanted to i want to care about the experience of that person and if i have to let them go i want to feel that but i also don't [1617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1617.6s)

want my feeling that to make me myopic and not make the choice that is in service of the greater good uh i have a follow-up that you can swat away and it has to do with your personal relationship with power um especially when you've you're you're gaining increase of influence and your voice is [1640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1640.559s)

is getting heard um is there any moments in your life where you felt like you were in a wrong relationship with power and what did you do to correct that and maybe what kind of ecology of practices or relationships you have in order to keep you in right relationship with power i grew up nearly maximally blind [1666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1666.64s)

to power dynamics and that was partly because of being homeschooled with no kids around like even just the nature of school school yard stuff and clicks and bowling and whatever i just i didn't get and because of the great fortune of having like reading a lot and as a kid but having being exposed to good things so i was um reading the works of a lot of the great philosophers that those were actually the people i was being exposed to and that's how i thought people were um and it was very strange because there was this there was this kind of cognitive dissonance that i didn't learn until later where because then i got [1714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1714.88s)

involved in activism and i saw [[factory farm|factory farms]] and i just instantly wanted to kill all the people that would do anything like a [[factory farm]] i saw the the yulin dog meat festival and i just wanted to remove that part of the world um but so i knew or study [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1735.2s)

uh how creative we've gotten with torture methods so i knew that there was gruesome abuse of power in the world but i was on the outside of it looking at it and the few people that i was relating with were also on the outside of it looking at it so then i had this kind of default that whenever i was talking to someone i assumed they weren't part of it and hadn't been conditioned by it because we were only ever talking about solving world problems because the only thing i like talking about because they were interested in that i assumed that we were kind of looking at this thing together so i ended up trusting people i [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1773.76s)

shouldn't have trusted and then having projects be harmed as a result of that because i was seeing the highest in people and wanting to be redemptive all of the time and um and creating an environment where the only the highest values and the more what were being talked about because the nature of the conversation and then i also had people assuming i [1794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1794.24s)

was playing games of power who were more power literate because they couldn't believe that i was as educated as i was about say sciences and i was as stupid as i was about the game of power and i just i just had a very uneven development that way and so then they would say you're just naivete signaling right now [1811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1811.679s)

assuming that i actually knew the game of power and i was signaling being naive to it as a method of playing the game of power effectively um and i was just like what the are you talking about i don't know it was very it was disheartening and frustrating and so then i'm like okay i have to understand this so then it was finally time to read [1827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1827.6s)

machiavelli and um robert green and all like that and and even then there was still an outsideness where i'm like okay so i understand those dynamics but anybody who i'm talking to about those dynamics is uh and so it's been a progressive process for me i also had this thing where it made so much sense and i'm so [1853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1853.36s)

grateful for it and yet it also seems so naive and silly to me now when i when i was a kid and for kind of most of my growing up i never asked what do i want to do with my life i asked what does the world need and what should humanity do from kind of this omniscient perspective right and that was very useful because i [1879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1879.36s)

i thought i couldn't figure out what i should do if i don't have a sense of what humanity needs like i'm embedded in this thing i'm a part of it so i need to figure that out first but that meant that i i wasn't thinking in terms of my own agency of what i could affect so i was i had was thinking about the [1894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1894.799s)

sense-making of what would make it better decoupled from the how do we get there that was both extremely useful and extremely naive and so then had to get into the okay so the enactment problem we can't just do this and that perfect [[world system]] comes about even if we get some people to agree how do we deal with the fact that [1916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1916.0s)

the other people who don't agree to the non-uh nuclear proliferation agreement and who build all the nukes end up in running the world how how do we deal with those types of issues and then there was like a begrudging acceptance of that the path from if you will game a to [1933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1933.2s)

[[game b]] requires capacity in both it is neither game a nor is it [[game b]] game a for game a sake is to win at the game of power for the purpose of the game of power [[game b]] to be played in full requires that being the game or the context and it's not yet so that how do we move from where we are [1958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1958.96s)

to there requires being able to not be beat by game a right which means understanding it while actually not seeking to serve its aims but seeking to change the nature of the game itself and um so that that that's a little part of um kind of my history with it and then uh [1981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=1981.919s)

finding people who i think understand topics better than i do and seeking their input and particularly finding people understand topics better than i do who disagree with each other and trying to understand their perspectives more and also where they agree and where they disagree [2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2006.799s)

and why uh across topics this has always been something super important to me and very helpful and then also i think i used to err in the side of seeking people's feedback for my own growth too much because it was because i knew that anybody's feedback about me has some value even if it's largely their own trigger [2033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2033.84s)

there's still the question of why didn't i have the attunement to know that would be triggering to them how could i have communicated more effectively to them right there's going to be signal in it even if what they're saying is not objectively true and that's assuming that they're communicating in good faith which i came to recognize is not a fair [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2051.839s)

thing to assume all the time and it takes a lot of time because there's a lot of people and it's not all equally valuable so then starting to say okay i'm going to be more selective in the people who uh not who agree with me but who i respect both their good faith and earnestness [2070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2070.0s)

and their perspective and be seeking their input yeah it's an awesome heuristic i'm going to sneak in a follow-up question so something that we're looking forward to doing at the store eventually to develop courses and one that you know i think is as neat as having a power literacy uh course and as i mentioned to you [2090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2090.96s)

robert greene the laws of power is coming to the store soon uh where he's agreed to come on at least um and you mentioned like studying [[game theory]] the great great people who've achieved power is there any one single source that you know of that has the most bang for your buck when it comes to uh understanding power [2108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2108.48s)

probably robert green okay i mean what he did in the 33 strategies of war and the 48 laws was take a lot of the classics of military theory or political theory and break them into fairly simple principles and then stories that illustrate the principles and doing it across cultures and doing it in a popular way where you [2133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2133.599s)

don't have to really understand um what this particular period and prussian history was about to get the cultural context of why they were writing that way or whatever as far as an intro i think those are probably the best intros the thing i've noticed about them is most of the people who i have seen read [2162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2162.4s)

them 48 laws in particular uh get damaged by them because it you know there isn't something like a game a [[game b]] context there there isn't something like the problem of rivalrous games driving [[arms race|arms races]] causing eventual self-termination it's just [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2187.52s)

looking at history of what won and let's understand the thing that wins and even in the introduction there's this concept of um the only thing that wins is the game of power and so if you have any ethics or virtue at all you better get good at the game of power because otherwise you won't be effective [2203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2203.92s)

which is not all that different than something i just said but there's this subtle thing where it can actually someone can interpret that in a way that rationalizes sociopathy and utilitarianism in general can make you rationalize sociopathy hey i'm doing this for this good reason so i don't feel bad about the thing that i'm [2222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2222.96s)

harming one of the problems with utilitarianism is my modeling of the future to say if i don't do this this will happen usually is more i'm assuming more certainty than is actually warranted and it's on the basis of that false excessive certainty that i rationalize the harm [2242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2242.32s)

that i cause if we don't do this thing then china will do this thing well there's like 20 steps of unknown stuff in there but assuming that thing to be certain and true then i do a one-step certain harm causing now and this is tricky this is where virtue [2262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2262.24s)

ethics are needed to kind of um offset utilitarian ethics you have to be doing both you have to be thinking about the process and the results and the recursion between them there was a question that was bubbling up in me uh wanting to inquire about your thoughts on power relating to evil um but maybe i'll put that on pause and throw another question too and maybe you can decide which one resonates more uh up in the chat someone was mentioning about um what was it again uh sexual selection how that question uh uh was sort of dodged on the eric weinstein's uh podcaster appearance that the person [2300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2300.72s)

who said it was evaded i haven't listened to that one and then the previous stoa session you said you might address it at a different still appearance which is related to power sexual selection dynamics um so i'll throw that out for you the question um so the question is uh do you uh [2317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2317.359s)

so i'll read what the person said daniel evaded answering question on sexual selection on both eric's and previous stoa sessions how does sexual selection impact game a [[game b]] so i can give you my sense of what a [[game b]] answer is which is very different than what the most ethical game a answers are meaning that different axiom sets are going to have us answer that differently so from an evolutionary bio perspective evolution is the result of mutation survival and mating right some mutations end up being more successful at surviving and mating they go through and then you get recombinatorial dynamics in the mating of the ones that were able to survive and mate and that that process and so there's obviously a strong impulse to survive and a strong impulse to mate and a strong impulse to mate with whatever else looks like is also evolutionarily maximal mating [2404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2404.56s)

opportunity and so a lot of people take [[conflict theory]] down to this level and say either the malthusian thing on survival humans reproduce geometrically resources reproduce arithmetically eventually there will be more people than there are resources than scarcity of resource for survival of drives [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2430.16s)

inexorable competition over over the not everyone can attain the same stuff that's kind of a survival selection answer and it's it's wrong by the way though uh it makes all the sense in the world why malthus said it at the time but when he said humans reproduce geometrically that was before the inflection curves in [2454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2454.24s)

population that really started to happen where populations were going down without exogenous pressures and we can see in the nordic countries and in japan and in wealthier places the population curves have stabilized and even went down without exogenous pressures and it was also before us getting the ability to create a closed-loop material [2471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2471.359s)

economy and recycle stuff and upcycle stuff so we don't end up needing more resource that is only reproducing arithmetically forever we can upcycle it so that that insight um needs amended and then when it comes to mate selection it's a similar thing like if i assume monogamy is the social [2492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2492.8s)

contra construct um and specifically for mating and that everyone has a biological imperative to move their own genes forward more than caring about somebody else's genes or society as a whole or whatever else then there will be a place at which you and i both [2512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2512.8s)

want the same mate we both can't have her it's a fundament she's a rivalrous good in that way and i either beat you or you beat me to be able to have that mating opportunity um now of course uh not all societies have been rigorously monogamous we can look at polyandrus or [2534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2534.16s)

polygamous or promiscuous societies and see that there were different ways of relating to this all of which still had some [[conflict theory]] and [[game theory]] there was different ways of solving it one of the things that what one of the arguments as to why monogamy was more selected for and there's many arguments [2552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2552.88s)

here and i think it's a deep topic but one of the positive arguments brett makes brett weinstein is it was a way to ensure that all the men got to mate and so they had to when they were young kind of posture do whatever peacocking they needed to land a mate but then once they had it [2573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2573.92s)

you had some social convention where all the guys got to have a sexual and procreative opportunity and then they weren't gonna have more and as a result if i knew you weren't gonna gonna try to mate with my wife then we could coordinate together where if i didn't know that you weren't going to try that [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2591.599s)

then i have to always stay in competition with you and if there's a bunch of men who aren't getting their mating needs met they'll just break the civilization because it's not meeting their needs so how do we make it to where all the men have their base need met and then stop competing with each other because they kind of got the thing they need [2605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2605.2s)

now of course that is an idealized version that pretends that adultery wasn't ubiquitous um and you know etc but uh my [[game b]] answer is that the sexual impulse i mean and this is true even in monogamy in monogamy there's the recognition that you will have sexual impulse towards people other than the person you're [2638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2638.4s)

married to that you're going to witness and not act on right so there is this recognition that you don't act on every impulse and that there are some choices that lead to a healthy life in a healthy society and there are other impulses that don't that you have the capacity to have some volitional [2655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2655.04s)

override on i would say that we can just extend that um but it's that same kind of principle and of course in polyamory there's a similar extension i can witness my jealousy impulse and not be controlled by it in the same way i can witness my promiscuity impulse and not be controlled by it can i gain increasing sovereignty over [2677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2677.04s)

my being hijacked by sexual desire and being hijacked by rivalrous desire or any of those things can i gain the ability to witness all of them and not be automatically controlled so that my virtues and values can actually be the basis of my choice making and i would say whether we're in a monogamous a polyamorous [2698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2698.079s)

a mixed whatever kind of set of social constructs the basis of it is that is that and and i think here's the core argument and this is why i actually there's a limit to evolutionary psychology that i end up being unhappy with the answers it generates all the time is [2725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2725.76s)

we have capacities that were not evolutionarily selected for directly but are the exceptions of what was selected for right so nature selected for the capacity for recursive abstraction because it led to tool building and coordination for hunting but now that recursive abstraction gives us the ability to do things that were not [2751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2751.04s)

part of our evolutionary selective environment but we have the capacity so it's not default that they will be deployed that way but it's possible for us to deploy them that way and if we if we look in the rest of nature other than humans on this biosphere we are we are really not like anything [2769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2769.28s)

else in the amount of impact that we're able to have on all of the ecosystems that we're in and the nature and the speed the speed coupling in particular so mostly we don't compare ourselves to viruses or mycelium we compare ourselves to [[apex predator|apex predators]] and i think people here have heard me [2790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2790.079s)

talk about this before [[apex predator]] theory is not a good model for humans because orcas can't leave the ocean and go hunt on land and polar bears can't go hunting the savannah we were able to become the [[apex predator]] in every environment so rather than hunt to a certain level and then have our population checked they also didn't start [[factory farm|factory farms]] they also didn't do [[species extinction]] at scale because and i mean i've used this example so many times but an orc is going to catch one seal or one fish at a time and it's going to miss a lot of times and then you look at a drift net a mile long drift net that pulls up a hundred thousand fish at once and [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2831.92s)

you're like that's not [[apex predator]] right like that dwarfs and orca's impact on fish populations so much that it's incomparable so if we keep modeling ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] and needing to up regulate our apexness relative to the other people so we have to deploy our [[exponential tech|exponential technologies]] of domination and whatever to compete with each other we do destroy we both drive [[arms race|arms races]] where the direct conflict is bigger than the playing field can handle and where the externality is bigger than the playing field can handle so the thing i would say is that our choice making capacities because of abstraction and technology [2870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2870.72s)

are evolutionarily unprecedented no other animals can impact the world in the way we can as a result of that our evolutionary or our choice making basis has to also be evolutionarily unprecedented and it can be um and so our capacity to witness evolutionary impulses in ourselves and neither automatically be controlled by [2895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2895.28s)

them nor shame them just witness them understand them and then have a choice-making basis that is more the result of um reflection abstraction values consideration is key to that question um so feel free to swat this one away and i'm being playfully nosey today um but when it comes to the [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2920.319s)

the monogamy poly kind of distinction how do you relate to that what was your sort of pathway and your choice i have been happily monogamous i've been happily polyamorous i've been happily celibate it was important for me to explore be with nobody be with one person be [2944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2944.24s)

with more than one person so that i had first person experience of it i had knowledge of it and that it was actually a choice because if i couldn't do some of them then it wasn't really a choice it was a default if my jealousy was so intense that um my partner being with someone else would [2965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2965.2s)

really freak me out make me lose my then and then when i say i'm choosing monogamy because of this that and the other value that's really the rational backfill to i just can't handle something else um or similarly if i couldn't choose monogamy because i'm super afraid of being trapped and afraid of commitments [2983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=2983.68s)

and can't control lust processes and whatever then i say i'm choosing the other one and it's a default so it was important to me to have experience in that i can navigate i could navigate different models right i could navigate different cultural models but [3002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3002.079s)

who am i as a being and showing up to relationships with other people is deeper than the models and does my okayness come from a specific model does it come from the agreement that this person will never behave in these ways and if they do i'm totally up or that i definitely you know get the opportunity to behave [3020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3020.559s)

with these people in these ways or does it come from a deeper place than that and so i can't like at this point i can't really imagine being bothered by who someone chose to have sex with like that's just not gonna bother me i also can't imagine feeling like i need to have sex with somebody in particular [3043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3043.839s)

um and so those are just not things that control me and that means that there is not a obligation to a particular model of i need to get my needs met i think coming to relationships from the point of view and this is kind of like common u.s california um [[personal development]] language of like needs meeting i think it it can actually go in a pretty bad direction which is hey i have these needs we're in relationship i need you to meet my needs is actually just psycho babble for codependency and because i need you to meet my needs [3092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3092.16s)

means i can't be not up unless i control your behavior i need you to behave a particular way for me to be okay no you don't you were fine before you ever met that person if that person died you'd grieve and something else would occur if that person was doing that thing that you really hate but you just moved your attention to something else and got distracted you'd be fine it's the but as soon as i say i need this person to do that thing i'm conditionalizing my happiness and then i'm making that true for myself now of course i might have boundaries of [3129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3129.359s)

i know the kinds of things i'm interested in and if someone doesn't want to do the kinds of things i'm interested in it just doesn't make sense for us to do this thing together like i'm i'm interested in relationships where we're honest and if someone else is not interested in honesty or not capable of it i'm just not going to choose to do a [3146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3146.079s)

deep relationship with them but i'm not saying i need you to be honest with me no i don't i can just interact with you differently so i think the coming to a relationship from a place of sovereignty and wholeness not from a place of seeking to get your needs met in it is a critical part of [3166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3166.0s)

navigating monogamy serial monogamy polyamory any of those well um so people are cheering me on to keep asking you questions so i'll just ask one more um in let's say you said you're happily monogamous happy uh happily polly happily celibate what virtues did you learn with each of those what virtues emerged [3189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3189.04s)

yeah it's a great question i think there are times where i think there are things that can be learned in celibacy differently i won't say they're the only way to learn it but they can be learned differently than through other life experiences i think they're all of the kind of tantric [3218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3218.72s)

practices of notice sexual energy arise and see if you can learn how to move it see if you can learn how to direct that in a different way and direct it in to creativity and to other things there's really interesting stuff one has to do when they don't just go to immediate release [3241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3241.04s)

of a very strong evolutionary energy there's also something around when you meditate and your nose itches and you don't scratch it you just witness it which says i am not controlled by every biologic impulse that arises i don't have to scratch it like i'll be fine if it just itches and i watch it there's something around [3258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3258.4s)

if i can watch a very strong sexual impulse and not have to scratch the itch i become more trustworthy including more trustworthy to myself there's also a place of being able to have a lot more attention with yourself that can make you both more reflective and more noticing and integrating shadow elements and all kinds of things like that [3289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3289.359s)

when you don't put a huge amount of your attention on other people and when you aren't seeking to get fulfillment from other people right away but seeking to notice your where unfulfillment arises inside of you and inquire more into it and work with that there's a lot of wholeness and sovereignty that can be developed that [3308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3308.48s)

way and specifically if someone is coming from codependence sometimes that phase is necessary it's actually necessary before getting to interdependence to go through a phase of deep independence that involves even things like sexual sovereignty um monogamy uh in forests one of his landry is one [3336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3336.319s)

of his books there's a line that i think is just beautifully expressed that the line is uh for every freedom multiple new limits arise and for every limit multiple new freedoms arise and this is the recognition that freedom and limitation are words that can't be defined without [3357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3357.68s)

each other or a synonym of them they're co-defining concepts but they're also co-defining realities and so the idea the desire for just more freedom is fundamentally a kind of immaturity as opposed to that every freedom has limitations that come with it costs and investments that come with it [3384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3384.72s)

and i have to embrace them together and so i'm actually not choosing more freedom in an absolute sense i'm choosing the freedoms that are more meaningful to me so monogamy is a very nice structure to be able to give up some things give up some freedoms [3404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3404.079s)

and feel good about it and not indulge feeling resentful or lacking or bad about it as an as a choice not because i have to because of something that i am choosing because of a freedom i want so maybe i want to be able to go to places of depth and commitment psychologically sexually emotionally with her where i have to create a safe enough container [3427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3427.52s)

for that for that to be possible that's a freedom there's a freedom that we can explore certain things in that container that might not be possible outside of it and there are certain limitations i'm fully willing to embrace for that um in open relationship there's this idea hey that's common of [3448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3448.64s)

rather than try to get all of your needs met from one person which makes you kind of resent them and manipulate them to be someone they aren't you try to force your husband to [[dance]] and he sucks at dancing but he's good at other things but you're disappointed in him because he's not that thing and you like it or whatever how about just get different needs met [3466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3466.64s)

from different people and love each person for who they are it sounds like a nice idea and there's some niceness to it but there is in the monogamous dynamic of course to some degree we just get different social needs met from different people that we don't have to be having sex with it's called friends and community and family [3484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3484.559s)

that you can have intellectual and relational experiences with but there's also a place of being like hey i want to grow with you where the things that are really meaningful to you i want to grow into and develop to some capacity even if i wasn't interested in it on my own in that topic or that thing because i'm interested in you and i'm interested [3503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3503.44s)

in the connection we have and there's really um yeah there's something very beautiful about that and around saying where we could diversify our attention into other relationships we want to keep deepening it and let's see how deep can we go into the depths of knowing each other and knowing ourselves [3525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3525.52s)

through the way we know each other so there's these are all things that monogamy can do very beautifully and there's more and open relationship and each of these also have a shadow right there is coming to celibacy because of just shame around sex and bodies or because of just sucking interpersonally [3547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3547.44s)

and not wanting to keep feeling rejected um or you know other things like that just being wounded in a relationship and just retreating into the wound um there's pathological versions of monogamy that are really about control and jealousy and insecurity and trying to get your security met through a very secure structure whatever there's pathological open relationship [3570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3570.48s)

that more has to do with immaturities around more freedom and of fear of commitment intimacy whatever i think some of the things that can be learned in open relationship well is different people bring out different aspects of us and the more intimate a relationship is which doesn't have to be sexual but [3596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3596.0s)

obviously that brings a whole depth of intimacy we've we might find that there are like it's a common thing i hear people in open relationship who are doing it thoughtfully say is wow i went places in my experience with you that i've never went with anyone else but that's true for everyone there with [3616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3616.24s)

because it's just the universe is a big place experience is a big place and that the different chemistries of those people coming together make different kinds of like unlock different things the way they trigger each other the way they facilitate each other the way they muse each other so that's one thing the other thing is [3635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3635.44s)

the ability to be very connected to someone really not ambivalent about them and also not try to control them is a very deep process it says i love you i want to be connected i'm not ambivalent about you and i ultimately want for you all the things you want for yourself that are good for you and even if some of that takes you away [3656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3656.559s)

from me i want that more than i want to try to control something that is not what you most want that's a very deep and profound and beautiful process of moving more into something that i think deserves to be called love than control and insecurity um also getting to work past rivalry and getting to have a [3679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3679.76s)

sense of like okay i'm doing this prayer about my desire for the well-being of all mankind and holding all humanity as brothers but really if you with my woman i'm gonna hit you in the face i'm just holding you as a rival and my prayers don't really mean anything right like so then there's a question of like what does it mean to say i want for everybody and i want to embrace people's brothers and i want to have non-rivalrouss dynamics like there's a very deep way and like the the more intimate the thing that's being shared is the more depth of intimacy in that relationship and the more overcoming rivalry and kind of interactions have to occur so i think all of those structures can be explored in a mature way valuably i think they can all be described in a mature way for actual shadow reasons in a kind of pre-trans fallacy and that's what i see more often [3741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3741.52s)

than not i think open relationship is harder just fundamentally harder than monogamy because monogamy if you notice in our when i say our culture i'm giving a stat about the us but i i think um much of the modern developed world is similar when you look at the divorce rate and [3761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3761.52s)

the infidelity rate and the people who are neither divorced nor in infidelity but who are together sexlessly or miserably um it's pretty  high across those three right and you look at how many long-term marriages are there that are really fulfilling and beautiful it's like okay people suck at that just with one person and it's because relationship is [3787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3787.52s)

actually a hard thing it's i have to like pay attention to my triggers and my feelings and my wants and my worldview and my desires and somebody else's at the same time and neither compromise what i really need for what they want which will just make me resentful know or push for what i want in a way that will end up making them resentful i [3808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3808.0s)

have to actually i have to be able to hold more than myself but including myself simultaneously right and i would say everything that's hard in politics this is a microcosm of and then of course a family with kids now we got to do that for more people we got to be able to be tuned in to and aware of this whole field of interacting [3828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3828.079s)

people um i would say that most people can't even deal with their own needs and feelings and wants and desires and thoughts without um driving themselves crazy most of the time let alone trying to do two people at once so uh multiple relationships are taking what most people are already barely only [3854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3854.0s)

succeeding at and trying to say now let's do multiple of those at once plus it's a second order equation because of the interaction of all of those so um i i have not seen people do really well at open relationship who didn't do really well at monogamy um i've seen people who claim they do [3875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3875.359s)

and under the hood it's actually pretty  up um but doing well at monogamy involves like being able to be really committed to someone and problem solve and work through difficult things and an open relationship is actually being really committed to more than one person and being really committed to someone and the other people that [3894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3894.48s)

they're with right as part of an ecosystem that's just if someone chooses to do that they're also going to choose to invest a lot of development effort in it yeah that was super awesome um so i'm gonna stop hogging you and then pass it to the question to someone else uh just wanna be sensitive to the time [3917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3917.359s)

uh we're past the hour mark uh are you okay to go to uh 20 more minutes uh sure yeah okay um hannah you had a question okay so originally i was going to ask about um systemic trauma and your strategy surrounding that but what is more likely to me right now [3942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3942.24s)

is you know there are some people like us at the stoa who are interested in developing sovereignty and there are some people for whom that is not a concern and we work with these people and we're friends with these people and we're in relationships with these people so what what are your strategies for continuing to develop sovereignty [3966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=3966.079s)

in relationship to and in connection to this ecology of people who are not doing that so there's a few ways to answer this so one way is you think about when someone uh is transplanting a small tree they plant a tree in a place they put tree stakes around it because it hasn't yet established its root base [4005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4005.2s)

maybe they put a fence around it to protect it from deer or whatever it is once it establishes its root base you might be able to you know tie things to it and use it as a stabilizer but to begin with it needs stabilized in people's [[personal development]] it's that way for most people where there is a desire to be able to be [4027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4027.44s)

stable in a particular set of capacities or virtues or values to be able to help other people with it but there's also the honest developmental recognition when that's not true yet and doing that will just pull the little tree over and that the developmentally right thing is to be around people further ahead [4046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4046.319s)

than you in that particular line of development until it becomes stabilized enough that you can not be thrown off going into places and that are further off and you can actually help that's something i think is an important consideration so the i'll say a little bit more about [4066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4066.0s)

this because i think it's more important than most people acknowledge the so jewish saying proximity is destiny that who you are around is going to end up determining the course of your life more than any other single thing is and it's true because as social primates we're influenced by what we take in on [4089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4089.599s)

tv and by our own thinking and by our disciplines but we're more and and the physical environment we're in but we're more influenced by the people we're around than pretty much anything else and so being cognizant of that and that's why there's aphorisms like um keep the company of the wise and keep [4108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4108.0s)

the company of saints and whatever in every culture that has some wisdom to be like that's an important thing and then of course who are all the people seeking the company of the wise who aren't there there's obviously a developmental recognition that people get to a place where that can be more of an offering um so i would not try to help people ground in something you are not grounded in that's the first thing the next thing is when you're talking about your own desire to increase sovereignty and then that other people don't have that desire as much maintaining your own sovereignty with respect to the where they are [4153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4153.759s)

if you get if you get bent out of shape because they're not something else um that that's the place for your practice not for trying to change them um your ability to see them where they're at accept them except you're where you're at right and have some piece around that is [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4174.799s)

going to be important and then after those two i would say learning how to be more effective at influence is actually important sometimes that's paying attention to who you actually can influence and sometimes it's paying attention to what effective influence strategies are but the foundation of effective [4198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4198.64s)

influence strategies with regard to things like virtue development always start with your own [[embodiment]] and practice any follow-up hannah no i'm good thank you all right um jason you had a question hey yeah um so can you hear me great um so most of the time when i hear the term [[collective intelligence]] it's coming from the mouths of intellectuals who are a tiny fraction of society so i'm wondering how can we foster a [[collective intelligence]] that's inclusive and integrates other forms of wisdom beyond just education or kind of like whether it's self initiated or institutional [4256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4256.239s)

is there are there other paths that that can kind of bring us all up to speed without becoming an intellectual it's an interesting question there's several sub questions in there that i hear um one is does everyone have to develop their intellect for society to function well [4282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4282.88s)

and refining that would be how much development of intellect is necessary to engage as a citizen well and the other question is what types of human development other than intellect are meaningful and can contribute to collective capacity in some way and then how do we engage those effectively and maybe also a question around does everyone even have similar aptitude for all of the different kinds of intelligence and how do we um work with that and like those are all very interesting questions um the term [[collective intelligence]] is a term that is not exactly synonymous but close to synonymous with other terms that other groups use to mean more broad things like productive capacity right there is some relationship between those topics so for the most part traditional economists aren't going to talk about [[collective intelligence]] but they will talk about a society's productive capacity [4363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4363.199s)

and its productive base and they will recognize that the invisible hand of the market is an emergent [[collective intelligence]] that is contributed by all of the supply and demand and innovation patterns across the interaction of all those people so [[collective intelligence]] theory would look at the market as a [[collective intelligence]] mechanism and that what people want and the up regulation of who supplies that well and that driving innovation and whatever that whole kind of market theory you can look at that through the lens of [[collective intelligence]] and acknowledge that people's innovation their creativity their [4401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4401.6s)

desires all kinds of things are part of that other than just their intellect there's obviously study and [[collective intelligence]] of types of group problem solving and coherence and choice making that are other than intellectual like a tribe that gets together and they have a big decision to make [4424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4424.88s)

so they all start by dancing in a drum circle around a fire and that doesn't seem like an intellectual thing but what's happening is the drum circle itself is having the people do their own thing on the drum but also find synchrony with each other so there is a balancing of individuation and harmony [4443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4443.12s)

right of sovereignty and communion and the people who are dancing are all doing their own [[dance]] but all to the same base beat so similarly there is a embodied experience of being an individual in harmony with other individuals and that embodied experience where then they're seeing each other and seeing their eyes and having that experience [4469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4469.52s)

then they sit and they have a felt sense of their own individual place and their connectivity with each other that changes the state they're in when they go in to solve that problem so that's kind of like a [[social tech|social technology]] that's a pretty awesome [[social tech|social technology]] that evolution selected for for a long time [4486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4486.4s)

that isn't what you would consider an intellectual process but absolutely might increase the quality of problem solving of that group might it might even make their intellectual capacities more capable coming to bear we can look at other things that it probably does like move people from a more sympathetic to parasympathetic [4506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4506.0s)

place which makes executive function more capable and limbic hijack less possible and you know other things like that so the question of are there lots of different types of knowing and intelligence that are possible and important and can we figure out ways of engaging all of them and not over [4524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4524.08s)

norming on some of them is a super important question and well beyond the scope of me answering how we do that um will everyone be equally intellectual of course not just like will everyone be equally artistic or kind of course not is there a minimum [4546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4546.4s)

level of kindness and a minimum level of rationality that is necessary for people to be able to be part of effective social constructs yes and this is kind of the baseline of what we would call a culture or uh yeah if you think about the chakras as a model for types of intelligence [4576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4576.719s)

which is a good way to think about them that each one of them was like a a center of capacity or intelligence or wisdom or awakening or something like that um the chakra corresponding to the solar plexus would traditionally be interpreted as being associated with will [4603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4603.52s)

that the kind of intelligence that is is related to what we were talking about earlier with like power literacy is there's a the generator question there is how do i relate to this topic or this situation in a way that empowers me that's a kind of intelligence right it's a kind of intelligence to say what do i focus on what meaning do i give it how [4629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4629.04s)

do i relate with it that empowers me which is a different question than what is objectively true and provable it's a different kind of intelligence the chakra that we would associate with the throat having to do with communication if i'm communicating i'm not just talking at somebody i'm trying to create communion with them [4650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4650.48s)

i'm trying to find commonality um there's some purpose why we're talking so i'm wanting what i'm saying to be received and land right so i have to actually put myself to communicate effectively i have to put myself in the other person's shoes and say how would i communicate this thing to [4672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4672.8s)

them where this would land and wouldn't hit their triggers or be rejected so how do i communicate effectively involves empathy for the other and self-reflection around what is true for you and what your intent in communicating is those types of intelligence would be associated with that chakra [4693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4693.12s)

and so the intellect which is the capacity to discern what is same and what is different right what do what where is their sameness or commonality between things where is their difference or distinction and then what is the kind of relatedness you can think of intellect which is distinct from what we might call mind mind might [4719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4719.6s)

involve a lot of narratives running and a lot of identity and software but intellect is kind of just the pure compute function of the capacity for discernment discerning truth from falseness sameness from difference those types of things and that was actually in in the [4741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4741.199s)

yogic chakra system that was the very highest of the chakras before union with everything um what i would say is that any of the develop like the human developmental philosophic traditions i interpret that the highest thing they're offering is how to develop all of the parts of self for everybody [4770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4770.32s)

so we can say oh the you know the heart chakra the the path there is bhakti [[yoga]] about love and devotion or if it's uh and maybe the intellect would be gyan [[yoga]] and there are different paths and i can pick one i think the more kind of well-rounded interpretation is for us to connect with [4796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4796.96s)

all the dimensions of our self and develop all the dimensions of our self so that there gets to be a maximum wholeness of self in the fullest relationship of the wholeness of reality so if any for someone to say oh i'm an intellectual i don't need to feel their intellect is going to be limited by the depth of the experience of what [4820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4820.159s)

those symbols mean related to the ground of experience right um so i i want a culture where everyone values intellect and experience and artistry and awe and all of those things and everyone values developing all of those aspects in themselves in a way that is aligned and unique to who they are [4845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4845.04s)

not that everyone will be developing them identically or equally beautiful thank you awesome um so uh we have about five minutes left so let's uh end here um if uh there's any juicy questions in the chat maybe you can throw that google doc we have running so we can kind of save it for next time [4870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4870.56s)

or anything that came alive before i close out i'll hand it to daniel for any kind of concluding thoughts this is kind of a interesting ride that we went down with these questions but anything uh a live view at the moment oh just this is this is fun it's fun to have a group of people that care about these [4887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4887.52s)

things and want to take time to think and reflect and develop themselves and and create a community of shared development both for themselves and in thinking about society and civilization more broadly and the relationship between those of how do i become a citizen of the future i want to see how do i develop myself so [4907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4907.6s)

that i can actually apprehend that world and i'm a part of it um and so that i'm more capable of helping bring it about um that kind of bi-directional relationship super important and uh you know when you um offered for me to come and do the four [4927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=4927.92s)

times in a row i happened to be in a in a very busy time with trying to launch this project and so i was thinking okay maybe we'll do that in a couple years but um it doesn't actually take that much time since it's just questions and you're hosting it doing all the work of it and um and what i think i think this community is actually very well set to help the kind of movement process consilience project is working on asking these questions being in practice around it and uh so yeah this is fun and i think the intent or the hope was that these four get to build on each other so we don't need to ask the same questions again mostly we'll kind of ask new ones and maybe get to reference earlier things we talked about so be interesting to see where we get by the end of it beautiful um so i'll make some closing announcements in a moment but uh daniel my friend thank you for coming to the stoa uh during this busy time in your life and uh if you need the stoa in the store village to help you with the concealing project just let us know and hopefully uh some of the the questions that you're wrestling with will get asked here um so i'll make some closing announcements for upcoming events we got one tomorrow with michael taft [5009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=5009.679s)

from the uh was it the deconstructing yourself podcast that's um 12 p.m eastern time and then uh the most interesting man at the stoa nicholas benjamin has an event called concept unfolding uh nicholas could you unmute yourself and uh tell us what that's about [5026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=5026.239s)

i think you're still here i'm still here everybody so join me tomorrow for part two of concept unfolding where i expand on my methodology for creating concepts and pushing the limits of our language beautiful and that's at 6 00 p.m eastern time uh and then uh tyson i'll just take you [5047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=5047.76s)

in again just to kind of if anyone missed it what's happening on the same link uh after after this rap on battles all right yes right here in the same room is rap unbattles so it'll be an opportunity to practice dialect and good faith dialogue with one another some healthy argumentation in a musical way so join me even if [5066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=5066.88s)

you've never rapped before this is an opportunity for you to play and uh have a good time so i hope to see you there beautiful thank you tyson so i'm gonna have to bounce in a moment but i'll hand over the host access to tyson uh if you would like to see up more events we've got tons of events coming up um oh i'm so excited to announce this one uh keith johnstone the author of inpro uh he's like the founder pioneer of the improv movement he's coming to the stoa i'm super excited for that uh contra points the famous youtube personality she's coming on got a book that um so a lot of events coming up and go to the start at ca [5101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGjzGbPxVI&t=5101.199s)

check out our patreon account and then our sub stack the mailing list uh so that being said um i'll play some [[music]] go on a bio break and then tyson will take over in a moment so again daniel everyone thank you for coming out today you
