wellness force radio music feelings are essential but they can't dictate our actions to literally infect each other with our emotions we came here for a special purpose select the book with unveil except knowing without doing the same things not knowing there are not just trackers i'm gonna wear this and it's gonna help me do the right thing wellness force radio episode 96 with co-founder of the neuro hacker collective and cognitive enhancement specialist daniel sh martin berger how can we optimize our mind brain body system for increased quality of experience the highest stages of human development that we are used to seeing that seems so many standard deviations beyond normal can be the new baseline it's clear that people have radically increased demands on their cognitive ability there are more things causing distraction and competing for focus while an increased demand for productivity but they're looking for creative productive slow states where their cognitive capacities and their creative capacities are fully online and they have the right emotional state that goes along with that what could a person of normal intelligence do with their life if they fully dedicate themselves to developing themselves comprehensively for the benefit of humanity you are an [[emergent property]] of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing welcome back to [82](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=82.929s)

another episode my friend i am your host josh trent thank you for spending your time with me here on the podcast this is where every week i'm bringing you access to global experts in all things wellness behavior change and new technologies on this podcast you'll learn from exceptional people who are dedicating their lives to being a positive force for our physical and emotional wellness [104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=104.32s)

my intention with the show is that together we'll discover the connections between our emotions and healthy habits to live our best life and enjoy the process this episode is brought to you by perfect supplements a company i'm stoked to partner with who actually walks the talk with their values of non gmo pesticide free real food supplements that fuel us for the wellness journey [125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=125.38s)

head on over to perfect supplements dot-com slash wellness force enter code wellness force to save 10% off your entire order what's up my friends so excited you are here because we're about to have our hearts and minds expanded from our guest on today's show daniel sh martin berger daniel is a system designer strategist evolutionary philosopher and [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=143.26s)

the co-founder of the neuro hacker collective he leads a team of scientists technologists academics and creatives that are empowering individuals with new tools for optimized well-being actually discovered day's work and the neuro hacker collective organization through what seemed like almost weekly conversations and hearing testimonials from colleagues and friends [160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=160.81s)

that have been using qualia which we'll talk about on today's show it's this advanced cognitive enhancer that was allowing my friends to be more present and get 10x more done in their lives so about two months ago i decided to do a little n equals one experiment in this channel of mental performance and cognition which you'll hear about now we've had a handful of conversations [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=179.47s)

about nootropics and cognitive enhancement from experts on wellness force but today on the podcast what you're gonna get is so much deeper than just how to use new tools to succeed in life but the understanding of the what and the how to meet and overcome this sometimes overwhelming distractions and attention drains from people and things i feel so fortunate to have been able to [197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=197.8s)

visit daniel and the team at headquarters in encinitas because he has been studying health and neurology for over 25 years which led to qualia now early in life daniel was told there was no cure for his diagnosed neurological and autoimmune illness from either allopathic or complementary medicine yet through advanced studies and applications in physiology and pathology [218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=218.2s)

he healed himself this led him to become a student of mind-body medicine and an academic dean of a mind-body medicine college once healed and highly educated daniel began working with larger teams to solve global issues through what he calls an omni positive and omni considerate system to found the critical path institute and the emergence project a multi organization think-tank [239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=239.26s)

dedicated to improving our global civilization i think you're gonna love this episode as much as i did because we're talking about the things that really matter and our personal wellness and in our collective world you're gonna want to go through this episode at least twice head on over to wellness force.com forward slash qualia that's qu a li a for everything we talked about on this [258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=258.729s)

episode including my n equals one experiment where you can try that out for yourself which i feel so proud about and which was a labor of love with a message i can really stand behind you're gonna get so much value and growth in the next 60 minutes so let's jump in to this mind expanding and emotionally engaging in-depth conversation with one of the [275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=275.44s)

brightest and visionary minds in the world daniel 'shmock dan burger daniel thank you so much for coming on the show and for inviting me to your second home it's your work so you're here probably a lot thanks for coming on thanks for having today we're going to talk about things way beyond just quality a way beyond tropics and neuro hacking but what i'm [292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=292.24s)

really digging for is something about you that maybe people haven't heard before you know something that shows a little bit about your personality from your youth i know actually there was a space you came from in iowa you were homeschooled and it was from the works of buckminster fuller and david bohm that you had learned from but how did that shape you you know you're this [310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=310.539s)

young kid you're in an environment in iowa there's meditation going on how did you pull from that and what did that mean to what you do now well i would say one of the big unique fortunate things about bringing for me was i was mostly homeschooled and i happened to be in one meditation community but was in a number of different alternative communities that focused on [[personal development]] activism different forms and fields of science [[permaculture]] right my parents were interested in evolutionary topics and so we got to live in proximity to different cool thinkers and evolutionary topics but the benefit of the homeschooling was my parents were wanting to do an experiment the educational experiment which was before unschooling was the thing the idea was [353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=353.349s)

let's give them no fixed curriculum at all and expose them to as many things as possible see what their interests are and facilitate that and so this was my education growing up so i never had a fixed amount of spelling or handwriting or you know social studies or so my spelling still depends on spell checker completely my handwriting depends upon the fact that only used computers [376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=376.63s)

because i you know i never developed those things but i did get to dive into the sciences very deeply very early in a way that was untraditional that is a way that would would be the case for any kid if they were facilitated to follow what they were really interested in and so my early upbringing was all of the sciences all of the different philosophic traditions and all areas of activism but [396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=396.55s)

one of the other really neat things was because i didn't learn them in the contexts of subjects right this is social science this is biology this is physics i didn't even think of them in isolated way so i'd be cross applying principles from thermodynamics to astrophysics to cell biology to looking at what is true about how reality works across all of these because i didn't [419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=419.349s)

think of them in segmented ways and i didn't think of them in terms of discrete laws of a domain what age were you when you started to be fascinated about systems and about how things work i mean because is there a time we remember like i know when i was a kid i took a part of telephone and my curiosity i have this insatiable curiosity and i always wondered how [435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=435.759s)

things work so i wasn't satisfied unless i took it apart and put it back together did you feel like that in your life i mean how has that serves you i do how would you describe your curiosity the same as yours i'm the same as any other kids i maybe just had more facilitation so it happens with kids usually is they want to take apart the telephone they want to make lasers they want to you [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=455.86s)

know do all kinds of interesting things boys and particularly those ones but all genders whatever they're interested in is gonna be very deep but but also things that are more esoteric like i've never met a little kid who at 2 3 4 years old doesn't ask questions like why is the sky blue and we give them nonsense answers but to actually understand how the atmosphere works and [475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=475.81s)

how diffraction works and how light works and how that intersects with the way the rods and the cones and our eye work and what the [[subjective experience]] of blue compared to the actual objective experience of light scattering it's actually one of the deepest most profound things to answer that well that exposes them to everything from the hard problem of neuroscience to atmosphere [494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=494.53s)

sciences and where they're gonna learn about [[climate change]] and stellar formation and physics they ask why is fire hot it's the same kind of thing right like well we can talk about what the photon releasing is and how photons are exchanging energy in the hand but then why are my subjectively experiencing it as hot and so what happens is we just don't know so we [514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=514.779s)

don't answer their questions well and we instead steer them to things that we do know that are really not interesting like how to spell something or what the capital is something that is and we turn them off to schooling we turn them off to learning turn them off to their innate fascination of existing so when we look at the whole issue of the kind of welfare model dynamic where we think [534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=534.25s)

if people are not capitalistic aliy motivated they'll just watch tv all the time kids are so intrinsically motivated to learn everything they can and to build stuff and to create and to like want to go to work with mom or dad and figure out how to do stuff what happens is when we don't facilitate their interests and then we actively force them to be interested in that's [553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=553.69s)

just not interesting to them because there's more to do with memorization and getting it right than understanding mechanics in or dynamics and interesting ways we break their innate intrinsic interest in life and make them deferring to extrinsic authority and then they just want to get away from that which ends up looking like play chill out is some form of you [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=570.24s)

know escape from broken interest in life so the future of education has the ability to have polymath be the new normal you know comprehensively developed multimodal genius as the new normal because that's actually innate to every child a friendly facility wow and the the way that i hear you explain things this is something that i think is endogenous to you i mean do you feel [592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=592.71s)

like your intelligence has blossomed from that environment how did you get through these stages of learning without going to this traditional schooling and then maybe tell us a little bit about how you found this cure for your auto degenerative disease that you had what was that like combine those two things for us so first part one of the things that i was struck by early is i was [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=611.73s)

studying very fortunate to come across the work of buck mr. fuller early in childhood and when you see as a older man he's got 49 honorary doctorates and everything from architecture to mathematics to engineering to most of fundamental sciences and did novel work in those areas like how does someone do novel work in mathematics when people have done so much brilliant work [636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=636.18s)

specializing in that and do novel game-changing work in architecture and language and it breaks our normal idea of how specialization in human capacity works but we see that being true in in davinci and in jefferson and all the people that we think of as these kind of renaissance people that are kind of comprehensively developed and it's easy for us to think that they are just [659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=659.13s)

somehow genetically different but one of the things that bucky fuller as an older person would always stay in like the beginning of his talks was that he was he became aware early in childhood that he had slightly below average intelligence by the normal metrics of intelligence that the other kids in school got spelling faster than him got math faster than him but some things [681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=681.18s)

happen some specific experiences where he became interested in figuring out what could a person of normal intelligence with their life if they fully dedicated themselves to developing themselves comprehensively for the benefit of humanity obviously there were some unique things happen for him to have an insight like that early on but you see [698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=698.879s)

then all that he developed as someone who he would say he was utterly convinced he had no endogenous no capacities that were beyond normal but a development process one of the things that's so interesting for me then was all the people who developed themselves to the kind of highest degrees of comprehensive development said things very similar and so it's clear to me [718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=718.829s)

that and you know then we've no very deeply into all of the evolutionary biology of the topics and educational theory that the highest stages of human development that we're used to seeing that seems so many standard deviations beyond normal can be the new baseline what was the stage where you went through where you realized a that you had something that was neurodegenerative [743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=743.97s)

i think a lot of people deal with illness i know i had a lot of health issues when i was in my 20s and in my 30s and was there a point where you realized eh i have something that i'm not exactly sure how to fix and then what did that road look like for you to heal so i was in undergraduate i was 18 i was rock climbing weightlifting healthy and then had symptoms start [766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=766.609s)

kicking on very rapidly that were kind of neuromuscular joint type things did not have a background in by our health at that point was studying math and physics and other topics and so you started studying seeing all of the doctors and integrative doctors and various kind of modalities they could and ended up figuring out a handful of underlying phenomena from inflammatory [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=789.089s)

conditions and the underlying causes in terms of toxicity and pathogenicity and things were more causing it for myself and end up reversing it fairly quickly what was the time period where it reversed three months wow three months and the initial diagnosis was rheumatic autoimmune disorder it doesn't have a cure doesn't traditionally have a cure so [810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=810.749s)

that was very neat and then i was you know free of symptom pathology for for many years until mmm 30 something and again very rapidly had an onset of something and it was probably the same underlying susceptibilities they hadn't been fully addressed previously they got read triggered by some new phenomena and then it was a much more aggressive onset with [833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=833.31s)

more complexity involved and that required me doing a much deeper dive into modeling it know that this was important so we look at something like ms or rheumatoid arthritis or als or any any kind of complex disease or psychiatric issues er but say we're looking at so we're looking at a rheumatic condition we will see correlation between that romantic [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=857.01s)

conditions statistically significant correlation and things like a particular kind of toxin exposure whether it's a heavy metal or whether it's an organophosphate or something like that we don't see one for one it's not everyone who has it has had that exposure or everybody's had that exposure has that disease but we see statistically meaningful correlation will see statistically meaningful correlation with a bunch of different forms of u of subclinical infections of lyme disease of exposure to mold biotoxins of gastrointestinal pathogens of you know but this ends up being very hard the traditional medical model is looking for one disease primarily having one pathway that is primarily causing it and then it's going to have one chemical [899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=899.46s)

that addresses that pathway but for our current medical approach is good for acute cause issues so this is why it's so great for emergency medicine because the cause is actually pretty acute it's pretty clear and you can address it but where you have chronic diseases that developed over some period of time and often times were multifactorial they don't have one causes they have multiple [921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=921.21s)

different causes it's not even the same multiple set for different people and there was delayed causation in terms of when the first thing happened and you have some underlying pathophysiology happening before symptomology occurs it's actually really tricky to figure out how that works and you don't treat a cluster of symptoms called a disease you actually have to see what is going on [939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=939.96s)

specific pathway wise for that person can be able to address that which is the future of personalized medicine you feel like you were really supporting all the systems underneath so that they're all happening in synergy what did you do specifically and then how did the different nootropics and the other other supplementation's that you were taking i [956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=956.19s)

mean how did that work for you the reason that i got into nootropics obviously as someone who's interested in learning i was interested in intelligence and interested in everything that could optimize that everything from you know meditation and technology assisted meditation like neurofeedback to specific kinds of brain training to better forms of learning [974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=974.49s)

right epistemology for how to learn but also biological enhancement of the hardware that learning operates on so i had worked with nootropics in cognitive chemistry but not as deeply or sophisticatedly cos there wasn't an eden right oftentimes in evolutionary need ended up driving but when those illnesses first kicked on in addition to having like a lot of neuromuscular [998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=998.82s)

symptoms ii there was cognitive symptoms all g was that massive brain fog you're going through what was it yeah so decreased cognitive capability how many hours per day i had that were cognitively viable and potency of cognitive capability and for me for the things i was interested in that was much more debilitating than physical debility because at that time you're doing [1019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1019.82s)

high-level thinking so you had to be cognitively capable it wasn't an option and all the things that i really care about affecting require solving hard problems right and so my focus was all right well if i'm gonna work on figuring out these kind of underlying disease structures so that i can get well to get back to my focus on the future of macroeconomics and governance and [1038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1038.45s)

infrastructure and kind of large-scale environmental and humanitarian things i'm gonna need a lot of cognitive bandwidth but figure these medical issues out so first i'm gonna focus on how to increase my cognitive bandwidth so i can apply the limited amount that i have to regulate it you know that was my leverage in and so that was a very deep dive in cognitive chemistry and that [1055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1055.85s)

looked like everything in the nootropic space the brain nutrient space the both kind of neural chemistry and neuro structure connectomics neurobiology smart drugs and looking at what are all the pathways that are involved in various aspects of cognition so short term memory long term memory speed of memory digit span verbal fluency focus concentration you know all of those [1079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1079.82s)

modeling out where this is being mediated by different neurotransmitters acetylcholine glutamate dopamine etc with the different pathways you literally mapped out everything that cascades into one another and understood how all these systems work for cognition well i most certainly did not map out how it actually works because i was [1098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1098.71s)

looking at that you know let's say i looked at a few hundred pathways and the interactions but i've got something like 10 to the 45 actual elements of complexity involved what i'm doing is still reductionistic just less reductionistic i'm not looking at single molecule solutions and especially not single molecule that are just overriding an endogenous regulatory pathway by [1120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1120.94s)

providing the engine chemical but looking at what is everything we know from the various disciplines about how those endogenous regulatory systems work and where breakdown in those systems can happen and then how to be able to assess what's going on and then support it in a customized fashion so i started with cognitive chemistry to have a cognitive clarity to continue work with a deeper [1140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1140.409s)

neural chemistry right there's that i knew that was not an adequate solution but it was a necessary partial solution which ends up being directly relevant to why this company exists and this company is something that's deeply impacted me i had six weeks of trying the product we're in talk about qualia and for people that don't know before i tell my story what our nootropics i mean there's [1158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1158.38s)

a buzz out there the wellness industry it's like one of the top seven trends or ten trends right now for people that want to optimize the way they show up in their life but if somebody hasn't heard of nootropics i mean what is a nootropic so the work no tropic is not precisely defined in a way that everyone uses it commonly but for the most part we can define nootropic as some chemical that [1180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1180.429s)

enhances some aspect of cognitive ability beyond normal baseline without meaningful side-effects and so if we're if we're dealing with someone's cognitive capability having dropped below baseline we're dealing with pathology of some kind even if it's subclinical pathology right alzheimer's is cognitive decline from pathology that we've defined very clearly brain fog is [1200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1200.83s)

generally not a clearly defined pathology but it is actually dysfunction so if we are correcting the underlying dysfunction to just come back to baseline that's very meaningful we would call that kind of medicine in the psycho neuropharmacology in the you know cognitive chemistry space and it's not medicine that's well understood or well defined but that [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1219.799s)

wouldn't be no tropics per se even though a lot of people use no tropics for that space no tropics are really looking at optimization beyond baseline how can i take some capacity and enhance it now then you have smart drugs so people who use adderall not for prescription purposes for an actual diagnosis function but are using it for [1239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1239.36s)

enhancement and will enhance something whether it's adderall that they're using or ritalin or modafinil what will be a trend or just lots of red bull red bulls a smart drug you could you could think that way right most of the time when we think smart drug we think pharmaceuticals some pharmaceutical that's usually for narcolepsy or a dd or some other kind of actual cognitive [1258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1258.29s)

decline disorder like alzheimer's or parkinson's people use levodopa right as parkinson's meant for increasing dopamine do different things like that so we usually think of some kind of pharma med first that is being used for an off-label purpose for enhancing some aspect of cognitive function and that does work but usually it works at the cost of both long-term dependency [1282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1282.77s)

long-term side effects and usually even fairly narrow up regulation with some real-time down regulation so when people are taking dopamine for instance they're seeking to increase dopamine production but they're not looking at how natural dopamine production and dopamine regulation works and so we don't want dopamine relatively fixed from outside stimulus we want to open to be able to [1304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1304.19s)

be adaptive to external stimulus as is appropriate and adaptive to all of the other chemicals that have exists in quite complex relationships with with serotonin and with gaba with the other catecholamines right and we also want to look at the whole chain of how dopa dopamine is produced to say if that chain is damaged somewhere right the person is not getting enough tyrosine or [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1324.38s)

phenyl alanine or they don't have enough of the vitamins that are involved in converting it b6 or c or etc and that can affect other things so dopamine might be the most obvious but if it's a tyrosine issue it might be affecting thyroid function a so not only do we not want to just go straight to the insane chemical and make them not adaptive but we don't want to lose the opportunity to [1347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1347.57s)

optimize the entire chain for all of those purposes and so smart drugs are not no tropics though they're people who are interested or oftentimes interested in both what we're interested in in the new tropic space and we specifically have a approach to no tropics it is a [[complex system]] informed approach to nootropics is how do we optimize some aspects of cognitive psychological [1371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1371.25s)

function sustainably where we don't have meaningful side-effects in real time like at all increasing focus but creating irritability or anger properties as well right that would be a long term downside the short term downside would be being anxious or irritable while you're on it we're having empathy go down or having digit span go down while focus goes up so our [1391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1391.08s)

goal when we saw at our all doing something like multi-billion dollar sales off label right off label purposes for people doing their tech startup or midterms or finals or with all the consequences associated we saw this [[exponential curve]] and not just on that but on a lot of smart drugs and on a $15,000,000,000 energy drink market and it's clear that people have radically increased demands on their cognitive ability we are slaves right now to notifications calendar is being chocked full i look at my brother's life i love my brother he has three kids and he has a full-time job and he's doing all these things and i and i look at him at the end of the day and he's drinking coffee and i'm like there's got to be a better way because he is a mirror of the [1434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1434.64s)

consciousness level and of the aptitude that's out there right now about people not really knowing what they can do to let some steam off and to refocus their attention so i had an experience that i want to share and it was six weeks your company was nice enough to give me a great supply and it was incredible i took a black label product which is not on the market yet but what happened is [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1453.3s)

that i woke up in the morning i did my meditation i went through my normal process and then i'm at ces eight podcast interviews in one day and going on stage to moderate a panel and an after-party and at the end of the day i was still thinking like wow i could actually connect with more people and never in my life haven't been able to be so focused and the same way that i'm [1473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1473.01s)

feeling you right now where i'm fully present i'm looking at someone's eyes there's no response in me where i need to look away or check my phone or not be here and that's something that's unique so beyond just the physical energy that i was feeling i mean what is that product tell us about qualia tell us what i was using to be able to have that incredible [1490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1490.56s)

day so the first thing that we looked at was you know as we were saying we see this exponential rise in products that people are taking to enhance some aspect of productive capability or focus or energy or clarity even if it is down regulating other things that matter even if it's causing dependence because the demand is so high alright the need is so high so as you're [1512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1512.07s)

mentioning with your brother and so many people there are more things causing distraction and competing for focus while an increased demand for productivity and the net result of those together is very stressful debilitating cetera so most people know if they take caffeine they can have increase in certain kinds of focus but if they take it above a certain level they're gonna [1534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1534.24s)

get then downsides anxiety jitters and they still if they actually pay attention and say they use quantified mind or cambridge online cognitive assessment or tools like that quantified self tools they'll see that some metrics of cognitive capability increase and other ones actually decrease in real time right so we've seen times where people have a lot more energy but [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1555.96s)

they're actually task switching so fast their follow through sport or things like that right so the first thing we did was we said all right so people who are buying off-label adderall or smart drinks or whatever it is are they actually really looking for and what they're looking for most of the time is not just increased arithmetic processing or increased verbal fluency or increased [1576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1576.06s)

digit span but they're looking for creative productive flow states where their cognitive capacities and their creative capacities are fully online and they have the right emotional state that goes along with them so cognitively there's a whole set of functions its short-term memory and long-term memory and speed of memory and digit span and verbal fluency and task [1596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1596.78s)

switching and depth of focus and attention span right all these classic cognitive metrics but it's the product of those together right none of them on their own and we actually really want to look at how do we lift all those together oh along with more internal drive and internal agency and more emotional resilience to disruptive external you [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1618.84s)

know phenomena creating almost of a virtual buffer around distraction and things that want to pull you out of that state whether it be flow state or just or just focused attention exactly there's 42 compounds and they all work together in synergy if we have time in the other show we'll talk about how is synergy and the emergence process work but the synergy of 42 ingredients i've [1638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1638.19s)

taken four brands of nootropics actually in the past two years and what i loved the most about qualia is that i could go all day long but still not feel that crash and i think people can relate to this if they've had too much coffee in a day that feeling of being jittery towards the end of the day it didn't occur so how did you design that how do these chemicals work together they're [1659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1659.309s)

not really chemicals right they're more things that are essential for us that our body needs there's some brain vitamins in there tell us about those we started by modeling what we were trying to enhance and as you were mentioning it was actually a lot of things that are not necessarily obvious at first right like increased presence isn't necessarily what people think of when [1676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1676.53s)

they're going for a nootropic and they think they want increased focus because often times increased focus will lead to irritability if someone tries to distract them so how do we have this is a common adderall thing it's like if i'm just coding it's cool but if someone distracts me i'm irritable and actually have a hard time in task switching how do we have more focus and more fluid [1693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1693.179s)

task switching and more presence wherever we are well enough perspective to then decide where we want to move our attention back to that's a lot of complex functions the other so we started by doing the cognitive and psychological modeling of what we were actually seeking to enhance the whole set of functions and experiences and then how those relate to each other once [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1711.6s)

we have that modeled and that's again that's novel right we didn't start with here's a disease state and here's the one thing that we're gonna try and adjust in that disease state or even here's an optimization goal and here's the one thing we started with a synergistic goal then we said let's look at since we're not modifying it via a meditation practice which is totally [1730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1730.11s)

valid or a psychotherapeutic practice cbt or something like that we're modifying it via modifying the underlying what is cbt for people that might not know cognitive behavioral therapy particular kind of effective psychotherapy for certain things we're very technology agnostic by the way we work with biochemistry we work with neuro technology so [1746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1746.69s)

transcranial stimulation of various kinds transcranial lasers magnetic deep stem electric stim ac/dc etc neurofeedback as well neurofeedback got brain access work genomics and genetic expression work as well as psychological modalities from mindfulness meditative modalities to underlying shifting of meaning trauma somatic therapies we're interested in anything that actually [1768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1768.83s)

works on some dynamics than being able to know which things are in the most meaningful for an individual person and their goals we'll get back to that but for this generalized purpose what we were looking for is once we understood what psychological and cognitive functions were seeking to optimize we wanted to see what physiology mediates those and so this is looking at [1788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1788.45s)

everything from the cell science and the neuro chemistry and are under chronology biophysics what's known about all the things that have causal relationships to short-term memory or to emotional resilience right so we look at all the pathways where some studies have happened so we started with a structured review meta-analysis of all the appropriate spaces to say okay [1808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1808.91s)

acetylcholine processing effects these things glutamate processing effects these things these ion channels are involved in right so then we end up having all these underlying physiologic pathways and then we model how those pathways the entire pathway and the regulatory process of those pathways work and how the pathways interact with each other to create these complex [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1829.31s)

feedback mechanisms which is why we're taking a [[complex system|complex systems]] approach to neuroscience and second row pharmacology once we model that out we said all right we want to actually enhance not just the level of some chemical right raises heal choline we want to enhance the regulatory capacity of this whole system so that when someone gets off it they don't have dependents because they [1850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1850.82s)

become we've just created a big exogenous stimuli another dependent on it but are exogenous stimuli was actually working through their endogenous their internal regulatory pathway to robust the resilience of that regulatory pathway so when they get off it the effects can be lasting so then we looked at how does the entire regulatory pathway work and what can we do to be [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1868.16s)

able to increase the capacity of that system i'm almost hearing from you this was an inventory of everything that works to make our cognition fire now would you say that nootropics decrease the time from once in ups to the other the message gets through or is this more making a folding of the safety of the axon of the neuron [1883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1883.92s)

what is it actually doing the nootropic in there between that space between the dendrite and everything what's happening there different things so say you just look at acetylcholine right that one neurotransmitter for a moment you can use something like cooper's na which is a very common nootropic which is what we call an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which was on the 4-hour body right [1906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1906.21s)

didn't tim ferriss write about that quite a bit probably yeah it's a common nootropic it's a plant derived neurotropic there are other things that are also acetylcholine esterase inhibitors both pharmaceutical and plant-based and what that's doing is there's an enzyme in the synapse oh you're talking about between the axon and the dendrite right in the synaptic [1923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1923.55s)

cleft there's an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine so you don't have excessive amounts of it but it can also break it down too fast so you then end up having deficient amounts with that cause brain fog if it's too fast in the breakdown it can write but it's important brain fog doesn't have one cause has lots of causes it can be from neuro inflammation it can be from [1939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1939.84s)

deficiency or excess of lots of different neurotransmitters so but that could be one of them so you can actually inhibit that enzyme so the same amount of acetylcholine that is coming out of the axon can actually get across the synapse more effectively that's one thing you could do if you're asking what's happening chemically so in acetylcholine esterase inhibitor would [1959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1959.01s)

be one way to modulate the acetylcholine pathway but once it gets across the synapse it's going to be actually getting up taken in the postsynaptic neuron in various receptors and so we could modulate one of those receptors so we can use things like rasa tam's piracetam aniracetam etc to upregulate say the acetylcholine uptake on the nmda complex that's another thing that we [1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=1980.34s)

could do we could do those in combination or separately we could actually provide more choline donors or acetyl donors for the body to make more acetylcholine we could provide the the catalysts like vitamin b5 and other things that helps take calling in acetylated so there's a lot of things that we can do to affect the acetylcholine pathway and that's just [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2002.36s)

one pathway then there's two stages why taking the first stage without food and then waiting and then food with the second stage i had to play around with a bit to find my perfect dose to where i could just be present but then not feel like i was too much energized tell us about that why you break it up into two i've never done that before [2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2019.57s)

okay so qualia currently has two bottles it's a program that someone would take just for clarity when we were initially modeling what are all of the chemicals that we know something meaningful about that could modify any of those underlying pathways we created a database of about 500 chemicals and looked at what the primary pathways they affect secondary pathways etc and then [2040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2040.96s)

we did a whole bunch of customized chemistry for this kind of cognitive enhancement goal where we were working with integrative doctors running very deep blood chemistry on people clinical chemistry brain scans genomics etc and then really working to optimize in very unique ways once we saw that we could get the kinds of effects we wanted to get really profound upregulation across [2065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2065.2s)

all the things they were interested in without any of the kinds of down regulation we wanted to avoid that we could assess then we wanted to see what portion of that could we do in a non customized fashion so that we could bring it at scale because obviously doing it that kind of customization at scale is very difficult and there's some things that we couldn't work with [2082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2082.629s)

because they're so specific to one set of genes that what would be beneficial for someone is too harmful to other people but we want to see which dynamics can we work with effectively across most of the population so then that looked like a you know a bunch of internal product development trials iterations were using 23andme tests as well that was one of the things some people were [2101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2101.98s)

giving us 23andme data some people are giving us illumina data some people were going much deeper and also looking at what's actually expressing but we're also of course just doing the analysis of all of the journal articles in various spaces and doing you know structured synthesis so the 42 is one iteration it's one iteration that ended up being the right one for us to come to [2128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2128.02s)

market with first but it's going to change in the reason there was two different things two different products specifically some of the ingredients absorb very well without food since these are pills that people are swallowing we could have things that were injections i am or iv or intranasal or but there's safety and regulatory reasons would be hard to sell needles as [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2145.18s)

well and if we don't have any moral issue with that if it's actually safe and effective we were just simply looking at what the safest way for things to go to the most number of people for the most enhancement can happen and so since we're having to do gi absorption then some things really absorb much better without food where they get to have [2166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2166.0s)

maximum surface area contact other things really need food for absorption and to avoid nausea and so in the particular stack of chemicals we were working with we ended up separating it for that purpose yeah one of the things you have on your site that's fascinating is your quota we believe fully optimized human beings lead to a better world people being productive and creative and [2182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2182.71s)

whatever that is theirs to do but in many ways our modern world works against us how do you feel like neuro hacker tell us about neuro hacker and what are you doing to address that to address the onslaught of these weapons of mass distraction as gay and katy hendricks call it regarding the quote that you mentioned from our website and ye no hacker exists is obviously we're working [2201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2201.91s)

on individual human optimization how can we optimize our mind brain body system for increased quality of experience and increase capability and we're interested in both increasing our quality of experience means less subjective suffering more subjective happiness quality of life right that's important because human experience is intrinsically meaningful and increasing [2225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2225.789s)

human capability and positive predisposition to solve problems and create things of meaning ends up affecting the experience of lots of other people and non people sentient things right and so if our focus is increasing the quality of sentient experience across everything then optimizing humans into being key to that whole process because most of the [2246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2246.369s)

problems in the world that we really care to change whether we're talking about economic inequality or war or crime or [[species extinction]] those are problems that are being caused by human action and human action is motivated by our worldview it's motivated by [[economic system|economic systems]] that predispose certain actions it's motivated by lots of things but one of the things that ends up motivating it [2265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2265.39s)

is our own biology and so when we realize that empathy runs on certain neural networks it can be biochemically up or downregulated complex thinking requires certain kinds of hardware right and neurophysiologic hardware interactions to occur everyone who's had their hormones very out of place or who's been sick or very [2285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2285.91s)

underslept knows that you can go into biochemical states it makes certain emotions or certain cognitive capabilities almost inaccessible and that make other ones almost unavoidable yeah and so while addressing human physiology is not sufficient for optimizing human experience and capability it is necessary it's a large piece and and how do you feel like neuro [2305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2305.89s)

hacker as a company what is your ethos with solving this on a gradual basis because these are massive issues that we're facing i mean it's not like overnight things are gonna change but what are some of the enrollment conversations that we can have with people that we care about that not only can use products like quality and nootropics but they can get behind this [2324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2324.28s)

mindset of having increased empathy and compassion for people we're built to be in a tribe jason silva talks about this in brain games how there is circuitry in the brain that actually wired us to care for other people and other tribes because that's how we would survive let's build into our structure our a's our seas our teas our g's well when you talk about how do we share the [[value system]] now you're talking about affecting people software right actually affecting belief structures value structures understanding structures which also predispose experience in behavior so if we think about people's worldview and their mimetics as kind of human software and that can be affected through education through psychotherapy through media right through what you're [2363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2363.37s)

doing media is affecting human software directly and then we think of human hardware as human physiology which not just medicine addressing dysfunction but we can think of a kind of bio optimization addressing optimized predisposition then we can also think about the hardware and the software of the collective where infrastructure where how we meet our physical needs in [2384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2384.69s)

relationship with the physical planet so transportation agriculture water energy production materials waste are the hardware of the collective and our [[social system|social systems]] economics governance law language how we have collective agreement fields for how we do [[decision making]] in beyond individual decisions it's the software the creative the hardware and the software of the individual and the collective represent a taxonomy it is necessary and sufficient for understanding human experience in human behavior and so not neural hacker but our the think tank that gave rise to neural hacker is focused on all of those quadrants and what has to happen within a particular time period to move us off of the current [[self-terminating]] path that we're on you know as a species and into a really viable path that is not only not [[self-terminating]] but that obsoletes the unnecessary causes of human induced suffering and optimizes quality of life potential now an ongoing life for all life and neuro hacker is addressing one part of that a big part of our emotional health comes from how we feel in our body and how a shady we [2450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2450.23s)

are throughout the day i mean it's hard to treat other people well and think good thoughts if you're walking around hangry one of the best ways to cure satiety and satiation is to add in powdered collagen to your drinks your waters and into your foods i use perfect supplements collagen it's sourced from 100% grass-fed cows that means there's no hormones pesticides or synthetics [2470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2470.09s)

because these are healthy cows that eat grass while the sick cows eat corn so beyond these healing powers of collagen for digestion and joint health it also has 20 grams of protein and 2 scoops which helps to curb appetite and increase that satiety one of the cool things about this collagen is that there's individual packets you can mix in water and you know what it tastes [2488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2488.69s)

like water i mean all of a sudden like glass has 10 grams 20 grams of protein and all the health benefits of having this non-gmo pasture-raised collagen in my bloodstream so don't walk around hangry pick up your grass-fed collagen feel better in your emotional body and your physical body every day it's part of the wellness force radio bundle and it's heavily discounted just for you [2508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2508.4s)

click over to perfect supplements comm slash wellness force to save 10% off the already discounted package and get more wellness in the process the elevation of consciousness through biological optimization so if we're taking care of ourselves i mean there's an adage out there you can't fill up someone else's cup if yours is empty if you're on a plane you have to put your mask on first [2527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2527.87s)

how do we do both how do we become either physically financially or just ahead how do we get ahead in life and take care of ourselves while also i believe there's a term that you have omni considerate to other people how do we do this and how does supplementation and nutrition and products qualia plug into that to be an omni considerate think about this if i asked [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2548.9s)

you who you are you'll tell me something but if i say we who are you without plants and you think about it and you think well who would you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist who would you be without the plants that produce the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist you were actually the [[emergent property]] of a biosphere that made you possible it was mediated by [2571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2571.73s)

plants and they were mediated by insects and microbes and a whole bunch of things right and so you can define yourself without thinking about the atmosphere in plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea because you'd actually don't exist without all of them you are fundamentally interdependent with the whole rest of the biosphere not just pasteur but the whole universe who are [2592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2592.73s)

you without gravity some it's a nonsense question right who are you without electromagnetism it's a nonsense question so you are an [[emergent property]] of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing so if you think of earth as actually you zoom out and you look at it from the outside [2614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2614.48s)

space-shuttle picture and you see that it's this tiny tiny little bitty organic spaceship traveling to this vast cosmos that's very inhospitable place and you realize that on this tiny little organic fragile spaceship together everything in there is interconnected profoundly and eggs are interconnected and the idea that there's this place called away where we can throw our trash and these [2637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2637.49s)

people called others that we can bomb and it's beneficial get their resources whatever that engenders their enmity back that whatever wherever the trash goes is affecting the air the water that deeley everyone is engaged with we have a level of technology that gives us global influence and everything that we do when we're talking here and the headphones that we're talking on have [2660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2660.77s)

plastics and metals and silicates etc that came almost every continent that had people and [[supply chain|supply chains]] around the whole world that were involved it took resources from the earth in ways that were fundamentally on renewable caused massive massive problems extinction level problems for many species and then turned it into trash on the other side we're doing these [2680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2680.63s)

seemingly benign behaviors like buying stuff this is actually affecting this little spaceship that we live on in ways that make it [[self-terminating]] very quickly we have a level of population that we never had it's been an exponential risin since then this revolution and a level of impact per capita within that population that again is exponential that cannot continue in [2700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2700.79s)

this way but we also have the technological capability to make fundamental changes where we don't have an [[exponential growth]] society where we don't have an [[economic system]] that requires year-over-year [[exponential growth]] on a finite planet which how the  would that make any sense to do an [[exponential growth]] economy forever or a linear [[materials economy]] that turns nature into trash on a finite planet and what's interesting is if you look at nature everything has a lifecycle everything comes up and everything goes down so there's 2,500 year old bristlecone pines i think that are on the earth but at some point they'll perish there's no such thing in nature as continual unlimited growth it doesn't exist so how do we address this here i'm [2739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2739.28s)

not saying that capitalism is wrong or that socialism is wrong or right or any of that what i'm trying to address is the way we're conscious in our life and the way that we take care of our biology through supplementation through nutrition and exercise how does that key into the neuro hacker mindset do we joke sometimes that you can take qualia as a performance optimizing technology to go [2762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2762.04s)

do whatever meaningless thing you might have been doing climbing a corporate ladder for a company that is mostly net harmful to life in the planet and to your own existence and we really hope you don't but there are so many people who are actually wanting to create very meaningful pieces of art and science and humanistic connection and and are actually at the limits of their [2788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2788.99s)

emotional resilience facing the difficulties in the world or at the limits of their ability to muster their energy and focus to do the difficult but meaningful things that are there so do those are the people we most want to affect and then the people who are currently not engaged in what would be most meaningful for them we want to help empower them to switch i think there's [2806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2806.62s)

someone listening and they're probably feeling oh my gosh she's so right i doing something that i know on some level is probably hurting other people or it's probably not in my best interest what does that look like for someone to change you know what are the practices or what are the mindsets that they can instill to first just be aware of the fact that what they're doing is not [2826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2826.43s)

aligned with who they are and then secondly what's the first few action steps they might take it's a deep process and we could have a future time if your listeners were interested dedicated to things like what does the future of the world look like in terms of the future of economics beyond the current sensation of capitalism the future of governance beyond the current [2844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2844.64s)

sensation of representative democracy the future of [[materials economy]] the future of medicine we could get into that and we could also talk about what it looks like transitionally at a macro level for society and what it can look like transitioning for individuals one thing i will say just as a as a partial offering towards this question is when people ask intrinsic motives so they ask [2865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2865.22s)

questions like if all my financial needs were already met in perpetuity what would i do they start to move in the right direction of what would be an innately meaningful to them when they asked if i could actually direct the gates foundation funds what would i do with it so they think about if i had a lot of resources what would be most meaningful for me to do so i'm not [2887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2887.99s)

looking at gaining like winning in a competitive system i'm looking at if i've already done that now what's actually interesting to do this is these are clarifying questions that are important and they ask what problems in the world bother them the most those are things that are theirs to actually do something about what touches them the most those are the things that are theirs to actually help protect them proliferate i feel like there's so many phases of technology i just got back from ces that are nudging people in the right direction of conscious living of being more aware of how they're feeling in their body and what they're doing with their mind and in their space and there was a previous video we'll link in the [2926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2926.09s)

show notes and it was from the hive and it was a profound talk it was an hour and a half i think of just some of the most intelligent minds going over some of the most interesting topics and one of the things you talked about was the internet of things measure the entire natural and built world commons in real-time to allocate resources tell us about what the commons are and then how [2944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2944.51s)

that end of things might actually allow us to solve some of these big issues in the world so why do we still burn coal for energy anywhere as opposed to renewable energy sources like solar and wind and etc well we have said for quite some time that solar is just not quite cost-effective yet well this one that's not true anymore in terms of having reach grid parity but [2968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2968.36s)

even like why would that be true well we could build a coal plant for less initial dollars and get coal moving into it and generate more watts per dollar a little bit more watts per dollar than a solar plant until recently but in the process of doing so the coal was releasing a huge amount of mercury into the atmosphere and water so much so that the large fish species have mercury [2993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=2993.8s)

levels that are well beyond any previous safe levels then again are putting neurotoxins and you know biotoxins of all kinds and putting zinc oxide nitrous oxide sulfates in the atmosphere that are doing mountaintop removal mining to get the coal that are damaging the ecosystem and so many ways and damaging human health directly right well what's the cost of that if we actually had to [3017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3017.71s)

fix it if we counted for it if we looked at what is all of the harm that comes to humans from those environmental toxins what is the total cost of the medical bills of that and how do you even count the cost of lost life and cancer and children and etc and then you said well let's say someone can burn coal but they can't leave the comments right which is that which affects everybody the the [3038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3038.74s)

natural war commons is a metaphor for everyone is a common world right that was just common to all of us are the natural commons is the natural world the built built world commons is the built infrastructure that we all participate in but let's particular on the natural world commons for a moment so with the coal example most of the cost right the actual negative the cost of burning coal [3062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3062.77s)

the company doesn't have to pay for it its externalize to the commons in the form of damaging ecosystems extinct tting species externalizing medical bills to future generations so everybody else pays for it right yeah now their profit margin goes up because they move the cost somewhere else that's called external ization well if [3084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3084.839s)

we said we can burn coal but you can't leave the commons net worse so the same amount of co2 has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes to scrub the co2 out of the atmosphere scrub the mercury out mine in a way that is regenerative to the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies that do that well the cost to do that would make coal something [3104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3104.819s)

like four orders of magnitude more expensive and solar would have reached grid parity the moment it was invented and so it's a nonsense [[economic system]] it is actually an extinction airy [[economic system]] it not only allows but incentivizes external ization of harm to the commons that is what led to coal making sense oversoul right and so many other things like that similar we can we [3127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3127.859s)

can look at that say we look at any [[species extinction]] issue it's been a result of destroying habitat or poaching or whatever a whale swimming in the ocean is worth nothing on anyone's balance sheet economically it's part of the natural world commons we can think of it that way it has its own balance sheet right it is a part of nature's balance sheet we just don't measure [3153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3153.21s)

those balance sheets and we don't care about them and we don't care about them in any way that we have metrics associated with but if there is a fishing boat that can do whaling that whales a million dollars in will mean in japan or somewhere right where that's a part of the commodities trade so that means that there's a million dollars of incentive to kill the whale and none to [3170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3170.19s)

leave it where it is which is why we have been extinct ting species at the radical rate that we have cutting down all growth forests overfishing the oceans is because everything's worth something to us commoditized and dead and not otherwise that the commons the balance sheet of the commons we don't measure and so we just steal from it right we externalize cost there and we [3187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3187.799s)

take its assets and the more we can take the assets of the commons and externalize our costs there the better we're doing in capitalism what would it look like for technology to measure this inventory for the comments so that everyone can win how do we how do we use tech to make a win-win when we look at the commons and inventory all that so the key thing that has to happen and in [3205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3205.77s)

the future of macroeconomics is that we have to make sure that what we're incentivizing people and companies and what we're incentivizing agents to do is omni positive so we're not giving anyone incentive meaning they get ahead economically by doing something that is fundamentally harming other agents arming the commons otherwise we're continuing to cause the problems at the [3228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3228.09s)

deepest level by incentivizing them based on what our counting systems right based on our [[value system|value systems]] and so what we need is to incentivize things in relationship to how omni positive they are which means you have to measure everything affected not just a few of the things but measure everything affected internalize all of those positives and negatives into the value [3247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3247.82s)

equation and then incentivize things accordingly so to the degree that we make an incentive of any agent more close to perfectly aligned with the well-being of other agents in the commons is the degree to which the [[economic system]] becomes a source for solutions to everything rather than us or for problems everything the internet of things is growing exponentially i [3269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3269.7s)

follow the work of peter diamandis and the xprize how do you see neuro hacker growing into someone that can be not just at that level of xprize but also like how are we gonna make the tricorder how are we gonna solve these big problems with that what do you feel about the future what are you excited about for the future of nirach so neural hackers goals specifically are [3289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3289.02s)

comprehensive human optimization and so this includes assessment includes therapeutics effective technology and includes the interpretive platforms that can do customization personalization and so the way to address brain fog or anxiety or ms for different people is different because they have different underlying causal mechanisms going on so we're look we're interested in the [3316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3316.86s)

assessment diagnostic system so right now neural hackers not doing medicine it's doing direct-to-consumer optimization we're doing fundamental research that is related to being able to advance medicine whether that happens in this company or an associated company but how to basically synthesize all the diagnostics that exists where we don't just look at individual biometrics in [3339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3339.87s)

relationship to a fixed reference range but we look at the resilience of those biometrics when stressed so we're looking at the homeostatic resilience of the system not just current homeostasis and we get to look at each of the biometrics in relationship to each other to understand complex inter causal patterns and so we're looking at how we interpret [3356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3356.16s)

and synthesize all diagnostics developing new systems of diagnostics that provide higher fidelity more meaningful data more affordably more liquid ously more frequently the right and ai interpretative platforms for being able to make appropriate sense of that and then the ability to vet all the effective technologies to not just this is effective for this disease or symptom [3377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3377.43s)

ology but for these pathways where then we can look at which pathways are involved for individual people and you know how they're weighted to then be able to have really personalized bio optimization then beyond by optimization you can also personalize people's psycho therapeutics because the kind of psychotherapy that's necessary for anxiety if it came on from an acute [3396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3396.57s)

incident of trauma and in adulthood versus if it was something that was there since childhood they're different kinds of psychotherapeutic processes just like there's different kinds of you know physiologic processes for similar symptom ologies so how do we customize everything that is meaningful optimizing human experience and capability how do we vet it for what's actually effective [3415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3415.98s)

understand what it's effective for synthesize it personalize it and do that progressively better at scale this is the dream dashboard i think everyone has been looking for where we can get all of our wellness effects data our blood testing data our 23andme we can get our you biome our gut microbiota on there we can get everything for our activity tracking having a dashboard we can just [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3437.79s)

check in with ourselves as a mirror of mindfulness and figure out how can i do one percent better today i think sometimes people get caught up in the tracking and the tracking becomes like what device am i gonna get or what system like in years or what supplement should i take and all these different things and they get lost because the intention behind all of it to just be [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3454.56s)

this biologically optimized human that's the intention that people need be following you know the people are listening and watching like don't get caught up in the device qualia is an incredible tool it's not the golden ticket that's going to heal your life however it will support you and all those systems you were talking about so you can make those good decisions and [3471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3471.48s)

you might find your golden ticket who knows so in leaving our show today this has been so much fun i want to ask you seven questions and they're really fast so if you get to know you okay the first question is what fascinates you the most i mean we already know that you have a high level of intelligence when it comes to biological systems but what about the [3487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3487.98s)

brain fascinates you the most as in regards to neuroplasticity the way that the brain can shift and mold and and change what lights you up when you think about neuroplasticity so interestingly our team just did a structured review of all the literature on neurogenesis so adult neurogenesis specifically development of new neurons and that there's a lot that's known about [3512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3512.27s)

specific neurotrophins mgf b d nf g d nf that support the development of nucleo cells neurons etc there are are things regarding the development of new neural stem cells and in the differentiation of the stem cells so we did a you know literature review of everything known in the space and then started looking at what the relationship between all the mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis [3534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3534.9s)

are and the evolutionary biology of why humans have as much neurogenic capacity as we have we're also doing structured review of everything on that how to remove senescent neurons so neural autophagy what is the senescence or mould neurons that are no longer functioning as well they're not serving us anymore and neural protection and new synaptic [3555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3555.3s)

development neurite developments and synaptogenesis as well as synaptic cleaving so all of these things are neural remodeling right brain remodeling so how does how do we get rid of old brain cells that are not functioning well and causing dysfunction develop new brain cells develop new connections between them develop new algorithms on them and so this is when we see the kind [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3576.15s)

of learning that can happen in early children that is not available in adults where adults learn a language and they keep an accent and children can learn multiple languages and not have an accent because the kind of neural restructuring neural plastic plasticity that's available we are very interested in being able to develop technologies to help advance the field of what's [3598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3598.8s)

possible for ongoing adult neural restructuring and this is for anti-aging specifically in the brain side and not just in terms of longevity and just neural health but also ongoing increased cognitive capacity that is fascinating we're definitely going to have to have another conversation about de brain just one hour straight about the brain now what [3621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3621.46s)

you look back on your journey has there been one point where you realized wow i learned one of the biggest lessons about my own personal wellness and it could have been at any stage in your life was there one or was there many where you thought you know what this really affected my wellness and i know how to take better steps next time so many rather than speak to one because so many [3639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3639.63s)

things in terms of how to take better responsibility for my relationships and almost every time that i ever thought there was a difficulty in a relationship that was someone else and learned how either it was actually me or the degree to which it was someone else i set up that dynamic or elicit it or didn't create enough discernment taking responsibility there and in physical [3660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3660.91s)

health and an emotional health and in finance in it you know if you want to look at something metta across all those it would be really profound empowered self responsibility but not just responsibility for my own well-being integrity and quality of life but also response rate for the way i impact what would you say to somebody who's experiencing anxiety i dealt with [3683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3683.109s)

anxiety a lot in my 20s to the point where i would not go out for days someone's feeling like that they're listening what are some things they can do in addition to to taking a smart nootropic or having a healthy regimen of exercise what else is something that people can do as a first or second step when they're going through kind of paralyzing anxiety well the first thing [3703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3703.089s)

i would say is i feel you i've been there i know how scary and crippling that can be one of the things that is trickiest about anxiety is we can feel anxiety about anything it can be a relationship ending or money or getting on stage or whatever and then if that anxiety ever gets to a high enough point that gets scary to us then we start any source of anxiety like normal stuff that [3731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3731.319s)

happens we become hypersensitive to our own sensations of anxiety then we become anxious about it and then we get in these feedback loops and so then we become scared of going to situations that we'll be scared of then we notice a little bit of fear and gosh is that thing going to happen again right and so panic attacks are where that just goes to zenith and then we can [3749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3749.869s)

get afraid well it's never gonna end i'm gonna be stuck in this forever which becomes the ultimate fear and then depression kicks in first thing i'd say is i've worked with a lot of people in panic attack disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and seen people shift from decades of these situations through different mechanisms and different modalities but it is addressable that's [3772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3772.249s)

the first thing i would say is it is addressable you need to find the right solutions they are not one right best solution for different people some people have got disorders and you can feel that you've got got disorders you address the gut disorder and the gut brain access optimising makes a tremendous difference there are other people where just addressing the [3792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3792.019s)

meditation side of it will make enough shift that they have the energy to start addressing other things other people there were there were those cognitive loops that are going on where they're afraid of their own symptom of fear cognitive behavioral therapy will actually address those cognitive loops quite quickly so there's different modalities that can be effective try [3810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3810.739s)

them like big responsibility for working at it and if some are not working then don't make a generalized assessment that nothing will work or nothing works for you or your anxieties particularly different or worse it's not just keep working at it what if someone just wants to increase emotional intelligence i mean what's made a difference for you from emotional intelligence how do we [3831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3831.559s)

grow that besides just making it a point to like connect like here we are we're connecting today and i made it a focus that was my intention before we sat down to connect but for somebody that's not in the regular practice of connecting or being present what does that look like in the first one or two or a handful of steps for them to be a more emotionally present practice allshare there are many [3850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3850.46s)

important ones but one simple extremely powerful one is practice looking at the world through other people's eyes really deeply so if you are upset with a partner or a friend or a family member step out of being you completely step out of your background your history or perspective and really try and be them and say with their history with the that they value of the ways they've been [3880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3880.369s)

hurt with et cetera and without knowing what your actual intentions were how you came across to them how they could have what what is it like white why are they feeling what they feel why are they asking for that are they upset are they and you know you've got it if you grok exactly why they are feeling the way they are and you're like wow i would totally be there too if you're like no [3901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3901.009s)

they're still lame i and my in their position i would such-and-such differently you haven't got it cuz you're not being them you're being you in their physical position without actually getting there in our experience a lot of the work that you do is is kind of serious in nature i mean you're solving some big problems here at neuro hacker but what do you do for fun and [3917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3917.809s)

what's something in your life that just cracks you up i mean with something that makes you laugh my wife makes me laugh consistently it is one of the great fortunes of my life so i'm very fortunate in that way i think everyone should pay attention to who they surround themselves with and have people that uplift them in various ways and also work to uplift everyone around you [3940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3940.249s)

so that you know people who are uplifting are engendered to want to do that so that's one thing key sure one thing that you might do that really cracks you up the most one of the reasons that we are together is very very balancing for me she's a extremely embodied playful person and so waking me up in the morning she's different characters and she's just basically [3961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3961.989s)

talking a different accent playing and entertaining me most of the time what can the wellness force community do to support you to get in this real conversation like they've been involved in today with us around doing things that matter to them on a fundamental and on a moral level but also taking care of their body what does that look like for them and how can we support neuro hacker [3982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=3982.369s)

three things that come to mind first is go to no hacker comm check it out read about it see if you are interested if the product that we currently have is interesting for you try it give us feedback if it is positive for you share it with people that's awesome it is a first product we have many more products this year that are coming out and then a lot of things are going to take more [4006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4006.759s)

years and a lot of research and development to be able to generate but our goal is ultimately developing everything that is most leveraged and meaningful for my brain optimization it's a huge task we need a lot of support in it and actually engaging with the current offerings as one of the things that helps us to grow so i would say check it out if it's [4025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4025.959s)

useful to you awesome if it is not a right fit for you product wise but you still are interested in what we're doing and just kind of follow the information awesome so that's one way another way is since our goals are ultimately you know we there's one meta imperative that we all share which is how do we optimize the quality of life for all life right we all share elements of that so [4050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4050.979s)

upregulate how you do your part of that and that helps synergistically with everything that we care about and that we're doing third thing i would say is if you are specifically interested in the future of human capacity human wellness psychiatry psychology biology and the extended future of civilization projects that were working on and you have resources that you'd like to add to [4075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4075.729s)

that whether its scientific capacities or specific business or organizational skills or resources of some kind contact us my last question for you is really profound because you have such a depth in your life you've come from a place where you're meditating as a kid and you've created so much and what you're doing neuro hacker i so connect with but with all that set i mean what is [4099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4099.25s)

wellness to you how would you define wellness in your life as we were mentioning earlier our direct personal experience is intrinsically valuable independent of anything that it affects right the universe is experiencing itself through our experience of it and so wellness is the depth and the choice and the profundity and the beauty of our experience that's part of it and what we [4124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4124.75s)

do that affects the experience of everyone else everything else is also fundamentally part of wellness of the whole that we are inextricably interconnected with so optimized human wellness is both depth of experience and depth of meaningful contribution capacity and orientation for meaningful contribution that was definitely the most unique answer i've [4149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4149.38s)

ever heard thank you so much for coming on the show i know that we're gonna have a ton of questions about this the links from today are gonna be a wellness force slash qualia you've also given us 10% off this incredible product so i know people gonna go and pick this up to not have it be the golden ticket but to have it support all those systems that can allow us to find whatever ticket we want [4166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4166.21s)

so thank you so much for coming on the show i really appreciate it thanks for having me this was fun and thanks for coming in for what you do for educating and supporting and empowering your community you've made it to the end of the episode and that is a great thing because i'm gonna share with you personally how much this interview and qualia have impacted me so far in 2017 i [4182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4182.74s)

also want to give you a few key takeaways from the show if you're listening on your phone just tap this show artwork and you'll be able to go right to wellness force comm forward slash qualia that is where we're gonna have all the links and downloads and the directions for your n equals one experiment with qualia in the show notes page if you just want to begin today you [4201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4201.13s)

can go directly to neuro hacker comm that is n e u roh ac ke r neuro hacker comm enter code w f10 and start the process it's no surprise that all human problems including stress and overwhelm and anxiety or disease are universal whether you live in san diego san antonio delaware or even france i think it's safe to say that our current industrialized society does not come [4226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4226.33s)

without a bombardment of notifications tasks and calendar appointments i think you can relate when i say that in 2016 especially i found myself becoming more of a slave to my phone than a master i even started to notice it with my friends where they'd be looking down at their phone as i was speaking to them and i know you know how that feels because it sucks when someone's not [4245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4245.2s)

fully present so beyond the cognitive effects i talked about on the show after taking qualia now for almost three months i can share with you that i just feel more present in the moment and that is something that can't always be quantified it can only be felt so if what we talked about on the show today inspired you to give it a shot in your own n equals one experiment head over to [4265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4265.45s)

the show notes page and give qualia a month test drive to see how your mind and body and emotional bandwidth will improve when you're done shoot me an email or even during the process message me josh at wellness force comm we know how the journey is unfolding be sure to use your discount code wf 10 that's wf 10 to save you a nice chunk of money on the qualia as well so the top [4287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4287.21s)

two takeaways from today's show the first one that hit me the most was from daniel where he mentioned a fully optimized human being will lead to a better world yes it's true if you're walking around stressed or with brain fog or overwhelmed it's gonna be more difficult to treat other people as you want them to treat you so by seeking your own optimization and empowering [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4306.139s)

your own wellness you're actually giving gifts to the people around you and next was curiosity i mentioned on the show how i've been insatiably curious for most of my life specifically with this podcast i think my curiosity drives all the questions where i dig so staying connected to that curiosity that fundamental spark in all of us from when you were a kid to this very [4326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4326.27s)

moment has been such a force of wellness in life so do not lose that curiosity spark the next time you're feeling curious about something dive in this is your sign so now there's one thing left to do when you turn off the episode and step into life and that is to go out and create an amazing day for you and the people you care about so until i see you again real soon i'm wishing you love and [4347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWfvO72vAw&t=4347.06s)

wellness
