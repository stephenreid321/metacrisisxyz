[[exponential tech]] is is really powerful it's like the power of gods at least little gods but we don't have the kind of wisdom love and prudence to use that power well and you don't get to keep doing exponential warfare and exponential externalities on a finite planet not blow yourself up music hello and welcome to the psychology [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=23.119s)

podcast in this episode i talked to social philosopher daniel schmucktenberger about exponential technology and its effects on our current world according to daniel organizations that harness the power of modern tech rarely use it for good like how [[social media]] companies boost polarizing content to maximize user engagement leading to a distrust of [42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=42.8s)

science and destabilized democracies to overcome humanity's current [[existential threat]] daniel argues we all need to work towards a radical [[cultural enlightenment]] we also touch on the topics of [[collective intelligence]] human development power responsibility and civilization it's always great chatting with daniel he's a good friend and very thoughtful human being so without [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=64.559s)

further ado i bring you daniel schmuckeberger hey daniel i can't wait to talk to you today on the psychology podcast i'm so happy to be talking to you again scott it's been a while it has been a while i love the beard i love the beard thank you you you've got a couple months to catch up i do a couple months but you look very wise [83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=83.52s)

and uh that will catch up with the fact you are wise you know you're a very wise human every as long as i've known you um i've been really impressed by your insights and your uh your um almost clairvoyance about the future of civilization which is pretty cool did did you always have that kind of um been being able to think not short term [103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=103.759s)

but very very long term about the the arc of humanity i think it's worth noting that i'm profoundly less good at that than i wish i was and also profoundly less good at it than i thought i was when i was younger oh that's fair enough it's it's an important thing to comment on but yeah i was fortunate uh i was [125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=125.119s)

homeschooled growing up and got to have a pretty unique curriculum largely self-guided curriculum but the things my parents were into so i was exposed um one of them was uh bucky fuller and so uh comprehensive anticipatory design science thinking through long arc of history long arc of future and how we design with that in mind was kind of [144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=144.8s)

early background and then a lot of frichoff capra and system science that was also doing kind of long-term forecasting and deep history so uh i would say long time scale has been uh with me most of my life well it's really uh allowed you to see and point out a lot of things going on in our world today that could be greatly [166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=166.4s)

greatly improved there's and there's a lot a lot that could be improved so let's take some slice of some of the things that have been on your mind lately i know one big thing is technology and the impact of technology on our psychology and the the risk of technology but i'm wondering to what extent you see the problem as do do you see it as [188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=188.239s)

an extreme extremely as bad as you know people are panicking you know there's a whole tech panic where are you in the spectrum from that too it is completely fundamentally um turning um kids into robots and uh causing them to be addicted and suicide rates et cetera first the other continuum there's a new book that just came out by uh robbie suave i don't know [208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=208.4s)

if you heard about it call it i think it's actually called tech panic where he says everybody calm down there's really nothing to worry here um all the liberals are panicking for nothing um where do you kind of fall in this large broad spectrum yeah there's um there are naive techno optimists and [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=228.159s)

naive techno pessimist views the naive techno pessimist view sees the problems that are associated with tech and takes a luddite direction and that approach will always just lose because it will have less power than whatever group is embracing the tech which has the power so [247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=247.04s)

really there are no futures that have any chance that aren't higher tech because even if they were better they would just lose and so from a real politic assessment specifically now [[exponential tech]] is so much more powerful than every other form of legacy power that only the groups that are developing and deploying [[exponential tech]] will have any say in the future wait can you actually define what [[exponential tech]] is yeah there's a number of different ways we could define it uh tech that has exponentially more influence or power with uh or exponentially less people need to be involved exponentially less resource [283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=283.44s)

time scale so formally [[exponential tech]] would mean technology that recursively makes itself better so if you think about computation i can use a computer to simulate how to make a better computer chip get better transistor density and then that better computer chip can do better simulations to make a better computer chip i can use [301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=301.759s)

ai to make better ai but not just formally that there are kinds of tech that help advance a [[world system]] where that [[world system]] as a whole makes better tech right nukes don't necessarily make better nukes but they definitely concentrate power to where the groups that have them can do more tech investments including in nukes um so i wouldn't call it an [[exponential tech]] formally in terms of self-recursion but um so there's there's a range of definitions if we mostly we're talking about when we say exponential type we're talking about computation and its derivatives that do recursively affect themselves but you also have things like [340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=340.08s)

you have a a product for sale a good or service that doesn't have atoms involved so there's no unit cost so i make the thing once and then sell it an indefinite number of times with with no you know so it's all margin so i get an exponential return on capital as a result this is why pretty much all the unicorns are software companies [359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=359.199s)

and um music all of the capital flows into software which is from hardware or so much of it has which is why silicon valley has been largely software but [[exponential tech]] also means if you look at the time scale that it took for facebook to reach a billion people compared to say anything [378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=378.16s)

else historically the first oil company or whatever so the speed to scale or that facebook has three billion users on a monthly basis so the total scale or the um amount of scale those [[social media]] companies have ai models be the predictor behavior better than [399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=399.12s)

intelligence companies have on their own populations um also it takes way less people to run one of those companies or that or that technology and so by [[exponential tech]] we mean all of the roughly all of those things where there is some kinds of either the return on [416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=416.8s)

capital the tech making the tech better um basically increase scale of impact from smaller groups and shorter periods of time okay cool so yeah so where do you see that uh yeah so the center of that is computation the very center of that is ai and then computation and ai working on computational substrate like how to make quantum computers and photic computers and better gpus and all like that's the next step then all the sensors that go into it the whole internet of things world and the ar vr kind of extensions then computation and ai applied to [457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=457.199s)

nanotech biotech protein folding the rest of the world right so that's kind of the way of thinking about it i would say that [[exponential tech]] provides so much more power than everything else that it just wins via economic warfare political information [476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=476.4s)

warfare whatever you want to call it competitive dynamics and so if you're if there's a group that has got a vision for how to make a better future but it doesn't have the power to enact it it's not going to matter and the power to enact it is going to come through the size of the lever that is affecting the [493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=493.759s)

choices which is going to be the tech and so right now i would say there are only a few types of groups that are really developing and deploying [[exponential tech]] which means they are the types of groups that have the most influence on shaping the future currently and none of them are thinking about the types of things that matter for the types of future we [515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=515.039s)

want adequately okay let's pause there you're saying so much that uh is rich i assume facebook is one of those that you are referring to and do you think they have been rightly criticized along those lines for not fully realizing the their potential that they could have or the kind of power they could have totally yeah okay i didn't answer your initial question i started to go off [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=537.76s)

another direction around uh the techno optimist or techno pessimist direction uh nobody wants to go back to a pre-technology time where novocaine didn't exist and you still need dental work right like there's lots of things about tech that we like but all the tech also corresponds with [554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=554.959s)

externalities of harms across environmental [[supply chain|supply chains]] or social dynamics or whatever it is um so is the world getting better from attack like pinker and rosling and people would say or is it getting worse like so many environmentalists and stanford humane technology and other places would say it's getting better and [574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=574.0s)

worse at the same time on different metrics that's the most nuanced answer i've ever heard in the history of answers i love that yeah it's getting better associated with the metrics that we're measuring and optimizing for in particular that have capital associated and it's getting worse on all the other metrics it's getting worse on heaps of psychological metrics related to this podcast where we were just talking earlier that there are so many psychiatric disorders that where people don't have a full blown diagnosable version of it they have a subclinical version of generalized anxiety disorder or of borderline type dynamics or of addictive tendencies or [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=613.2s)

of um existential angst and nihilism or but like ubiquitous psychopathology is one of the externalities of all of our tech and success do you mean do you mean is it a consequence or is it um there's obviously a bi-directional loop there right there's a bi-directional [633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=633.12s)

loop music the the drug dealer says hey i'm just supplying a thing that the people want uh but when they offer the first hit for free to get the people to want it starting when their kids are in bad environments where they you know don't really understand the full [651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=651.92s)

consequence and then offer it to people who are already addicted there is a there's a supply-side responsibility missing especially given the asymmetric capacity of the supply side relative to the demand side that then gets to have this [[plausible deniability]] called i'm just supplying the existing demand [668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=668.16s)

but it's manufacturing demand that is not actually healthy and it is manufacturable because of the asymmetry of supply so once companies start getting big enough to make people want that they never had before in fact make them feel unhappy if they don't have the that they never had before make designed and obsolescence and style changes that [685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=685.279s)

make them continue to need the new and then say look we're just giving the people what they want there's something basically rather than authentic demand for real things driving supply of real value you start to have supply wanting to continue to concentrate its power driving demand to then be able to have the [[plausible deniability]] of saying it's all voluntary but it's appealing to the lower angels of our nature rather than the higher angels of our nature and when you start to get such radical asymmetries as multi-billion dollar or trillion dollar companies that are coordinated and the demand side is not coordinated there isn't there aren't like labor unions of all of demand that go up against google that are also using the same kind of [724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=724.0s)

ai's it's the individual google user against google and google's using the most advanced ais in the world with like a trillion dollar market cap against an individual person who doesn't even know that their data is being harvested to optimize their behavior to sell to somebody then um the whole idea of market and the [740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=740.0s)

rationality of the market is very broken and so then if you want to maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer addiction is a great way to maximize lifetime revenue of customer and then if you're something like facebook or google where you're an advertiser where maximizing addiction across every different [757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=757.92s)

avenue possible right i get like i'm making money by maximizing their attention and so then i can sell their behavior to all of the different industries um that's kind of a meta play on addiction hey this is so rich so let's take a pause here a second [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=778.56s)

music hey everyone i'm excited to announce that the eight eight-week online transcend course is back become certified in learning the latest science of human potential and learn how to live a more fulfilling meaningful creative and self-actualized life the course starts march 13th of this year and goes until may 1st the course includes more [798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=798.8s)

than 10 hours of recorded lectures four live group q a sessions with me four small group sessions with our world-class faculty a plethora of resources and articles to support your learning and an exclusive workbook of growth challenges that we think will help you overcome your deepest fears and grow as a whole person there are even some personalized self-actualization [819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=819.36s)

coaching spots with me available as an add-on save your spot today by going to transcendcourse.com that's transcendcourse.com we have so much fun in this course and i look forward to welcoming you to be a part of the transcender community okay now back to the show let's uh elucidate and or delineate exactly what we mean by the lower angels and what we mean by the [841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=841.519s)

higher angels i think that would be useful in this conversation now when i my head immediately starts to go to when you say lower angels i think ego i think self-esteem drive you know i think from a maslow perspective right i think about what needs are being met when i think lower i think basic needs versus higher needs which are more growth oriented needs and i just wanted to see if you're [861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=861.279s)

on the same page are we are we thinking along some more lines here i'll say it a different way okay so if i'm looking at what is the like what is fast food as a phenomena what is hostess and mcdonald's as a phenomenon because it's providing base level needs survival needs in the same way [880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=880.639s)

that food from your garden would provide them so it's not that we're talking about um base needs versus higher needs we're talking about even here based needs versus base needs but that are different in kind okay good good this is great so it'd be the distinction that i make between like healthy self-esteem versus unhealthy self-esteem unhealthy [899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=899.279s)

self-esteem big narcissism and healthy self-esteem being a sense of self-worth and competence so yes is actually anti-narcissistic right it has correct in order to truly be healthy it's acutely aware of all the things that it's not good at and it doesn't have its [917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=917.76s)

sense of self worth or lovability coupled to that so it doesn't have to be in competition with everyone all the time it wants to see a healthy world so it wants to see other people succeeding right its own success doesn't get made less by other people's success um so healthy self-esteem and narcissism aren't like slightly similar versions they're almost [937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=937.759s)

almost antithetical in really deep ways to each other right they are but yes and and by healthy and unhealthy i mean in terms of they're both attempts to regulate that need for self-esteem but one does it in a very unhealthy detrimental way that's not leading to growth and one way is actually caring about uh growth even at the expense of an ego being hurt or something along [959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=959.44s)

those lines yeah okay so how we define the healthy versus unhealthy super important i want to drop back down below a steam to survival again and go back to the fast food example because it's a particularly clear one and then we'll we can go all the way up so in an [[evolutionary environment]] for humans there wasn't a lot of abundant sugar floating around you could get a few fruits and a few times a year not that many fruit trees weren't like they are now that they've been hybridized and there was so much kind of caloric surplus in the fruit in the place where famine was a real thing and most people died from feminine that there was a dopaminergic response [993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=993.68s)

associated with sugar and the sweet taste because those who got more of it survived better right and the same is true with fat and the same is through assault those were all hard things in in [[evolutionary environment|evolutionary environments]] again so given that they were scarce and they were evolutionarily adaptive we have a strong feels good do it again response right a [[reward circuit]] associated with salt fat and sugar industrialization came along we were able to extract salt and fat and sugar from the micro nutrients that they were a part of make abundant amounts of them and then recombine salt fat sugar in lots of different ways as a frappuccino as a milkshake as french fries it's all just salt fat sugar with different types of flavor and palatability [1031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1031.12s)

to maximize the dopaminergic response so then we have in the rather than uh starvation being the leading cause of death obesity being one of the leading causes of death and obesity related uh issues in the west in the developed world and so what we can see that we did is we extracted the reward part from what it was supposed to be coupled to it was [1052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1052.24s)

supposed to be coupled to vitamins and protein and minerals and the micronutrients and the and scarcity of resource so having some abundance where it was actually needed now we have excessive amounts but the [[reward circuit]] hasn't evolutionarily changed right so it's a it's a up [[reward circuit]] and what i would say fast food is to real nutrition where you decoupled the reward from what it should be rewarding decoupled it from an actual evolutionary benefit that's what porn is to sexuality it's what [[social media]] is to real social relationships um it's what online shopping is relative to the [1092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1092.799s)

like exp uh evolutionary impulse to uh explore and find relevant new things novelty searching i would push back on one of the things you said uh for the sake of conversation i think that [[social media]] can form real social relationships i think there's a certain it that doesn't tend [1115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1115.84s)

to and i and we see a lot of unhealthy aspects of it but i think you know a lot of people who have difficulty communicating with each other outside of online have found really strong communities like people in the autism community for instance and things that have formed real deep relationships so i would make the case that that analogy's not 100 correct [1134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1134.799s)

because you you know [[social media]] can afford real social relationships but it just doesn't tend to be the case well okay so it's a great example autism community being an actual community online because even without leaving their house and going into social environments that are awkward they can find people and talk to them so there's this issue of uh way too many men in china because of the one child policy for a long time and it's selected for men and so you have a bunch of unmarriable men something like maybe 100 million of them and that's a pretty big deal because whenever a society gets too many men if the men can't get laid they decide to [1175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1175.84s)

blow the society up um and so you have to usually start a land war to get rid of some of the men and usually advance the aims of the society like that's kind of a well-known phenomena and so but in modern time what do we do with it so one of the things that has been happening is a lot of these men falling in love with an ai [1195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1195.679s)

chatbot and you can imagine a world where vr porn with ai chatbot type features deals with issues like that and you're like hey and porn did a good thing um it's not that it can't ever do a good thing it's that overall it is oriented in a way that has [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] that are decoupled from the thing they evolved to enhance right overarchingly that's the phenomena we're looking at is that someone is getting a reward process for something that is not net healthy or evolutionary for them or their role in society and [1233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1233.44s)

so i would say at every level of maslow's hierarchy there are going to be places where i can get a [[reward circuit]] that makes me keep doing the thing but that the thing that i'm doing is not net developmental and a meaningful definition of development versus making sure that my [[reward circuit]] is actually coupled to real development so an interesting thing about uh [1250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1250.88s)

the maslow hierarchy in in my revised hierarchy is that i don't actually treat his levels but as different uh uh i guess uh forms of integration so that's why i changed it from like a hierarchical uh triangle to a pyramid to a sailboat an integrated whole unit and i know we we've had some real i remember have a conversation i don't know do you [1273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1273.36s)

remember we had a conversation in your car your car once after a long walk and we talked about integration in anthony and steven so this is a so there are two things that that both of us have been super interested in since we've known each other integration and emergence and i'm wondering how they come into play here right because to me it seems like [1292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1292.72s)

healthy um healthy use of [[social media]] is a possibility but it actually takes um it takes a lot more integration then uh then a lot of people have the patience to you know it's a it's a lot quicker to have this kind of disintegration on [[social media]] and you see it disintegrates quickly so anyway i just wanted to riff on that and get your thoughts now yeah it's actually very interesting because so you say it this it disintegrates quickly and one of the classic examples that we see is the amount of polarization that occurs in [[social media]] whether we're talking about social justice or vaccines or [[climate change]] or gay marriage or whatever and um so this is an example of where the technology is being developed in an in a landscape where the economic shaped it so heavily right [1348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1348.72s)

it they didn't want to charge the users so the users aren't the customers the advertisers are so selling the user behavior is the product and so gathering behavior on the user get gathering behavioral data on them to be able to sell it and that that should actually be a breach of fiduciary uh law except it doesn't apply because [1369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1369.919s)

when it was developed this type of thing didn't exist because it's facebook is gathering an amount of information on you from a predictive behavioral analytic point of view that should be considered privileged information they can predict your behavior in consequential ways more than your psychotherapist or your lawyer or whoever else could that has a fiduciary [1387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1387.36s)

responsibility to only use that information in your interest but here they're selling it to other people uh political actors and corporate actors that don't they want you to do a behavior that's aligned with their interests and so there's a real problem with that but you can see that like if facebook simply charged you for a [1405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1405.2s)

service and let you calibrate what it was optimizing for and had a fiduciary responsibility to you in order to have access to that much of your behavioral data it would be totally different but because they're selling ads they want to maximize your time on site and your engagement and it happens to be that the things that are more addictive [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1424.4s)

maximize time on site and the things that are more polarizing maximize engagement so when you train the ai on maximize time on site maximize engagement and it's just running personal analytics at a scale nobody could possibly make sense of the most polarizing and the most limbically hijacking is what [1442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1442.88s)

emerges and the lower angels of our nature again meaning it's easier to get the dopamine hit from the fast food than it is to get the better feelings from the eating salad and veggies and exercising which is going to take me months to feel better that like oh wow i actually have less inflammation in my body and i can [1461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1461.2s)

move and i feel better about things there's a two marshmallow delayed gratification thing and uh so it's the broken [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] are just faster you can appeal to them easier so capitalism appeals to the lower angels of our nature better than the higher angels of our nature right because the higher angels of our nature [1480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1480.48s)

don't need to buy an extrinsic thing to to get happiness and they don't um and they don't make immediate actions as quickly based on some kind of impulsivity so uh the the marketing is going to appeal to impulse control disorders and pushing pain points to then offer market-based solutions yeah [1499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1499.679s)

and then being able to ai optimize this ad over this ad from this company over this company just creates an [[arms race]] of maximizing addictiveness writ large everywhere well you nailed it that is what's happening um you know the psychological concept time preference seems relevant here um and it's just very interesting because all the things we know about you know in the [1521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1521.12s)

self-control literature the self-development literature all the things we know that if we have long-term goals and and strategies we use to curb those long-term goals i mean [[social media]] they're not designing things to bring out the best long-term in people it's but they could the point that i think the point is and this is where we're getting this is we need a [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1540.32s)

different business model yeah yeah and and so i really want to have that conversation with you too what could this new business model look what is positive product design is my colleague courtney bigany i was doing great work on designs and as you are and your colleagues um what would the new algorithm look like um i believe the colleague that [1559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1559.52s)

introduced us was zack stein and uh that's right some of the early work he did was a uh uh work on development like following the piaget kind of work of stage of childhood development past 18 as an assumption that that's when humans stop meaningfully developing and continuing [1578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1578.48s)

to ask what does a developed human being in a mean in a meaningful sense ongoingly how do we assess that how do we create education for it how do we personalize education for it and so the group lectica built this thing called electrical score one of the things that they were looking at they're [1596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1596.72s)

like this this is a good characteristic of development writ large is someone's orientation to seek multiple perspectives right now in a complex scenario recognize that each perspective will have some signal not be pure noise but every perspective will probably have some noise in it so let me seek as many [1615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1615.6s)

perspectives as possible the first parts perspective seeking and perspective taking next part would be the ability to parse those perspectives to try to find the signal and get rid of the noise and then do synthesis and so the complexity to be able to take many perspectives to parse them to bring them together and yet still hold enough [1634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1634.799s)

uncertainty to continue to evolve that that would be a thing we would like to develop in people right um so let's say we could automate electrical assessment of people based on their online behavior and let's say that we train facebook's algorithm to increase people's lexical [1653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1653.679s)

score so it was going to put in front of them music uh and let's let's make it simpler we want to increase people's attention span rather than decrease it and we want to increase their non-dopaminergic attention so we don't just increase their attention span by giving them [1672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1672.08s)

like only more animated videos that they can make it through longer but like increase their attention span with text right with some boring um which means and it's actually really important why right um it's important that there if there is to be any volition or self-determination of the being that they're able to engage [1690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1690.159s)

their attention in a self-directed way for enough time to be able to actually get enough information to process the complexity of a thing so let's say that facebook said all right we only we want to increase everyone's attention span we want to increase their intentionality rather than their distractions so we're gonna [1708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1708.32s)

do continual check-ins on the nature of their intentionality i have some friends that just sent me a thing on that they're working on developing some technology to do attention and intention up regulation um you know you can see a lot of things that we could assess that we would add to the objective function that we wanted [1727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1727.2s)

to optimize for that would be net positive and and i don't have to say hey we're because everyone would have a concern well is the right gonna have a control on this is the left gonna have a control on this if you're perspective seeking uh then it doesn't matter we're not trying to make people have one view [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1744.96s)

more we're trying to make people better at seeking the range of views being able to understand them being able to articulate them in more nuanced ways but daniel this is the truth this is the tricky thing because the lower angel the most immediate short-term response is the one that's partisan is the one that's tied to your own identity so this i'm just pointing this out to [1765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1765.76s)

our audience yeah that's a kind of mcdonald's it's a kind of heroine it's a kind of porn right tribal identity in politics is to real political thinking what porn is to real intimate relationships well i'll speak for yourself and i'll tell you guys so what i mean is it's a way to get [1787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1787.52s)

the dopaminergic hit of certainty and sanctimony and righteousness and group identity without possibly advancing a functional thing okay think about this if our so many people in the u.s whether our issue is social justice or our issue is vaccines our greatest enemy is our fellow countrymen right the rights antipathy of the left the left's antipathy of the right is so intense that our fellow countrymen are our greatest enemies we put most of our our energy into infighting there well what happens to that nation that nation breaks down pretty fast well china's belt and road initiative [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1829.52s)

becomes the new 21st century global power structure because they don't create a system of internal antipathy um and if we put all this energy into political infighting every four years to get someone elected who will not be able to focus on anything that will take four [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1847.52s)

years or longer and all infrastructure and everything takes four years or longer so they'll only be able to focus on super short-term and whatever they do will get undone in the next four years and whatever new technology of being able to engage the people and get them out to vote or change their minds that we figure out how to use the other side [1863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1863.36s)

if we're effective we'll reverse engineer make a better version so we just drive [[arms race|arms races]] on that that's just a path to self-termination you cannot possibly run a democracy effectively where your fellow countrymen are your enemy and where your all of the energy turns into waste heat because of infighting [1881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1881.84s)

so all that does is select out democracy and have uh technologically empowered authoritarianism guaranteed to rule the world and so if you are busy doing left-right infighting you're also just busy killing [[open society|open societies]] completely and voting for digital author or technologically empowered autocracy [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1903.84s)

running the world your little issue that you're focused on is a much littler issue than do we have a process to address issues at all that is aligned with the kind of society we would like to have that's exactly what we're talking about right now so how can the default response be perspective taking that's my question oh this is how we come to the the one marshmallow versus two marshmallow politics is there is a dopaminergic hit uncertainty music because think about it in an [[evolutionary environment]] right in a tribal type environment [1941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1941.12s)

having enough having clarity certainty to know how to act had value do i is are there dangerous predators over there is there a tribe that we're gonna have to deal with is there food to go pursue like there's value in the certainty and it was fairly straightforward to get it for those types of things because you just go look and you could poke it with a stick and have direct five cents [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1962.159s)

experience of the thing and someone else could come out five cents experience of the same thing right so there was but now almost all the things we're certain of nobody can poke with a stick nobody's seen nobody really has a sense what the ccp is doing or what happened in the wuhan virology institute or if the mrna really such and such or no idea but totally [1981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1981.279s)

certain everyone thinks they're certain they know though yeah and so there's an ev like it feels good to be certain there's a certain good feeling of righteousness and kind of moral sanctimony and there's a certain good [1998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=1998.08s)

feeling of feeling like i'm with the other ones who are right music but all of that is the good feeling of eating mcdonald's right it's a dopaminergic hit that is artificially giving a neurotransmitter to your brain that is decoupled from the actual thing that neurotransmitter would have evolutionarily signaled for [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2020.399s)

and so it feels good but is actually making you dumber and better while you're thinking that you are smarter and gooder right thinking that you are more doing the true and good thing yeah if we would get really nerdy here um there are multiple dopamine pathways and i've written articles about more evolved opening pathways that send [2041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2041.6s)

projections to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which is what we want to engage more when we're talking about your kind of way of perspective taking and um holding consciousness and being able to inhibit the the pre-potent response that's all executive functions which do have dopamine projections but they're more later evolved so they're not as default default i don't know i [2062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2062.399s)

said like that they're not as default um but i've written about i've called it the nerdy dopamine pathway is what i've called it so we need we need to activate more of the nerdy dopamine pathway i think you would agree yeah okay so this is very interesting you come back to um music polarization and we come back to the topic of democracy for a moment so uh democracies modern democracies emerged following the [[printing press]] because the [[printing press]] meant textbooks and newspaper for everyone so you don't need a privileged nobility class that has access to education and information everybody can get educated and everybody can know what's going on [2096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2096.879s)

so that they can all participate in government the [[social media]] is really an anti-[[fourth estate]] and the exact opposite of a [[printing press]] because rather than everyone being able to get a newspaper to have uh the same information about [[base reality]] to make decisions on here we're going to customize a news feed to my preferences [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2112.16s)

so two people will have certainty because there's an ubiquity of information that was customized to my likelihood to believe it and interact with it but they're seeing completely different worlds and so and what it's and yet that makes me engage more seeing the things that hit my preference biases [2132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2132.4s)

and so you have ai more powerful than the ad that beat casprava chess optimizing everyone towards doubling down on their own biases group identities limit hijacks and bias for certainty so democracy breaks with that you get an increasingly polarized population which [2151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2151.04s)

creates an increasingly polarized representative class which has more and more gridlock which can't get done which just loses to authoritarianism and especially technologically empowered authoritarianism that without the gridlock inside can implement [[exponential tech]] towards long-term visions so when we come back to the [[printing press]] thing it's not just that democracy emerged when we had broadcast and the ability to get the same message out to everyone it's that reading was actually an important part of it this was something that marshall mcluhan discussed and um music the guys at the digital life foundation [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2184.16s)

go into quite a lot is uh at the time of say the the development of this country and a lot of the political thinking associated there's very little [[hypernormal stimuli]] in reading plain text on paper and you have to actually stay focused for a fairly long period of time without distractions to get the content in so you're actually training attention span like a muscle and obviously to engage in democracy i've got to be able to hold my view and someone else's view in someone else's view at the same time right the complexity of the situation means i need more working memory to hold the whole thing if my work memory and attention span comes too small i can only be a fundamentalist who has reactionary views that can fit into sound bites um because the truth is to fit into a sound byte so you have to have much longer attention spans which means you have to train attention span [2238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2238.96s)

which means rather than fast cycles of of low dopaminergic stuff i need stuff like reading it's boring as and then also writing right when the medium was reading and writing writing also means i had to be able to understand what i thought well enough to articulate it in structured form and so i'm not saying we go to a [2258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2258.32s)

pre-digital age we're not going to but we have to look at the things that cognitive capacities that those media were developing in us and say in this new media age how do we develop those same cognitive capacities and if not what does that portend for our [[social structure|social structures]] yes and you'll play improv here with you um yes and the [2278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2278.96s)

dopamine pathway that goes to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is correlated with the personality trait openness to experience so there are individual differences in this and there are some people who do find greater reward value of information of learning new information so you know knowing that how can we kind of for those that are very low on that [2301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2301.68s)

personality trait spectrum where they're not getting uh reward value from information they gain more reward value from um more of the pro primal dopamine pathways sex drugs rock and roll you know how do we kind of increase that motivation in everyone because that's i mean this obviously the million dollar question first thing is that you can [2324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2324.72s)

be aware of what increases the opposite of it in people and start looking at how do we deal with that we can't have multi-billion person networks with multi-trillion dollar market caps using ai and personalization to make people oriented to certainty even more aggressively angrily righteously certain right like if you're doing that thing [2351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2351.2s)

you're not just saying how do we it's not just can we develop everyone more it's look we're actually the thing up pretty badly so that's one thing to look at the other thing is like okay are those differences genetic are they early childhood are they even in utero what was going on in the neural chemistry of the mom that was affecting [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2370.16s)

the receptor cybermansions who the knows i i think it's very complex and every piece of science looks at the thing it's looking at and then over indexes how important that thing was um but i think it's a complex function of a lot of those things but you look at across cultures where you have a you're going to have a distribution of different genetic predispositions and typologies yet where you still get the bell curve moved one way or the other for the culture as a whole which is indicating the way enculturation works and so you look at buddhists and you and their orientation regarding violence across age groups and whatever and you're like are the buddhists less violent [2409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2409.119s)

historically across the last 3000 years 10 million people varying plus or minus wartime peacetime famine whatever yes they're just less violent can you attribute that to genes no it's lots of different gene groups and some people with the same genes who are not buddhists but are hindus or muslims or whatever else are more violent in other situations like in culturing people [2427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2427.44s)

to compassion for all sentient beings as the core thing from early childhood with all of the practices like it actually works if you look at jews and you're like do jews develop a higher degree of education across the bell curve for their people regardless of the embedding environment they're in they do they do a pretty good [2447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2447.359s)

job of that historically across a couple thousand years at least and so there's something in the culture of what the [[value system|value systems]] are and how they embed the [[value system|value systems]] that have to do with the nature you know does the sabbath have something to do with making sure that tech isn't running your life too much because you have a [2465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2465.04s)

break from its effect on your life um where you're also communing with the sacred and the sense of what how should my life be directed you know like that itself would be a social technology that's very interesting to be able to bind a culture and increase its power to steward physical technology well um so can we develop everyone can we prevent people from being developed in the worst ways yes can we develop people in progressively better ways as whole cultures independent of individual disposition yes should everyone be equally good at all things no because the person who might have less [[reward circuit]] on complex cognitive abstract thought might be a brilliant musician and so great we society wants lots of different kinds of things right yes so far as it starts to have to do with uh governance now we have this big question this is [2526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2526.72s)

why do we want to direct democracy where everyone votes on everything or where they just vote on representatives a lot of the arguments against direct democracy we're like do you really want these people voting on everything um or do you at least want them to vote on a representative class that has some training in law and politics and stuff to not do super dumb stuff [2544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2544.48s)

we can do better than that now we can do things like a [[liquid democracy]] where rather than pick one representative to represent me across all things who now how like okay so this person is supposed to have a say on defense issues and technology issues and monetary issues and international policy and domestic we're like what the who has that expertise [2567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2567.68s)

so what if we have a [[liquid democracy]] situation where we have say a digital democratic platform i get to engage in the topics and on the topics where i don't understand them well i can cede my vote to someone who does that i think understands it well in that topic but the guy who i really trust in what we should do with the energy grid might be [2583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2583.76s)

totally different than who i trust and what i think we should do with monetary policy now what if we can go a step further and do something like qualified platforms where you bind rights and responsibilities this starts to sound really tricky but when you think about what all the alternatives are what's scary about this is not more scary it's less scary than what's scarier about all the other options so binding rights and responsibilities do you mean integrate them what do you have by binding uh if i have a right without an attendant responsibility we end up getting um entitlement [2621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2621.119s)

dynamics yeah if i have a responsibility without a right we get enslavement dynamics and so the binding of if i want more rights in the system there are more responsibilities because if i have the right to influence the system in a certain way but somebody's going to be responsible to implement that but i don't have any [2638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2638.96s)

responsibility in it i'll always vote myself benefits that i don't want to take responsibility for paying the cost of right yeah so there's something around the more responsibility we can take the more right we have to influence the thing it's a meritocratic kind of idea there's of course problems with it we could get into this in a more nuanced [2656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2656.16s)

time where we have more nuance for it but let's just imagine for a moment that we had a a digital engagement kind of democratic platform like where i could uh help craft individual propositions so i didn't just have to vote yes or no in a bundled proposition where both suck yes sucks and no sucks based on what's bundled into it and where the structure [2677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2677.2s)

of that forces the polarization of the population just based on even those who are voting yes or are causing harm to the people who are connected to whatever it harms so we can actually do proposition creation in this process but let's say there's a thing where if i want to engage in this topic there's a very basic test that i take that shows that i [2696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2696.0s)

understand this kind of general pros and cons of the proposition or basic facts of the issue it doesn't mean i have to agree with them it just means that i understand some basic things and then i get engaged if i don't i still have a vote that i can proxy to someone who has through a [[liquid democracy]] but rather than vote for a representative across the board it can be someone who i think is good on that topic but i can also choose to get more educated about that topic and the platform will educate me in audio or video or text if so if i'm blind or whatever and in any language i want and it's free right so i have the capacity to get more educated but should everyone who has no idea at all really have a say in what our energy grid stability policy against emps and carrington events be like i don't want that i want people who understand who at least have some sense of understanding the basic things so they weren't controlled by a manipulative populism [2752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2752.8s)

to engage in it and if someone else that they know does have that basic understanding and they want to liquidly put it across great so now you have this issue where someone is like i want to make great music i trust these people in these areas i don't care to know that much but i'm also now you don't have the populist [2773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2773.2s)

incentive to have a demagogue leader try to get all of those people to believe nonsense so that they can go vote in a particular nonsense direction i mean look i agree with this theory but i want to keep going back to well what how can these big tech companies use this information to help redesign civilization what we're talking about [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2793.44s)

right now would be more something like how could the governments of the world build the next phase of government where we actually had to build a lot of infrastructure for this government town halls where the people could meet and talk through the thing and courts where the judiciary process could happen and a mail system so the information could be shipped around it's [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2812.48s)

just that's a super old system it is not technologically relevant and so now we have like e-services so you can log on to dmv and do some basic but the structure of government how it processes information has not evolved to process the kind of information issues that we have in a way that it could taiwan is the [2833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2833.28s)

best example so far of a [[open society]] or a democratic country actually building a democratic platform where people can engage in fundamentally different ways in the previous system because you couldn't fit everyone in a town hall there was no way but you could fit everyone into an internet platform that could [2851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2851.119s)

contribute to in constructive ways to the creation of the right propositions and they're they're doing a brilliant job with that we wrote a paper overviewing the uh the way taiwan transitioned to digital democracy on the consilience project if people want to check it out audrey tang helped lead that work um it's so and it's kind of important to realize that the nuclear bomb as a massive advancement in tech the first existential tech ever was not created by the market it was created by the state and the recognition that there was an [[existential risk]] if it didn't create it it created an indefinite budget right black budget to bring all the top scientists together to build the [2891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2891.359s)

tech that the world that the country needed we could do a manhattan project to take the ai and [[blockchain]] and all of the types of digital technology to build the next phase of [[open society]] recognizing that [[open society|open societies]] are being eroded and are almost totally gone and they're being eroded by the same tech because the tech [2910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2910.48s)

is making corporations exponentially more powerful that are actually eroding democracy in the way that we have mentioned and are unable to be regulated by the democracy because they're getting more powerful than it and authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] can implement the technology to make more powerful authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] if [[open society|open societies]] don't innovate and how to use that tech because the thing we said at the beginning is only the groups are developing and deploying [[exponential tech]] we'll have a say in the future because that's where the power is and yet none of the groups that are doing that are democratic or even have a [2942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2942.16s)

democratic ideal they're whether it's a tech company or an uh authoritarian [[nation state]] they're top-down systems so there is no bottom-up jurisprudence and so i want to see [[open society|open societies]] take on the role of innovating not one type of tech but the whole suite of digital tech to make better [[open society|open societies]] because i don't see that [[open society]] survive otherwise okay so let's talk about the consilience project a little bit uh so how are you doing that now you also are partnering with tristan harris on some stuff right from the social dilemma movie he was featured in there uh can you talk a little bit about that yeah the social dilemma probably many people have seen that if they haven't it's worth checking out and it just [2982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=2982.72s)

overviews a lot of the uh issues and harms that the attention economy technologies create tristan's a lead in that runs a group called the center for humane technology and so yeah we're good friends and colleagues and um [3001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3001.359s)

worked uh with talking with a lot of people in the u.s government and other governments on how to address some of these issues and some with tech companies and some with just general [[public education]] the consensus project is trying to put out content that will help people understand the deeper issues addressing the state of the world uh so that they can more competently make sense of what is going on beyond what they would get through their news feed or other sources so that also they can [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3040.4s)

the kind of [[collective intelligence]] of the world can be better applied to innovate the things that matter we are about to do a series of uh 10 new papers that just centrally describe what we would consider the [[metacrisis]] [[climate change]] and the issues associated with uh ai risk and tech and um all the [[planetary boundary]] issues like they're actually all instantiations of a kind of broken civilization system how do you understand what's wrong with the civilization system and what is needed to be stewards of the power of [[exponential tech]] kind of mythopoetically you can say [3081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3081.04s)

[[exponential tech]] is is really powerful it's like the power of gods at least little gods but we don't have the kind of wisdom love and prudence to use that power well and you don't get to keep doing exponential warfare and exponential externalities on a finite planet not blow yourself up so what do we need in terms of a culture [3101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3101.76s)

that is producing the love and wisdom and the new [[social system|social systems]] made by that culture that have the ability to utilize the tech but also bind guide and direct it to fully healthy for the people and the planet directions not the extractive harm-causing ones so we're writing that series and then um other things to music try and work on uh having more people understand a bigger picture of what's going on so that there are more people capable of problem solving in meaningful ways well i hope this podcast chat goes along with those lines [3141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3141.2s)

you're not against exponential technologies you're against increasingly decentralized exponential technologies not about decentralized um uh honestly what you see with facebook is a radical centralization of power right you have you have one [[social media]] company that is radically more powerful than all the [3161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3161.76s)

other ones and really has a monopoly of attention facebook i mean google is that to search engines amazon is that to online stores there's a way that [[network dynamics]] started creating natural monopolies that weren't governed by previous anti-trust type dynamics and that's actually an example of how [[exponential tech]] leads to centralization in very harmful ways but in other ways [3183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3183.839s)

decentralized exponential technologies are just bad so [[exponential tech]] both radically centralizes and decentralizes power both in problematic ways the decentralized power is the ability for a small group of people to do cyber [3203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3203.28s)

attacks on infrastructure that can actually shut whole infrastructure down the ability to over the next little while be able to build drone weapons and ai weapons and bio weapons by tiny little non-state actors that have catastrophic ability right the decentralization of radical power equals the decentralization of catastrophic power [3222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3222.4s)

too so how do you deal with a world where like we only had one [[catastrophe weapon]] when we had the bomb but it was really hard to make so it's pretty easy to control and monitor but now we're talking about things that are not hard to make they're super super easy to make but super catastrophic so the decentralization of [[exponential tech]] gives a world of increasing catastrophes the centralization of it gives dystopias right now those are the only two attractors i got catastrophes or dystopias i don't like any of those options right so we need a [[third attractor]] that has the power to bind the tech in non to not be catastrophic but is not a [3257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3257.2s)

top-down hegemon in the way that it binds it which would be dystopic which means how do you actually facilitate a [[collective intelligence]] right something that is truly democratic but that is has the speed and effectiveness which means it can't have polarization it can't have tribalism we can't have any of those dynamics which [3276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3276.96s)

is why it will probably fail um and which is why there's cultural work that has to happen first and like pretty significant culture work otherwise the dystopias but that at least have top down control win and so this is why like i really am caring about this how do we upgrade people's orient cultural orientation to be like okay let me really seek to understand the other perspectives that i'm that i have currently just made the enemy and let me avoid the dopamine hits of certainty and righteousness that my perspective is already right because without that yeah there is really no chance at all like if [3316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3316.0s)

you don't start to have a cultural movement that can instantiate new types of institutions that are of foreign via people that would instantiate those better institutions then you either don't get the power to bind the tech in which case the decentralized versions of the tech that emerge anywhere will just cause catastrophes or you end up getting someone who has the power to do it but is not of form by the people because the people can't agree with each other in which case you get technology ai empowered authoritarianism and so like it's either ai empowered authoritarianism decentralized catastrophes or a radical [[cultural enlightenment]] to be able to have a government of formed by the people that has the capacities because we've also developed the people enabled in order to do that yeah you've called that the new enlightenment right something like that yeah something like that the term changes sometimes um so well how can we create a world that is more anti-fragile considering [3374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3374.96s)

these factors um when you think about what creates fragility you and i are talking on computers and microphones and all that where the the actual production of these computers took [[supply chain|supply chains]] that probably span six continents right in dozens of countries so something can break in a local area where they're the only place that has the mind for that thing or the ability to do that kind of lithography or whatever it is and you get you get cascades of breakdown and we saw that in wuhan right one area has an [3415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3415.119s)

issue and then you have to have travel lockdowns which means you can't move fertilizers across borders which means that you lose crop supply in northern africa and parts of the middle east that affect hundreds of millions of people you're like oh that's very fragile um so increasing more local closed loop dynamics [3433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3433.68s)

addresses fragility increasing stores of critical resource in terms of stocks and flows but there's a trade-off between resiliency and efficiency and we've indexed for efficiency so much because of money on money and dynamics that indexing for efficiency means i don't want any stores but that means much less resilient so there's a lot of things that we can [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3454.559s)

do infrastructurally and whatever for anti-fragility but there's nothing as significant as having a [[collective intelligence]] that actually thinks about the world better and can one problem solve better and problem solved with the other people which means cooperate and coordinate like sense make and choice make collectively better [3474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3474.559s)

and even more fundamentally don't make the problem worse by getting inducted as warriors in somebody's kind of narrative war or information war so uh the cultural shifts that we're talking about where people actually seek multiple seek many perspectives [3493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3493.68s)

yep that's a good one they seek many perspectives they seek to kind of empirically validate stuff they seek to synthesize them they seek to have real meaningful generative dialogue realizing that the other people that you hate are still political actors and they don't leave the planet just when you win they they do right um [3513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3513.04s)

and so you you have to coordinate with them or war with them um there is nothing we can do for resilience and anti-fragility better than increasing the [[collective intelligence]] of the people okay this is i want to double click on this idea of [[collective intelligence]] of the people so can you explain a little bit more what you mean by a [[collective intelligence]] for our listeners yeah we say [[collective intelligence]] we're talking about the intelligence of the people plus the ways that groups of people can be more intelligent than just the sums of the individual people so how do we make institutions and groups that are intelligent which has to do with things [3552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3552.799s)

like their ability to communicate and coordinate well obviously the reason we will have like a scientific institution is because some things are too complicated for a person to figure out so it takes a lot of people dividing up the work working together well but they have to be able to trust each other that they're not lying or whatever they have to trust [3570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3570.079s)

check each other's work they have to make sure their ego dynamics to take the credit don't get in the way too much that it kind of messes the stuff up so the the and if you have a bunch of really smart people and not a good system for them working together the [[collective intelligence]] of the group will still be low even though the intelligence of all [3584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3584.48s)

the individual actors might be high i have sadly been in many groups like that um me too and so democracy and markets are supposedly [[collective intelligence]] systems right how do we have the intelligence of everyone work together to have the best things emerge [3602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3602.0s)

the best choices made they've broken down in really significant ways and they need really significant updates um and like the best thinking at the time of adam smith or the founding fathers is not the best thinking anymore even though the spirit of some of those principles you know needs to continue um so when i'm talking about [[collective intelligence]] i'm talking about the world's ability to make sense of itself and make choices that everyone can contribute to and agree with that if they're going to be affected by it or bound by it we are living in an age where there's this weaponization of complexity and intellect and it has led [3641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3641.839s)

to anti-intellectualism and i would say distrust of science as a counter weapon and so i'm just wondering what you think we can do about that yeah we have a paper in the consensus project on the challenges of 21st century [[sensemaking]] that's worth checking out and um one of the uh things that is discussed is how many of the things that this i think this came out of the work of ulrich beck after uh the during the cold war and specifically looking at nuclear risk that um uranium isotope in the air after chernobyl blows up or whatever is invisible and the whether it is a democratic government or an autocratic government trying to figure out well how far did the wind blow that stuff to and what parts per million should we allow to say where do we tell all the farmers they have to tell [3704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3704.64s)

their stuff back into the soil versus we can feed it to people um if you don't have a geiger counter you're gonna have a real hard time just kind of rule of thumb in that one you know and so there are a lot of people who are like i just before the tech advanced very rapidly [3721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3721.44s)

and the world changed much slower you could just kind of have a though a sense of like the way we've done things for a long time is the right way to do things we can trust the knowledge of our forefathers we always done it this way yeah but you didn't have nuclear isotopes that's a new thing and your hunch for what happens with them is just gibberish it's based on [3738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3738.88s)

nothing right so we need geiger counters to check it out we need to do some studies on what parts per million really seem to have big effects but that means that there is some privileged class of people that know how to read a geiger counter and know how to do cell cultures that we have to trust as some new kind of priesthood to tell us what the invisible but significant means [3757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3757.52s)

and so how do we know if we can trust them because it is kind of it's invisible stuff and this is coveted again right like it's true or like okay we don't want certain kinds of petrol toxins or pesticides whatever in our food well when in when invisible stuff and this is [[climate change]] again has real causal implications so you can't sense it yourself [3781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3781.039s)

you have to basically uh empower some group that has the capacity to sense it and then the question is how do you do checks and balances on that how do you create an institution that has institutional capacity that the people actually trust that's right um [3801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3801.039s)

and it's you know it's a tricky thing but as we have a continuously technologically complex world we'll have more and more invisible stuff and more and more hyper object and complex stuff and more places where what affects one thing affects lots and lots of other things and all that complexity has to be factored [3821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3821.92s)

and so now think about it like this okay we want a democratic population who uh get to have a say in things but they want to have a say in things like the application of tech that they absolutely don't have the education to create that tech right it was a whole bunch of phd engineers from mit and [3841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3841.92s)

uh whatever that created the tech and they know they couldn't create the  tech but they want access to the tech and then they want to make sure that there isn't some governing body that is governing it in a way that will affect their convenience or their um economy or whatever it is it's like wait if you if you can't understand how to make the tech you probably can't be involved in its governance music um now that doesn't mean can't be involved at all you can say what your values are you can say what you care about you can still tweet your opinion about it well no that's actually the problem right i can tweet it i can tweet [3881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3881.68s)

an opinion that is based on gibberish yeah i was saying that ironically i know yeah okay so but in terms of the actual systems we want to develop um the ability to regulate a thing well and the ability to understand it well are coupled and this is that rights and responsibilities thing if i want to have [3902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3902.72s)

the right to really influence a thing there's a responsibility to understand it well enough that i actually know what i'm talking about oh i agree i mean it you see how many people on the internet think they're experts on the science of intelligence and bob makes my head want to explode um yeah so that just to take my own field for example so are most of these [3922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3922.64s)

issues that we're talking about ex you know [[existential threat|existential threats]] um are they historically novel how do you see that in terms of the whole arc of humanity yeah very hard for a caveman to blow up the world very hard for uh caesar to blow up the world fair enough right it's a technologically mediated thing [3947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3947.039s)

and as our technology got bigger our civilizations got bigger because we had technology that could extract resources and uh defend itself and whatever more effectively but what that also means is we had technology that could destroy ecosystems and win in war against other groups and so um if i'm chopping trees down like the world's pretty big if i'm chopping trees down with axes it does seem like trees are inexhaustible so we just price the tree at the cost to extract it i don't look at what it took nature to make it i don't look at the effects on the ecosystem of what it's doing to [3987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=3987.359s)

stabilize topsoil and watersheds and oxygen and co2 and all of that stuff it's just because there's still plenty of trees but i take this thing and make lumber out of it and so it's really just called taking the  from nature's being industrious and there is no balance sheet of nature that has to be paid or accounted for or whatever but when the tech gets bigger right and we start to get into slash and burn um of whole massive areas of forest to get the resources under them and we go from a fishing pole to mile long drift nets and we go from half a billion people before the [[industrial revolution]] to eight billion people empowered by those types of radical industrial and the nuclear aids and digital age [4029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4029.2s)

technologies the power of our tech has gone up so radically that the power of our both intentional and unintentional destructive capacity has gone up right and the constructive capacity also but if the constructor capacity is not for everyone it probably still has a [4050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4050.24s)

destructive element that's associated with it right oh yeah oh yeah and so um we didn't have the ability to start doing things at a scale that could really harm the world beyond our local area until the [[industrial revolution]] and the [[industrial revolution]] was like okay we can start to really scale some which is why we went from half a billion [4069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4069.599s)

people to eight billion people in almost no period of time even though 300 000 years of homo sapiens and we never broke a half a billion people and um and then it wasn't until the bomb world war ii that we had the ability to kill everything in a hurry [4086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4086.799s)

right that was a big deal so we had to make this entire [[world system]] the [[bretton woods]] un mutual destruction [[world system]] to make sure that we didn't use our new tech and that was one [[catastrophe weapon]] now we have dozens of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] it's brand new situation we have dozens of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] and instead of having two actors that have them or you [4106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4106.0s)

can do [[mutually assured destruction]] we have an indefinite number of actors and you can't even know who has them so you can't do mutual assured destruction part of the solution to world war ii not turning into world war three in the post-world war ii answer was we don't want the major empires to war even though the history of the world the [4124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4124.0s)

major empires always war but now the weapons are so big that if they do they  everything for everyone so they have to not war but everybody still wants more stuff so we have to get them to get more stuff without taking each other stuff so we just have to make exponentially more stuff so we're going to make a monetary system based on [[exponential growth]] and that's going to drive inexponential growth in goods and services but that also means an [[exponential growth]] in taking from nature faster than they can replenish and turn it into waste faster than it can be processed so then you start to hit [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] on overfishing and cutting down all the trees and excessive extraction of all the [4157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4157.279s)

resources and then turning it into [[climate change]] and pollution of a gazillion types over on this side microplastics and [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans so the solution to how do we not war drove all the planetary fragility issues and then the other thing was the other way we want wars we'll do this globalization thing where we get so [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4174.319s)

globally interconnected that you don't want to bomb each other because then your [[supply chain|supply chains]] are messed up but that is what then creates the fragility dynamics we mentioned where the world gets so complicated and so fragile that a little collapse anywhere can create cascading collapses [4189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4189.759s)

everywhere so basically there was no global [[catastrophic risk]] human induced [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] till world war ii we got our first one in world war ii it was such a big deal we built an entire [[world system]] to mediate it it bought us like 75 years of no world war but of course proxy war and economic war and infowar and whatever [4210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4210.719s)

it created all these [[planetary boundary]] issues created the fragility issues and created the proliferation of tech across dozens of sectors where now we have lots of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] right not just nukes but ai weapons and bio weapons and blah blah blah cyber weapons so now we're in the situation where we have to build a new [[world system]] again like we did after world war ii but it's for a completely different risk landscape and so it takes completely different characteristics it won't be based on [[exponential growth]] of the monetary system it won't be based on a system that drives more fragility so it has to have interconnectedness without fragility it won't just drive [4250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4250.0s)

tech to drive markets of all kinds it has to have anticipatory regulation because of the speed of the effective tech built right into the process um so this is basically what the world this is the challenge the world needs to rise to right now as i see it beautiful well i'm really glad there are people like [4268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4268.239s)

you who are thinking through these issues for for civilization thank you so much for being my podcast today where can people um you know what they want to read your papers you mentioned a couple papers that are coming out where can people read this stuff yeah they can go to uh consilience consilienceproject.org and check it out and i've noticed you're not on twitter [4288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4288.0s)

is that intentional uh yeah yeah i've contemplated but it hasn't been something i've needed to do yet there's someone called daniel schmochtenberger says on twitter did you know that did you know that i don't know who that is yeah i guess the [4308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4308.159s)

closest i can do to tag you when i when i tag you on twitter so sometimes i i talk about some of your stuff look dana i really always get so much from chatting with you today and i'm sure our listeners will as well thanks again for thinking about the future uh future of civilization and for chatting with me today on the podcast this was a really fun talk i enjoyed all [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YgNYdL7HTk&t=4328.08s)
