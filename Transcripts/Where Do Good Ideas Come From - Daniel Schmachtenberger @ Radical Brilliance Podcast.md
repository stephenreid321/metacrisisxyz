music welcome to the radical brilliance podcast with arjuna arda and brilliant guests from around the world who are contributing to the evolution of humanity music today's guest is daniel schmacktenberger who's going to talk to us about where good ideas come from [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=39.52s)

so here's your host arjuna music arda welcome back to the radical brilliance podcast today my guest is once again daniel schmacktenberger you heard from him earlier on in this podcast series talking about how to become an agent of [68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=68.56s)

evolution today we're going to talk about the mysterious conundrum of where do original thoughts come from i love to dwell upon this with many of my guests because it's such a great mystery to recognize that just as quantum physics educates us things arise out of no thing truly original things that are not just [95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=95.92s)

plastic imitations of something else they arise out of nothing daniel has explored this from many different angles from epistemology to learning systems to understanding the neuro science to understanding how is it possible that we can innovate it actually science defies it because really the only thing [118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=118.079s)

we know about the brain is what comes in through the senses so how can something arise in awareness that didn't first get there through the senses equally could ask we could ask ourselves how do we dream at night when you dream of something you've never experienced how did that happen it's very mysterious and strange [137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=137.12s)

so please enjoy this conversation with daniel shmachterburger one of the most brilliant minds alive today in my experience he's dense and solid and real and really well educated and articulate um pay close attention and daniel will guide us into the exploration of how original new ideas come into the [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=156.0s)

music world hey daniel how are you good happy to be here yeah happy to be with you you know i was reflecting upon what to talk about today and i wanted to tell you a little story which was actually my favorite story [184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=184.8s)

from all of the 450 interviews i did over the time leading up to radical brilliance and this story involves leonard cohen who is a mutual love of ours one of the greatest blessings in my life was was getting to know him so to cut a long story short after a lot of backwards and forwards i ended up actually being able to do an interview [208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=208.72s)

with lennon and i went to his house and we sat at his uh his kitchen table which was extremely much more modest than where we're sitting today this was like and this was an upstairs apartment in the wilshire district of l.a um uh you know look all the furniture looked like it had [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=231.599s)

come from a from a garage sale you know so we're sitting at his it is quite beaten up uh kitchen table which is just actually had two two settings on it you know it's a table just small enough for two people to sit we started talking about ten new songs you remember that album that came out in 2002 that had lovely and love itself and uh [248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=248.48s)

um i am not the one who loves it's love who seizes me incredible you know usually if i buy an album there's like one amazing song that i play over and over and over again and the rest just fades away this album 10 new songs every single song is like perfect you know so i started saying to [269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=269.04s)

leonard cohen i said i said leonard this this album is just like incredible and his response was oh yeah you know i went he had this kind of rye grin where half of his mouth would come like oh no and i said no no leonard i mean really this this is like this is this was beyond anything [288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=288.96s)

anyone's ever done and he was oh yeah and this went on for quite a while he wouldn't give in and the more he the more he dismissed it as just another album the more fervent more zealous i got that this was almost like scriptural you know so finally after about half an hour i won my battle with leonard cohen and he uh he kind of relaxed humorously [308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=308.72s)

and said yeah he said i guess i guess you're right something did come through on that album all right and i i actually reprinted that whole dialogue in the book and i felt it's very significant the language he used because he didn't say i did anything he said something came [328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=328.32s)

through on that album and then we talked a little bit about how that album had come to be and he explained to me why he was so hesitant to take any responsibility for it because he said really i just relaxed i just got out of the way and literally i received [345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=345.44s)

i received things that were ready formed and then it was just a matter of charting them down so most of that album came came to him when he was at mount baldy zen center which i think is somewhere out just just east of la he spent a few years as a monk there and during that time fragments came to him [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=367.12s)

but they they were received like gifts and later he went back to la and and and went into the studio his own studio and recorded everything so that's really the the pivotal point i wanted to start from that so many people i mean alex ebert of edward trump the magnetic zeros and so many leaders in technology people [386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=386.08s)

have invented things writers so many people use this language of yes something came through i didn't do it it came through so i'd like to unpack with you a little bit what that's all about yeah it's a it's a fun topic yeah um it's a topic that i have also been it's a topic that i've also been inspired by and [411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=411.12s)

um thought about and explored and investigated a good bit so i have some thoughts to share with you on it and uh i'm not sure that my conclusions are right but they are my best but they're the best you've downloaded so far right um we'll get there leonard cohen's a great example [437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=437.36s)

because did he experience what felt like it came through to him yes did it feel other than the self that he normally identifies with yes but it came through the person the nervous system the vehicle that spent its whole life making and attuning itself to music and it does not similarly come through people who have not spent their whole [465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=465.12s)

life obtaining themselves to music and specifically it's different than what came through mozart who spent his life attending himself to a different kind of genre of music right and which is also different than what comes through einstein who spends himself his life attuning himself to mathematics [482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=482.639s)

who also incidentally talks about things coming through the general theory of relativity came to him when he's in the bathtub and yet people who don't have a background in math and physics don't get general relativity right totally yeah and so then as we want to explore a little bit more what is the actual phenomena [499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=499.68s)

that's occurring uh it's a in in various kind of new age or spiritual schools there's this idea of a download and the download might be like that there's the akashic records where all the knowledge and all the stuff is or there is what bucky fuller called the design inspiring realm where there is some kind of higher knowledge source [520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=520.959s)

maybe a higher self or higher beings or something where i open myself to some kind of channel radio transceivers type and receiving something from elsewhere that's kind of the idea of a download right like when i'm downloading something on the internet i'm receiving information to my computer that was [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=537.839s)

stored elsewhere previously through some kind of channel and incidentally just to interject from it it's a really good analogy about about the computer because you have to have the bandwidth and you've got to have a computer with you've got to have a computer that can play that file right if you haven't installed adobe [555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=555.76s)

flash player 8 there's no point downloading the the file because it won't play so it's actually a good analogy to to what we were describing about you have to you have to put in your 10 000 hours to be worthy of the download so there's this yeah there's this question of am i refining myself to actually be [576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=576.16s)

able to be a radio receiver to this channel or is it actually better described by something other than download so that we'll play with this a little bit i actually saw um someone asked it's a long time ago and i might be remembering it off but someone asked eckhart tolle this [596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=596.32s)

question and he answered it beautifully i believe he was sitting in the dalai lama at the time and he said something to the effect of uh he said when yes when you enter a kind of transcendental state however you want to describe that transcendental state increased capacity emerges [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=613.92s)

as you emerge from that state but it's still tied to capacities you brought into the transcendental state so he said when a great soccer player has a has a kick to make and he drops into kind of a state of presence first he'll make the kick better than if he didn't but eckhart's like i still wouldn't make [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=635.76s)

the kick well no matter how deep my presence was and i don't think the dalai lama would either because our muscles weren't trained to kick and when einstein would drop in and come out with math and we've never come out with math and it's not because we aren't entering transcendental states it's because we [649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=649.839s)

aren't bringing math to those transcendental states and so um one way to think about it and i would say the way that i more tend to think of it is that it's more of an uploading than a downloading process and i'm not going to also say that there's only one phenomena i'm open to the possibility that the [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=671.36s)

idea that something comes from a source that is other than the through a process that is other than the process we're normally used to in terms of conscious rational process that there's maybe multiple different things that can be happening but i'll at least describe one of the most common phenomena i believe is say we take a psychic or [692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=692.88s)

someone who does channeling and let's throw out the ones who know that they're being charlatans or the ones who are just narcissists and don't know they're being charlatans but you know whatever and let's take the ones that a lot of people feel an authentic insightfulness from and try and explore the phenomenon in my [710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=710.8s)

early 20s i did this i i did these studies because i i found authentic insightfulness beyond what made obvious sense that they would have known and checked that they didn't have like something in their ear that was whispering answers to that i'm like what is this and then wanted to test it in a kind of [727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=727.6s)

scientific framework and it didn't show up when i was testing it so i said hey how do you get these answers so i channeled the palladians or metatron or the akasha records or whatever it was i said okay so do the akashic records have knowledge about say math yeah totally it's all there or chemistry so great what's the highest math you [745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=745.36s)

ever learned as a person they would say something and then i would ask a math question that that person had never heard they didn't possibly know the answer so it wasn't stored in their memory banks anywhere even unconscious memory but that has a very objectively true or false answer or chemistry question or [763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=763.04s)

my social security number and i would ask first is this a reasonable thing to ask that channel source they go sure and the answer was reliably wrong every time yeah and so it's easy for a skeptic to do that and then say it's all bunk throw it all out like they're obviously not downloading from some [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=783.12s)

source of all knowledge because we can ask for very discreet things and we don't we don't get the answer right more than statistically random we pretty much don't ever if it's those types of things i wouldn't throw it all out i did when i was 20 something but as i explored more i'm like why is it then when the person comes in [801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=801.44s)

and says two sentences the person the psychic gets quiet and then comes and says you're getting a divorce right now and they're like what the i'm getting a divorce how did you know that and that kind of phenomena actually does happen and we can describe it as cold reading but i'm saying that there's something [821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=821.519s)

other than conscious cold reading right the way that somebody in the fbi might be trained to cold read what is your vocal pattern and intonation and eye movement and body language actually showing i'm saying that our other than conscious mind can do that better than our conscious mind can and it can be trained and developed [837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=837.76s)

can i sure respond for a second so there's a distinction i want to run by you and what comes to mind right away i just picked this arbitrarily would be funerals okay you can i believe i've never done it but i believe you can hire professional mourners for a funeral this you know there's one eight hundred [861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=861.6s)

we cry for money right you can hire people to come to a funeral in large numbers they'll all dress in black and they will cry and they will go through the motions necessary for a good funeral and then you could have somebody who's been married to their spouse for 50 years genuinely bereaved [880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=880.16s)

superficially those things would look similar but i think you and i would agree that the experience of genuine grieving can't be put into the same bucket as a profession as as mourners on demand you know so i feel i i'm this is you know my gut my suspicion which is often all we've got to go on [900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=900.639s)

that the world of professional channeling however well-meaning it may be i don't i just instinctively don't feel like it's the same thing as when some you know when when somebody like einstein or or whoever is just innocently going about their day [925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=925.6s)

and based upon their readiness suddenly goes wow where did that come from but they're not without any intention to be without any language about channeling or downloading it's just like wow this you know this thing just suddenly came clear now i've got to unpack it so i'm wondering if these two [944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=944.32s)

phenomena of of people who set themselves up as channels and these these these things we can hear about that happen quite spontaneous if they really belong in the same conversation well let's play with it let's keep on packing them because um i would offer that they might actually belong to a similar class of phenomena [963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=963.36s)

at least some of them so again uh let's not take all people who charge money as a psychic in the same way and obviously someone might not charge money but let's take people that we could still be identified as a i'm a channel i don't care let's take people who whether they describe what they're doing [986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=986.079s)

is channeling or being intuitive they uh share things with people that they don't know where they got that people end up feeling are insightful more than was obvious and that their own described process is believed as earnest isn't just conscious cold reading what i think is happening is let's say i'm someone who's really been [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1011.12s)

interested in people my whole life since i was little and so i'm just watching people all the time and i'm paying a lot of attention to people and my my cognitive space my intuitive space is just being filled with human dynamics a lot like einstein's was physics and like leonard's cons was music [1029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1029.839s)

right i'm taking people in and so now i'm when i'm watching someone i'm i'm really fully with them paying attention on a lot of channels to their voice and to their body language into lots of things now i'm not going to remember hardly any of it i don't remember what you wore last time but at some level i was exposed to that information right so there's that possibility that that information is available it's just not something that is consciously available on demand so i you come in i'm a psychic and you say three or four lines and i say okay wait [1068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1068.72s)

and i am now i'm listening for my channel whatever it is but when i'm listening for the aliens or the angels or the akashic records or just being quiet and receptive and all of them i'm shutting off analyzing going quiet and receptive the hypothesis is that there is [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1087.28s)

a different kind of neural process that occurs where conscious thinking has to be serial because we can really only think one thought at a time so we have to say these pieces of data these axioms these logical steps this conclusion other than conscious mind being able to process much more things at once can do a parallel process but conscious mind turning off getting receptive parallel process occurs and i just take the gestalt of everything i got from you run it across all the things that i've been exposed to and look for similarities and it happens to be that there is a kind of similar pattern that pops up kind of not because of a serial process [1125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1125.28s)

because of a parallel process i'm like are you getting a divorce because the eight other people that had similar things were all getting a divorce and i don't know where it came from but i get an intuition in the hall that seems to come from nowhere i'm saying so the idea is maybe it comes from a download right from the some outside source i'm offering it as [1143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1143.6s)

the possibility of it an upload from deeper pattern analysis not as a conscious process but as an actual process that happens when someone has a lot of domain knowledge in a space and enters a state of increased coherence that allows a different kind of processing of that got it okay yeah and so if i'm einstein [1163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1163.12s)

and i'm working on the math of relativity and i get to a place where i'm just stuck and then i go and i just puff my pipe and look at the clouds and blank out now what's happening is a different set of neural processes take all that i just input contrast it with everything else that i had and see if an insight comes then i [1181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1181.84s)

get an aha and i go back to the chalkboard and i start working again so i get stuck and then i go back and puff my pipe and there's this back and forth between serial and parallel processing and i think that einstein very intentionally did that practice because he became aware that as soon as he got to a point [1200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1200.32s)

of diminishing returns on the logical part if he went and took a break and insight would come yeah and i think we i think with all of us probably you and i have had moments like that already today you know where you either alone or in discussion with other people where you pursue something through the best of your faculties and then just [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1219.2s)

and in giving up something new reveals music itself if you're enjoying this podcast with arjuna aarda and his radically brilliant guest you might also enjoy our eight week online group coaching program it's an opportunity to go deep and get stable in practices that enhance your own brilliance [1254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1254.0s)

so what i'd like to ask you is if so we've now we've kind of we've set up a bit of a parallel between the world of psychics you know who do this reading and the world of greatness of it's a tiny percentage of what happens in psychics that actually seems to be uh the meaningful legit yeah so we've set up this parallel of of of a [1343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1343.44s)

legitimate psychic reading or psychic or channel and then parallel to that is these moments of greatness that propel forward the evolution of humanity so i'm wondering if we could kind of now let the psychic thing go and just stay with the greatness together for a little while and just explore like so when [1363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1363.6s)

when somebody brings something in when something arrives fresh a song that doesn't sound like any other song you know a technology that doesn't look like anything we've heard before i don't know what would be a recent example yeah i guess actually maybe maybe the initiation the initiation of [[blockchain]] and the understanding of [[blockchain]] as an idea i don't know that much do you know much about the origins of [[blockchain]] i mean the it was uh what's the guy's name the the guy who we don't know who it is yeah yeah satoshi yeah as i understand it that wasn't really a modification of something else [1403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1403.84s)

it was it was really original thinking would that that be true there's a big question on what original thinking is yeah let's go there there's so first in terms of the parallel between those it's just that they're both places where we can hear the term download right and i'm offering that what is meaningful in those phenomenas [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1424.32s)

could be thought of as an upload and the psychic we just take off all the gibberish part we say just intuitive people who've paid attention to people so just like the scientist has paid attention to science if i've paid a lot of attention to physics i'll have a better intuition for physics because my intuition is a lot more primed if i've paid a lot of attention [1442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1442.24s)

to animals in the wilderness in a particular area i'll have a better intuition when i walk around the wilderness if i spend my life paying attention to humans i'll just kind of make sense of stuff faster better because i have a lot more pattern recognition so let's examine like a serial [1456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1456.0s)

entrepreneur like say steve jobs okay who well admittedly i'm i was going back to the first max but the icon based uh software on the first max actually did come out of um of the lab at xerox right so but let's take for example the way that he reinvented the phone and saw capacities [1477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1477.84s)

for a phone that we never no one had associated with the telephone and he really conceived the first smartphone right and then later the ipad i mean we didn't even know that that the ipad is famous because he managed to popularize something no one knew they needed right there was no demand for anything [1494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1494.32s)

like that he just created it so what's going on there i mean we we could look at multiple examples of innovators but in a mind like that that keeps doing that over and over again is that simply a matter of taking a lot of input letting it just stay in a in a sort unconscious way and then being out comes [1516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1516.88s)

the product or is there something else can we explain everything in terms of input or uploading that is delayed and then produced or could there be something more yeah so different i would say this is an interesting and important question that i want people to hold as a question and not default to [1539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1539.919s)

being too certain of an answer about yeah but i'll share some i'll share some thoughts about it one of the questions on the topic of original thinking or creative thinking is is there such a thing as original or is it all combinatorics right taking a number of ideas and combining them in a different way and so [1557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1557.36s)

you get a new result through combinatorial process but it was still dependent upon inputs i would say dependent upon inputs but not predictable from the inputs and that's because it's the inputs plus the synergy of those that leads to [[emergent property|emergent properties]] that are that weren't found in those parts separately [1580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1580.4s)

and so if i take a look at ford making the car from from buggies like nobody knew they wanted a car but we knew we wanted transportation we already had things with wheels we knew that horses were kind of limiting we knew that there was a lot of horseshit and whatever so it wasn't totally out of nowhere the same if i [1603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1603.6s)

look at the computer from a typewriter the same if i look at an ipad from a laptop right it was like i'm taking some kinds of things that people find interesting and recombining ideas but then combining them it's like if a cell respirates even though none of the molecules that make it up on their [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1624.96s)

own respirator you're like well where does the respiration come from well it doesn't come from any of the parts it comes from the way all the parts come together has this [[emergent property]] of life the bunch of molecules we don't define as live and so it's i think there's something to what we call creativity [1641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1641.36s)

that is combinatoric but then finding the right combinatorics where the synergy emerges and the [[emergent property]] is what we call the originality or the novel yes beautiful so let's do a quick review of some of the pivotal moments in the that we know about in recorded history and let's test this out so maybe we can take turns you know so [1662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1662.0s)

so as far as i can see a super pivotal moment that changed not just astronomy but a whole lot more was copernicus right so prior to copernicus we everybody thought that the the the heavenly bodies went around the earth but the problem with that was that they were now [1681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1681.919s)

completely chaotic so it postulated a god with add where things were going this way and that way up and down left and right and then copernicus postulated wait a minute if in fact everything was going around the sun then we would actually then we could actually make sense of the movement of all these bodies so not only did that [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1698.24s)

explain astronomy but it actually allowed us to believe in some kind of organizing principle that was coherent and that ushered in the renaissance basically actually did a huge advancements in science and architecture and everything because suddenly we could believe in a coherent universe so let's [1712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1712.799s)

so copernicus definitely was it was a pivotal moment it took until galileo to prove it and it was pure postulation until galileo so how does copernicus stand up to ingesting bits of data waiting out comes the result versus going into an empty state and something come and [1732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1732.399s)

in other words how does copernicus stand up to uploading versus downloading sure so if i there's a couple different elements there were a bunch of cultures before um copernicus in europe that had postulated a heliocentric solar system and so there's definitely a question if copernicus had actually become aware of eastern thought really other systems and there were other people that were working in related areas so it could be taking some ideas and advancing them but we could also easily imagine that he was the first person to think about that even within his frame even if other people thought about [1784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1784.64s)

somewhere else within his frame but i don't have to take a download to say i'm taking a different perspective right this is even by a rational process i could say all right well this model of explanation lee throws all these errors i get all these kind of incongruency so then i have to keep adjusting why god is [1803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1803.679s)

crazy to to do this or he goes is there any other explanation and try on another explanation well what if instead of it seems like the sun is going around us but what if we're going around the sun just i don't need to download out of nowhere to just be able to run other rational [1821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1821.2s)

hypotheses okay and we can all do this kind of process of saying is there another perspective i could take is there another hypothesis i could generate even if i've never heard that one before i'm just going into perspective and hypothesis generation and then some of them [1838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1838.48s)

will yield interesting results so when einstein was thinking as a young person like so galileo talked about being on a train going at a fixed speed and things that happened whatever what if the train was going at the speed of light what if it was a galileo talked about going on a train not at the speed of light but yeah he talked about [1857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1857.84s)

inertial reference frames but not train right uh galileo talked about an inertial reference frame okay okay and so einstein was thinking about inertial reference frames and then he's like well what would an inertia what would the as a thought experiment what would the perspective be like if [1878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1878.88s)

i'm writing on a light beam if to see requires light hitting my eyes could i actually see something if the light could never catch up to me so he's doing this thought experiment but he's thinking about a reasonable thing right he's just taking the perspective of a light being so when you say where does creative [1895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1895.679s)

thinking come from one place it comes from is taking other perspectives okay and so taking the perspective of the sun could help copernicus get good insights taking the perspective of a light beam could help einstein get good insights right so that's one kind of creative tool you'll notice that taking the [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1917.44s)

perspective of other people will help interpersonally profoundly okay got it yeah great and like one of the things that i really want to do most the time in personal relationships to say before i talk do i get the other person's perspective well enough that i can share with them and they don't need to add anything [1935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1935.36s)

otherwise why do i even want to share my perspective when it might be totally wrong it might be based on misunderstanding them completely when if i really understand where they're coming from i might have a completely different take on what i currently hold as my perspective let me ask you a question for a minute because [1950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1950.48s)

you just you just spoke about innovation really arises from taking just trying on different perspectives and you then you contrasted that interpersonally with taking on the other person's perspective what would happen if we postulated taking on the perspective of the whole i think that this is important you can't take on the perspective of the [1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1973.6s)

whole you can only take on lots of perspectives okay because perspective right the definition of a perspective is a frame of perception it's a point of view yeah yeah and so do i see this microphone right now well i see a perspective on it but i can't see what's on this side of it i can't see [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=1994.0s)

what's underneath it i can't see what a microscope's perspective would see i can't see if i took it apart and looked at the inside i can't see it the way that if i zoomed out and saw it in the context of the whole room so am i really seeing it well i'm seeing a perspective on it but does that give me all the [2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2007.519s)

information about it no so perspectives are inherently reductions of information right the perspective on a thing has less information than the thing itself has so but what you're saying is if we took if we could find a way to include multiple perspectives i start to get a more holistic and never complete [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2025.76s)

right now how can we apply that to our current predicament historically in the place we are in history because you know we know we know looking back that we've got five to ten thousand years of recorded history we know from anthropology and from archaeology that we've got way longer than that that [2047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2047.039s)

we've that we've been around somehow and that life has been around and even though we're facing potential catastrophe it seems i think intuitively feel something's going to survive right it may not be everything we have in the way that it is right now but something's going to continue [2064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2064.24s)

so and that something that continues can be in a spectrum of well-being you know of of catastrophe to pretty pretty good survival so how can we apply taking multiple perspectives to the kind of thinking we need to create the best possible future yeah i mean [2086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2086.24s)

it's both foundationally important and kind of obvious right when you set it up like that yeah is so when we come back to saying no perspective on a thing is the thing yeah then what we get is that truth itself is trans perspective and so every perspective has at least some truth in it [2114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2114.4s)

but like i'm looking at i'm looking at this side of the microphone the other side of the microphone might be painted different colors right it might have different symbols on it and so we could get an argument over what is the microphone look like so we could get in an argument over what the microphone looks like or anything [2130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2130.079s)

right what is the east side of the building versus the west side of the building and we're both there's truth in it but i might have yellow glasses on so the whole thing is distorted i might have a fish eye lens on that distorts the whole thing but that distorted view still has some truth quotient i just have to be able to [2146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2146.4s)

address the for the distortion so all perspective is at minimum partial oftentimes partial and distorted and yet still has some actual signal getting through and yet the truth of the thing what is the building actually like can't be held in any of the perspectives so then the question is [2166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2166.4s)

what is the minimum set of perspectives that i need to take and how do i put the partial truth from those perspectives together and how do i correct for distortion such that i start to actually get a larger understanding but not picture of the whole the moment i try and make it a picture if i want to make a picture of what the building looks like that [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2187.839s)

includes the inside and the outside and the east side and the west side i can't make a picture right i would have to distort it and then the whole thing would be wrong i can make a video tour yeah but now i've had to add the dimension of time to allow multiple perspectives right and so the the desire to be able to get on the outside of reality not be part of it be able to see the whole thing at once is actually a bad idea so how does how does collaborative co-creation affect what you've just said because actually theoretically one person would be limited by what you've said a group of people working together [2222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2222.0s)

would reduce that limitation well each person is going to have a perspective they might have some distortions some truth and some partiality so the question is is there a process of conversation that we can go through that can now if i'm if i think that my perspective has no distortions then i'm going to be limited in the type [2246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2246.64s)

of conversation i can have with you if i think my partial perspective isn't partial and it's the truth and the whole truth i'm going to be very limited in the kind of conversation what we can do but if i know that my perspective is partial and i'm open to the idea it might have a distortion i can't see and now i'm also open to the idea that it might have something novel to add [2264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2264.24s)

that others aren't seeing now we can actually have a meaningful conversation if we're all in that place right right then we can say well if some other people can see the same spots as me at least parts of the same spots and they and multiple of them aren't seeing the red that i'm seeing maybe there's a distortion how do we check it [2279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2279.2s)

out and if you're seeing something else over here maybe there's a partiality how do we show those together and this should be what the art of conversation is which should be at the foundation of civics right which is how but first at the individual level how do i make sure i'm [[sensemaking]] well how do i try and correct for perceptual distortions biases right and how do i try and take as many perspectives within myself as i can and how do i remove my identity from my perspective so that i can be trans perspective as opposed to being attached to an identity and an in-group that all shares that perspective right and then can i [2322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2322.079s)

actually listen to you and try that perspective on can i actually go and be in your spot try that perspective on try multiple on and then be able to have a trans perspectival frame not not frame trans-perspective or relationship with reality that is not holdable in one frame music as you're listening to this conversation with arjuna aarda and his radically brilliant guest you might feel inspired to go deeper into your own expression of radical brilliance come join us for a one week radical brilliance laboratory held in a beautiful rural location in the sierra nevada mountains of [2373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2373.04s)

california during the laboratory you'll have an opportunity to dive deeply into all four quadrants of the brilliant cycle this means you'll be able to explore experiences of consciousness without boundaries and you'll be able to start accessing original impulses of creativity from [2403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2403.28s)

within yourself that can become your unique contribution to the world music you can get in touch with your own learning and integrate mistakes that will allow you to mature and grow you'll have the chance to deeply mine your own resources as well as connect with other brilliant [2429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2429.68s)

people in a small intimate context for a week you can check out the radical brilliance laboratories at radicalbrilliance.com under the events tab so let's explore also you've just you've just asked questions very valuably referencing uh referencing [2454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2454.72s)

can can i do that but by definition when we collaborate or when a group people collaborate each each individual has the opportunity to do exactly what you've just said right so it's not just one person now seeing how many perspectives they can include what happens when many people not only represent different [2475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2475.68s)

perspectives but all have the shared intention to become multi-perspective so if we think about the way that our brain intakes information from our sensory organs if i just have one eye i can have distortions because where the optic nerve comes into my retina there is actually a spot where [2495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2495.599s)

light's not hitting so my eye has to move back and forth to be able to kind of fill that in but i can have distortions and i don't have depth perception in a single eye so i've got these two eyes and they overlap what they can see right so that does a couple things [2512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2512.56s)

it gives me error correction because where there is a mistake in this one or where there's a hole in the light this one will be able to see and because i can now calculate the hypotenuse of the triangle between them i get depth perception and because i can see the difference in the periphery from this one and this one i get peripheral vision [2529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2529.359s)

so i don't have the left eye and the right eye in a debate with each other right arguing over who is right they're completely collaborative yeah they're completely collaborative in a way that gives error correction to both of them and then what we call parallax which is additional information that neither had [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2548.4s)

on their own yeah neither had depth perception neither had clear periphery now then so the brain's job is not to have them debate it's to and it's not just to add them together it's to do this almost like magical phenomenal process of being able to get rid of the distortions in both [2569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2569.119s)

and then get new synergistic information that was contained in neither but is contained in the contrast of them that's one interesting thing about that analogy because when you talk about two eyes there are two eyes and actually biologists say that it's more accurate to talk about the body as a community of cells than as you know it just talk about the body as a thing is really inaccurate in the same way you're talking about you know a crowd at a football game it's not a thing it's a collection of individuals so you know we know this that that many of the cells in the body can could can exist and be transplanted they they are they can exist autonomous of the body so the eyes each [2606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2606.48s)

eye is like its own thing but the interesting thing about that analogy is it's being governed by a single intelligence right you've referred to it as they're not two brains one operating each eye yeah so how could we trans how could we learn from that in the same way like a [2623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2623.04s)

beehive operates that way yeah how can we posit a way of creating a future where something similar happens in the way that you and i could collaborate but really with the experience of being governed by one intelligence that we that we are both instruments of yeah so let me give another example that will be [2645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2645.68s)

important for how we do this so now i've i've got two eyes that are doing this for vision i've got two ears that are doing a similar thing for hearing and the sound waves are going to hit this ear first and then this year later if the origin of the sound is coming from there and so i can get [2662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2662.88s)

uh an awareness of where things are in the space based on the difference in the ears i also will be a louder ammonia right yeah yeah and so now the brain has to run a parallax between the ears but then i've also got between the ears and the eyes which are totally different types of [2679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2679.68s)

information not just different locations of a similar type of sensor because i can see where something is and hear where it is and if i get conflict between those then we throw an error right i can hear something and turn around to see it to try and verify and get additional information and so not only is the brain working on [2696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2696.079s)

creating a a unification right rather than say a singular i'll say there's a unifying process that creates continuity between the left and the right eye left and right ear but also between the ears and the eyes also between the ears and the eyes and proprioception and smell and the internal sensing and external sensing and all of the stuff to [2714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2714.8s)

create a coherent sense of self and a coherent sense of reality so that i can navigate you know what i'm realizing as you speak is actually there's another element that we haven't i don't feel we've quite labeled coherently enough that we've got two ears two eyes a brain but we've also got an incredibly [2733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2733.2s)

complex high-speed communication mechanism between all of them we've got neurons that are also an intrinsic part of that whole piece so i guess would be analogous to highly effective communication between people so if i look at the way the sense organs all get processed together to get a [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2755.839s)

perspective on self and a perspective on the world that factors all of them tries to factor the distortions and limits out of each tries to give synergistic information across them that allows me to navigate the world well i can see that this happens on so many levels i can now rather than look at the sense [2773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2773.119s)

organs i can look at the neurons and say each neuron is doing some information processing but a whole neural network or the brain as a whole is doing synergistically more information processing than the sum of those neurons separately some of the neurons will actually get some wrong information processing [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2793.2s)

they'll throw some errors and if those errors keep cascading then we'll get major problems so the brain has processes of error correction where if one particular neuron throws some error there are ways of being able to detect that meaning i'm getting information from this neuron over time so i can contrast [2810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2810.56s)

that signal this second versus a second ago in a second from now i'm also getting information from other neurons nearby right there's a way of being able to contrast all that so that i can get both error correction and parallax again information that exists only in the contrast of these different informations not on any of them on their own [2829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2829.92s)

if we started to think about humans as sense organs or humans as neurons and being able to say we're all sensing something we're all processing some information rather than debate with each other or rather than say we're processing such different types we can't interact we have to only interact with other specialists of our type like eyes and [2848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2848.48s)

ears not wanting to work together or are we open to left and right right our left eye i i don't go with you liberal types right so is it what if we said that we are inevitably as individuals and as small groups and as whatever partial groups affecting the [2877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2877.2s)

other individuals and other groups and partial groups we're affecting the whole and we're inevitably being affected by the whole and so if we could have better coordination with the whole that would work out better for everybody we can see war as a failure of coordination between the people on both sides to come up with [2896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2896.4s)

a solution about them killing each other yeah we can see environmental collapse as a failure of coordination between our current self and our future selves and our grandchildren where we're where we're getting ahead today by doing things that are actually ruinous to our own future care and incidentally both war and uh [2911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2911.04s)

environmental degradation both have great analogies in the body yeah they do yeah that's i think it'd be a good idea to if you don't mind that we can kind of start to to bring this to a good conclusion by seeing you know we've floated a lot of very useful ways of seeing things here [2932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2932.24s)

how can we wrap this up that becomes poignantly relevant to facing our predicaments as a race today you know we've we've got we've got big crises to face we've got also incredible opportunities for evolution so i get there's a i i'm hearing there's a lot of there's a lot of things fairly near the surface and what you've said that we can apply to um to evolution to conscious evolution let's see if we can you know um we've talked about a number of things that are not the same thing not the same mechanism and so um you know like the first point we're [2974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2974.079s)

talking about uploading or downloading or and recognizing that the depth of experience we have and the depth of work and exposure and training in a field through whatever mechanisms increases the kind of intuitive and insightful capacities in those fields then you say well [2993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=2993.28s)

knowing that i'll kind of trust my intuition more in domains where i actually have a lot more domain knowledge and other ones i'll listen but i'll check it and in areas where i really want to have meaningful creativity i'm willing to work at it like i'm willing to actually put the work in and i'll recognize that if i've [3010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3010.079s)

hit a diminishing response curve where i'm hitting my head against this thing i'll see if i can go access quieter states and then i'll see if i can get any insights and come back so there's a whole set of insights around that process but i think the most you know important thing from this conversation relating to the world and it's i mean it almost sounds trite and yet it's so profoundly missing is perspective taking and perspective seeking yeah i actually have uh there's a guy from the kind of integral philosophy world who uh named clint who was sharing with me a phd dissertation he did a little while [3050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3050.079s)

ago it was quite interesting yeah yeah he's he's a interesting thinker it's been kind of long held that higher stages of consciousness are associated with the capacity for perspective taking the ability to have identity decoupled from perspective and so as he was doing some kind of [3071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3071.92s)

deeper study and analysis the insight that he came from was it's actually not so much perspective taking ability as perspective seeking orientation right it was a more active not just i can take someone else's perspective competently but that i'm actively doing it i think this is hugely valuable yeah and [3089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3089.44s)

saint francis says seek more to understand than to be understood for so many reasons because the thing i wanted to be understood about i find out was wrong once i understood the other side i don't even want to be understood about it once i have understood the other side what i have left to say is not only more clear and meaningful [3108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3108.72s)

but also there's more receptivity in the other person since i've heard them and they know that i get it and i care and i don't want to harm the things that they care about right like for all those reasons but also when you come to things so this is key for if you want to if you want to stop war you have to actually have each of [3125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3125.52s)

the sides be able to really get the come from of the other side to come up with a proposal that could actually work if you want to get over left right kind of polarization you got to say okay as long as we keep making proposals that either benefit the economy and ruin the environment or help the environment and ruin the [3143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3143.119s)

economy we're screwed if we keep making dumb proposals like that because they both matter and when we put them in a theory of trade-offs the people who are having the hardest time paying the bills can't be environmentalists and the people who walk through the forests a lot and are doing all right financially [3158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3158.16s)

don't get a care about your kids who have a hard time getting a job even though they would like to so let's see if we can do a better job of rather than making the other guy an enemy because he's trying to harm the thing you care about because it was a dumb proposal to begin with based on his theory of trade-offs can we at least get their perspective to be like oh [3172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3172.88s)

that perspective also has truth that matters i need to come up with a proposition that factors what is meaningful from that perspective too where i'm hearing that everything we've talked about today from the downloading all the way through to the to the widening of perspective what all of that [3188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3188.4s)

has in common is actually unvelcroing to some degree from the grip of what you thought you knew to be true because the the the downloading that we talked about actually requires you to take a break from being knowledgeable and to enter into into a more kind of spacious state which is where often this kind of [3208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3208.48s)

downloading experience happens but equally being open to other perspectives realized it requires you to release your grip on where you thought you knew where you thought you had all the answers completely yeah it's i mean it's actually really um such a valuable insight that if i'm wanting a solution that i don't [3227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3227.04s)

currently know it's not going to come from re-running the set of things i already think i know right if i'm wanting anything that is actually creative or actually innovative what that means is that it's it's not just the thing that i already had right and so there's a place of being able to as you said enter into where new solutions might exist [3248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3248.88s)

that i don't already have yeah exactly i was just laughing when you were speaking because you know sometimes when you hear somebody speak in a generalized way you illustrate it and i was just remembering the times when you know i've lost my car keys or something and i go look in the places it might be when i can't find i can look in those places again yeah two or three times instead of looking in new places yeah i go back and look at the places i've already looked thanks a lot for hanging out today i feel like you know it's uh what i really love about talking with you is um i see how you have the wisdom [3281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3281.28s)

to stay in the exploration more than the a place of arrival and that i find that incredibly refreshing and and uh it makes it makes these conversations really alive and uh and like we're you know like we're really at the frontiers uh instead of sitting comfortably in the living room of our already populated area totally [3305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3305.04s)

thanks a lot man thank you it was fun music wow i hope you enjoyed that conversation with daniel schmacktenberger as much as i always enjoy hanging out with him i'm going to ask you to reflect a little bit on this conversation it's always helpful when we can remove from passivity in listening to a [3340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3340.799s)

podcast into co-creativity where we we make it real for ourselves so i'm going to ask you in the light of this conversation to reflect upon your own experience think about the last time something completely original came into your mind that you'd never thought before what was it preceded by the last time you thought a thought that had never been thought before or said something that had never been said before how did that come into your awareness where did it arise from and what was the fertile soil in which that took place everything that daniel shared with us today [3377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYoSctj3C8&t=3377.28s)

came from his exploration of his own experience i want to invite you to do the same and to learn something from your own experience about original creativity thanks so much for being my guest on this podcast i'll look forward to catching up with you next time music you
