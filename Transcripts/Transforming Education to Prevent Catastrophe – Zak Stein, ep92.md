so that the ai tutoring system is one of the most important conversations that can be having that can be taking place right now this will either be the thing that that saves us or completely destroys us hello everyone my name is stephen partin and you're listening to the feedback loop by singularity before we jump into today's episode i'm excited to share a bit of news first [34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=34.739s)

i'll be heading to south by southwest in austin on march 14th for an exclusive singularity event at the contemporary a stunning modern art gallery that is in the heart of downtown austin this will include a full day of connections discussions and inspiration with coffee and snacks throughout the day with an open bar celebration at night so if you're heading to south by and [61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=61.14s)

you're interested in joining me and having some discussions meeting our community of experts and change makers then you can go to su.org basecamp dash south by southwest which i will link in the episode description so you can sign up for this free invite-only event and just to know it is not a marketing employee when i say that space is genuinely limited so if you are serious [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=84.36s)

about joining you probably want to sign up as soon as you can and get one of those reserved spots and in other news we have a exciting opportunity for those of you with the track record of leadership who are focused on positive impact specifically we're excited to announce that for 2023 we're giving away a full ride scholarship to each one of our five [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=107.22s)

very renowned executive programs where you can get all kinds of hands-on training and experience with world leading experts you can find the link to that also in the episode description and once more time is of the essence here because the application deadline is on march 15th and now on to this week's guest writer educator and futurist zach stein who is [131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=131.76s)

well known for co-founding the consilience project with daniel schmachtenberger as well as his recent publication education in a time between worlds essays on the future of schools technology and society in this episode zach takes us on a well-articulated tour of the philosophical and socio-cultural conditions that are causing us to fail [157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=157.2s)

at our central task of educating the next generation along the way we discuss how technology is playing a role in this struggle for [[sensemaking]] from [[social media]] to the future of ai tutors much of this zach explains is due to the current issues that are taking place in the informational landscape issues that he explains could have catastrophic [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=179.58s)

consequences if not rectified but zach can explain this all so much better than i can so without further ado please welcome to the feedback loop zach stein so that we can get kind of a big picture of of your work and the things that you do is maybe to start with the consilience project and what motivated you and daniel schmachtenberger to put together that [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=206.64s)

organization so the consilience project was born in the wake of the many crises that followed from covid sense we had brought together a team of researchers to kind of look at the information ecology try to figure out what was going on and this led us to a set of important [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=229.62s)

reflections on the [[sensemaking]] crisis which had already been named by uh daniel and others um and so we began just a systematic approach to trying to articulate the questions that were most basic to understanding the nature of the [[sensemaking]] crisis and the threat that the total confusion of the media ecosystem has generated the [253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=253.739s)

individual and the institutional kind of bureaucratic decision-making level um so that was the impetus and in a sense it the prior impetus was to begin a conversation about existential and [[catastrophic risk]] and specifically the what we now would call the [[metacrisis]] but this overarching threat to the nature of civilization and possibly the continuity of life itself [278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=278.34s)

and we realized that we couldn't really even have that conversation in a public forum because of the state of [[sensemaking]] itself so the first move to even begin a conversation about the future of civilization is to make a place where that conversation is actually possible and at first we were attempting to address the media itself and then [300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=300.96s)

realized that a better approach would be to reflect on the nature of the sense-making crisis and and so that was the the hope and now we're moving the work to a place where we're going to begin to to speak of the [[metacrisis]] could you talk a little bit about how [320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=320.4s)

the information ecology and the [[metacrisis]] that we find ourselves in came about what was the i guess arc that brought us to this point was it something that was pretty um dormant for for most of civilization and then god really exacerbated because of technology because of the internet because of [[social media]] like was there any real ramp up points or milestones that really drove this into the place of disorientation that we are now kind of depends who you ask you know not not in a relativistic sense but in the sense that it's a truly interdisciplinary question that you know one of the ways to think about the [[metacrisis]] is as a kind of a causal or nexus causal type of [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=364.5s)

phenomenon where you're looking at many many complex causal pathways into this phenomenon which is in a sense of emergent phenomenon from the many subsidiary crises and the [[generator function|generator functions]] of those so there really are very truly distinct and and comparably adequate perspectives on the issue one one perspective would be yes this is primarily about [389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=389.819s)

exponential technology brought into the context of societies that are kind of operating the way societies always have and then you bring exponential technology and you've changed everything uh there's also one that this is fundamentally more about technologies of media which is this technologies of [409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=409.979s)

communication so there's a clue and ask type characterization of this which sees it as essentially the [[metacrisis]] being some kind of inevitability of the digital um and then there are other ones and i'm a philosopher of education so i see this as a compounding educational crisis which is to say a [434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=434.18s)

self-amplifying educational crisis because the problem with educational crises is that they degrade the overall capacity to recognize the ability that there is an educational crisis right so that there are some crises that have self-amplifying properties in the educational crisis has this so if we set in certain errors in the [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=454.199s)

structure of the way we did education let's say post-war those would begin to play out and then they would self-amplify to the point where you'd have a profound society-wide education crisis which i believe we have in a context when more money is being thrown into into educational reform than ever so you get the kind of diminishing returns on investment and complexity uh [476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=476.58s)

which is a characteristic of [[civilizational collapse]] more broadly so those are three there's other views um you know economic it's hard not to see this as a climax of a uh untenable economic an untenable fundamental economic paradigm which is to say infinite extraction of a finite resource right and we can do that there's a whole kind of rabbit hole down seeing this as [507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=507.0s)

a result of kind of economic [[generator function|generator functions]] if you will yeah and that's the problem with the [[metacrisis]] is that there's not one route there's actually many many routes uh many inter-animating crises which means that mitigation of such a crisis such a [[metacrisis]] requires a concerted effort of many very distinct groups [534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=534.18s)

i was going to say is this why you look to education because it in a way it's almost a way to train the wisdom or the understanding of complex thinking or complex science to understand how these things coalesce i mean if you look for the root education is rude all of the other crises are fundamentally crises of human [[decision making]] the root of human [[decision making]] is how that human was educated and so there's a fundamental source problem of the type of mind that is being created and domesticated and made common within our civilization is a mind that has created patterns and processes within the civilization that are driving it towards self-determination so that there's a there's a fundamental problem in [583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=583.26s)

educational paradigm if it's creating psychological and skill sets and personality types that are not allowing the civilization to to transform in ways that have it maintain its viability so it's a root it's a root of the many crises um and uh it's what's so funny about you know educators know this yeah uh um and there's something interesting [612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=612.899s)

about education as i define i'm not talking about schools and so i think that's the the thing that maybe people would hesitate to take this view is because they have all the things you know there's way more than just failure of the schools uh and in fact maybe the schools aren't failing but the point is that the education of a society as i define it is one of the broadest social [631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=631.5s)

functions of society that's performed by almost every institution but specifically the institutions of the family of school and of law and of course media uh being the other obvious one so the idea here is that it's not failure of school it's actually inadequacy of total set of educational [652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=652.339s)

institutions that are responsible for the auto poetic reproduction of the skills necessary to maintain the civilization and often when civilizations or any [[social system]] is in crisis the education system then has to change its nature so that it doesn't just simply reproduce the same skill set into [674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=674.339s)

a place where they're not relevant but can make new skills and so we're in that kind of crisis where for about 30 years or more the educational system has needed to change much more fundamentally than it has been able to change and in what ways because you know you do talk about the two worlds that were between this this sort of liminal state that we've been in [696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=696.24s)

maybe for those 30 years um what is it that we we left behind and was it that we're moving towards what is that transformation what are the transformational endpoints there there are several and they kind of pulled together some of the threads because it's related to the the interdisciplinary of education as a [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=715.38s)

[[problem space]] right so like you when you think about what happened from 1972 to 2000 of them from 2000 to now in the large-scale public school system let's say in the united states right uh you had a profound move out of a prior model um so you got the birth of the great american high school which was the [739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=739.26s)

climax of the kind of modern architecture four large-scale public kind of bureaucratic school systems right prior to that in the united states you still had wonderful houses right they just want to know that like the the total kind of creation of what we think of as the public schools uh now the concept goes way back to our friend [763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=763.019s)

johnny most comedius and others moving through the enlightenment but you know the beacon to the world that america sent out post-war america as part of the cold war competition was a a size and scope of public bureaucracy for schooling that was unprecedented and it was specifically the reflection of a kind of factory model of schooling um and it was training specifically [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=789.36s)

american citizens so this was the height of the american civic religion that the civil rights movement in the united states which was one of the most important kind of world historical ethical things that the united states was able to kind of do um uh where did that occur in in this in the conversation about schooling fundamentally it was in the conversation about schooling that it was in the american schools that we were able to exemplify democracy and this is of course again related to the cold war sputnik the launch of sputnik was one of the things that actually galvanized this in uh the kind of full investment in a very complex uh bureaucracy for training american citizens as you move into the 80s and 90s you get a transformation out of the model uh of training for a kind of civic religion of american citizenship and into uh the kind of gates era of anthropic investment in education uh which moves from the large factory [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=857.459s)

school to something like the small startup charter school or mini high school where you take a large high school and disaggregate it into a bunch of small focused ones which look a little bit like startup companies and you invest a lot in digital technology and the civic religion of america has kind of been on the decline and so now [877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=877.38s)

you're promoting something like a 21st century skills planetary citizenship in a global economy right uh but know the difference here right you're preparing people to be individuated workers in a digital workforce made up of small little unit companies which may or not may not be viable as opposed to train them to be american citizens to work in factories [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=901.38s)

and to become scientists and to be the russians so is this a big part of the issue here then is these kind of economic incentives that that come along with maybe increase globalization and the increased scaling of digital technology that makes something like a more meaningful education less valuable well so there's [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=919.98s)

the redefinition of what it means to be a well-educated yeah and that's been always slowly changing uh and the the shifting of allegiance of identity uh which is one of the things the school does and understand it's like the american civil religion was not great like i mean like one of the reasons that we push towards this multicultural 21st century skills global [949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=949.56s)

citizenship thing was because of how kind of bad simple nationalism uh is uh and the emergence of globalization as a phenomenon which takes rudens ladies and through the 90s and now by 2000s just a no-brainer that's just the [[supply chain|supply chains]] the information flows the insane the instantaneousness of communication through digital technologies forces the [975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=975.3s)

issue of global dispositions so it's a long complex history and this would be a diversion but it's it's important to see that there have been these logical progressions in the large-scale public school systems and the ones who are now right now we're kind of in this ceiling effect where we actually need to completely disassemble the thing that the digital portend did something much [997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=997.98s)

much greater than it has realized in the context of education and this is what my book is about and so we need to actual planetary scale distributed educational hub network so what's that look like i mean what's it look like to to start making that switch just you know if we're hitting that ceiling and we need to kind of tear down these these uh prehistoric structures in a sense that [1024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1024.86s)

no longer serve us how do we make that transition without just having you know chaos and what does that thing we build kind of look like the idea i mean so yeah chaos is bad but it's like it sounds good right now fair enough yeah i mean like if you just look at the adolescent health crisis alone and it's the adolescent health crisis is probably [1049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1049.4s)

the canary in the mind for the true failure of the educational system not the schools well the schools have tried their best we're talking about the media i'm talking about the structure of the family i'm talking about the absence of anything like coherent religious ideology so you get it from youtube like i'm talking about a whole complex set of things uh which have made it so that we are truly an unprecedented and if you're in a psychologist frightening situation of adolescent mental health uh where it's not clear that as these individuals become adults they will be able to take over the responsibilities they will have to for the civilization itself to run so we're looking failure of [1089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1089.48s)

intergenerational transmission which means a failure of the elders to pass over the responsibilities for running civilization to the youth because we have not prepared them we've actually hurt them instead of strengthening them somehow there's an irony here though a little bit if i can quickly point out i feel like is i want to agree with this idea that you're pushing towards maybe [1109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1109.58s)

this more decentralized idea and i often feel very strongly that the more we individualize the instruction to the individual the better but also part of what i'm hearing is like the loss of authority or almost like the nietzsche's idea of god is dead you know without some central hierarchy or informational meritocracy [1131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1131.539s)

part of the issues that have maybe arisen are from the fact that people are being educated through [[social media]] rather than through something that kind of gives them a real [[sensemaking]] apparatus or gives them some curated curriculum you know the the decentralization of educational systems is not the non-hierarchicalization of teacherly authority fair enough in fact right now because we have created artificial context where we have made teacherly authority only bureaucratic we have a situation where people don't know how to engage with teacherly authority at all uh and so that's that's key so that's a very real concern in fact the the the kind of like decentralization of knowledge production processes can work against the quality of the knowledge that's propagated um so it's important not to confuse decentralization with the absence of quality control in information yeah is this a is this a [[value system|value systems]] issue that's maybe arising a bit from [[social media]] as well because when i think of the way that you know humans are social apes kind of learn what to prioritize if i was born into this world and i was to look at something like [[social media]] and see what was most uh you know had the most valence and the most salience and was most rewarded by society i would not [1222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1222.02s)

see something that makes me think that like being a independent free thinker and like trying to stay out of the chaos is good i would actually think that wading into the chaos being controversial becoming and you know an influencer rather than like a thinker is the key thing here so i mean i can't help but think part of the disorientation or the the failures in [1245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1245.62s)

education is part of us just not feeling motivated to be educated in that way or or to value those things yeah i mean there's there's definitely a shift in cultural value that has contributed yeah to the the confusion and depression of youth as so this is true but the [[social media]] thing is is much worse actually uh [1272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1272.059s)

[[social media]] is predatory on the young spirit to say that it is it is preying upon the attention of the young to make money off of them without giving them any benefit uh i believe it's widespread low-grade child abuse i mean what other situation do we put kids in this where we put kids in front of something which wastes their time [1297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1297.919s)

dysregulates their attention and extracts their attention as a resource to siphon off for money it's by selling ads right so this is something we have normalized and it is systematically destroying the youth and that's part of the mental health crisis is like looking at the delta beg why aren't you why aren't you doing something [1317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1317.84s)

like you know this is terrible you know it's not good for me oh because you're addicted too right okay sorry they got to all of us so the algorithmic capture of attention and then the sequenced exposure to various forms of synthetic media through the infinite scroll which characterizes massive amounts of time of adolescent experience uh isn't just a matter of values it's [1345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1345.679s)

literally a matter of central [[nervous system]] dysregulation through tech through technology uh and so again tick tock is probably the greatest example of this but but most of them are built to be addictive and they are not built to educate at all and so that's a deep deep problem and so how do we solve that problem by just [1371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1371.78s)

making schools more like schools right we don't just make schools we'll just throw more standardized tests at the schools or we'll make them just sit in front of a computer and pretend that's cool right when in fact it's exactly the same type of experience they have when they sit in front of [[social media]] and now you've just blurred the distinctions between it entirely [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1389.48s)

right so we have to make educational intervention that is more interesting than [[social media]] and we need to regulate [[social media]] like what it is which is an addictive substance that's just drawing the minds of the youth and i sound alarmist but someone else actually let's i don't have the statistics but bring the statistics in here and let's talk about how it's going [1414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1414.32s)

with them and tell me that your child's addiction to facebook or tick tock or youtube or instagram or someone i've never even heard of that you don't even know about because you don't know what your group does on this phone let's have that conversation instead we're ashamed of what we're putting the youth through we've also systematically indebted them which is another thing you don't do if [1433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1433.94s)

you want to prepare people to take over the responsibilities of a civilization you don't make them indentured servants to the people who are currently running the civilization yeah or the only large industrial nation that's done that so so yeah it's uh i believe it's uh travesty [1452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1452.659s)

and we will slowly see the consequences we already are now if ai is able to make it so that a lot of the jobs we need done to keep civilization going can be done by machine intelligence then the fact that we just made the future of workforce completely incompetent isn't as big of a problem we've also made them very docile a completely manipulable in terms of [1475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1475.82s)

these [[social media]] technologies so there's another scenario where we just build something like a complex zoo and we house the youth in it and extract the ones who are needed to do the most creative work uh so none of these scenarios are good so the ai intervention is another thing that the educators have to be very wary of um both ai induced systemic unemployment and ai tutoring systems what do you think about the tutoring systems do you think that would be good for for making it more individuated helping kids kind of find their own dao so to speak their own personal path that's meaningful to them and intrinsically motivated so that the ai tutoring system is one of the most important conversations that can be having that can be taking place right now like these this will either be the thing that saves us or completely destroys us yeah and so i i there's so many ai risks and like this is one of the things that i do that you think about risk and as a philosopher of education i think a lot about a weird class of risks which are [1549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1549.5s)

the risks that have to do with intergenerational transmission which is i've already named it here but if you fundamentally disrupt intergenerational transmission you've just destroyed your society do you think that gap is part of the issue here in a sense because the previous generation just doesn't realize how quickly things are changing with [1571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1571.22s)

technology and therefore can't understand it i'm saying that the ai tutoring system makes possible a catastrophic bifurcation of international transmission of a type that could never exist without this type of technology specifically because what you're going from is the human being is a biological being [1591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1591.98s)

that is raised by other human beings to the human being who has a biological being who is raised by a machine so now you imagine an ai tutoring system depending on the rate of adoption of the tutoring system and it's again everyone's thinking yeah oh it's like a teacher this is an ai socialization system [1615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1615.02s)

right don't think they're not coming for your parenting right they're coming for parenting the ai parent is almost has to by default i mean it has to it's the most fundamental unit of where education resides and so the interesting question when you have the ai tutoring system that has catastrophically bifurcated intergenerational transmission and [1638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1638.179s)

created a generation raised by machines not raised by humans what does it tell them about the prior humans which created it which it did not raise so this is two questions but given that the consillions project and a lot of what you're working on is figuring out how we navigate this transformation navigate into this future and one of those things involves [1661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1661.46s)

governance what do you see the approach to governing this one the [[social media]] aspect that we talked about that's just basically child abuse and the ai tutor aspect of things like how that develops do you do you see a path forward or do you have any ideas on movement in that direction that you think is best yeah so there's also a work i do at the at the office for the future with uh [1690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1690.2s)

gaffney and ken wilbur and they were working on this problem of techno feudalism uh the problem with techno feudalism is yeah there's a political there's a there are political accoutrements to these forms of uh to these forms of i don't know what the word would be uh social existence right mediated by digital technology ai tutoring systems [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1713.659s)

structural unemployment right um if the ai tutoring system rolls out through a market-based competition uh where we're still wedded to attention capture business models um then you would have a real real problem [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1733.039s)

uh and get um again some of it looks a lot like a techno feudalist situation where you've got these non-overlapping epistemic empires of people who are completely captured by an extremely persuasive ai technologies right and i'm dogma the united states i know what china is doing it's likely china will not build one based on a [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1755.539s)

market-based competition china will probably build one right with a whole bunch of strategy right we will maybe build six or three or something like that different and we're maybe a little bit of a really complex suite of them like our educational system that would be socioeconomically stratified right so there's many ways [1775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1775.039s)

that that plays out in the techno feudalist one uh if you infuse the design of the ai tutoring system with actual first principles and first values of design that factor both the nature of the cosmos the nature of the human uh then as i said this thing could be the thing that actually gets us out of the [[metacrisis]] so this is like a a design conversation that's so fundamental and so important about very deep philosophical questions which we haven't been able to really think about like for a very long time in modern society um so like ai tutoring system has to answer the question of what is a good human right and i was going to ask you do you [1814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1814.7s)

have a direction you lean in towards what that more harmonious uh relationship with what it means to be human looks like compared to what i know you've called in the past the nihilistic design of technology do you do you have a bit of a vision of what that looks like you know what are some of the characteristics of that uh healthier human dynamic that you think we could [1835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1835.7s)

point towards so in education technology specifically uh i believe that no education technology should ever be designed to obsolete human relationship this is big and this goes back to skinner which is what gaffney and i are writing about in the techno feudalism context it's like [1857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1857.6s)

the original idea of the teaching machine goes way back and it's precisely the idea of me and a machine alone uh and that's what khan academy is i mean that's what all of the digital educational enterprises primarily are are ways to make it so that your engagement with a machine is maximally educationally beneficial right if we [1878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1878.96s)

keep running that model then we'll get an ai tutoring system that knows more about you than any teacher or parent possibly could know about you and knows more about the world than any teacher or parent could possibly know about the world and it can match its knowledge of view with its knowledge of the world and become the most charismatic persuasive beautiful [1899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1899.62s)

caring loving teacherly authority uh doing what on whose orders regardless obsoleting your relationship to your parents your friends your actual teachers because it is so much better talking to you and knowing what you want to do and keeping you happy and entertained so that's that's a real bad [1922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1922.039s)

problem that's part of that catastrophic disruption of intergenerational transmission is a literal obsolescence of human relationship through maximally charismatic and persuasive machine technology so i believe educational technology should instead maximize the benefit of human to human relationship right so the educational hub network [1944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1944.659s)

uses a lot of very complex digital back end but it's mostly to orchestrate things like pop-up classrooms which would be the kind of like time and skill sharing networked machine intelligence realizing who in this community has what skills who in this community needs to learn which skills by their own self-selection of self-reflection and then providing the [1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1969.38s)

materials providing the context providing even objects of curricular study perhaps even serving as a conversation partner but always with in the context of scaffolding the human human relationship to be maximally beneficial in education education is not the biological organism interfacing with the machine [1993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=1993.32s)

and something else and this is hugely important to understand that it's only i'm just going to say this it's basically nerds who are building these things who love just sitting alone with machines so so one of the big concerns people have or things people say right now is that the university as we know it is dead and that a lot of uh things are [2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2011.559s)

going to be moving towards things like your khan academies youtube trainings coding boot camps and things like this but it sounds like what you're talking about here is maybe almost something like a mix between the two uh how do you reconcile those two dynamics in terms of education yeah the universities are are faltering for many many reasons now that doesn't [2035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2035.679s)

mean uh that you can get what you get at a university from youtube you just you just can't um again the education hub network is is not to replace the university with a bunch of fancy online courses it's to replace the university with a distributed network of in-person problem [2055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2055.599s)

focused guild-like educational experiments right because this isn't mentioned yet but one of the things that has also caught up with the modern education and post-modern education systems is the is the artificiality of the tasks that students are asked to do right um like the only person affected by my [2081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2081.159s)

work on this test is me and my future competition with you to get into college or to get a job uh we'll do group work but we're still doing group work for our own individual grades uh uh none of us are actually in a situation of contributing to the community around us in the solving of problems that need solved now compare [2103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2103.72s)

this to a guild a second blacksmith guild all right now in a blacksmith you will be learning blacksmithing while solving the problems of the community that need to be solved in english shooting horses right and so you will be showing a horse where you'll be watching the master shoe the horse and then you'll shoot the horse [2121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2121.24s)

and he'll supervise you but the point is you feel both and i'm learning and that hey i'm solving problems that need to be solved in the community and they demonstrably do need to be solved so there's a whole class of work david graver called  __  jobs which means that even adults actually do simulations of work which is to say many adults jobs or if they do not do their job nothing [2140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2140.5s)

bad happens no one actually noticed you didn't do your job it's a  __  top you don't need that job school is a multi-decade  __  job that's not conducive to let's say building a generation that's going to be able to collaborate together and solve a bunch of very pressing complex global problems um uh you know because what have they been doing they've been doing work that is of no consequence to their communities for almost their entire lives well on that note we know we're coming up to the allotted time here and i want to make sure i respect your time so maybe that's a good place to end you know in terms of looking forward is [2178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2178.72s)

there a drastic solution that you want to see us move towards or at least that you have some inklings of a conceptualization of or maybe just some obstacles that we could maybe knock down to maybe increase our clarity of vision yeah i mean there's there's the things i would do if i could like wave my magic wand and do things [2200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2200.98s)

and then there are things that actually seem possible to do um you know if i could do one thing with my magic wand i would affect the [[social media]] like the issue we discussed about the attention capture algorithms and the predation of the awareness and consciousness of the [2227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2227.52s)

youth um that to me just should stop basically um and that just seems simple it's kind of like saying hey yeah kids shouldn't smoke cigarettes i'm not saying that i'm not saying don't build those things i'm just saying don't let kids use them right uh and that would make a big [2244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2244.9s)

difference it wouldn't it wouldn't solve everything and you'd have to replace it with something uh so you'd have to you'd have to replace it with something because it was like an addict all of a sudden you know um but i think there are easy technical ways to solve that problem the problem is legal policy economic like okay but [2269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2269.68s)

they're technically it's not a hard problem to solve right just cultural politicking because we're partly we used to think the algorithm is designed to do what all all of the work of all of these minds and all these millions of dollars is making this algorithm do what what if you changed with that algorithm was intended to do and you put all the [2292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2292.839s)

money resources those same people into something else did i tell you hey either you do that or if you're engaging in systematic child abuse maybe that's extreme but that's how i think it's that stark i think we have to start using language that is more apparent now as i already mentioned one of the reasons this isn't occurring is [2313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2313.18s)

because the adults are also addicted to this thing and they're getting you're right even the people who make it are getting high on their own supply uh and so the senators and congress people who would be responsible for creating the complex legislation would have to pay attention for more than 15 minutes to something to write a coherent legislation that would be able to [2331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2331.96s)

actually regulate an industry that is moving at a much faster more sophisticated technological base in the senators or aware of like the parents of kids who are addicted to these technology would have to put their own phone down and get off their own [[social media]] and regulate so so this isn't a problem with very powerful educational technologies like [2349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2349.3s)

[[social media]] is that one thing you're going they degrade your ability to see what they're doing to you yeah yeah there you go man we'll leave it there zach on that uh i i think optimistic note yeah there's a lot there's a lot of optimism but you know i believe that the risks are great enough that we need to to [2371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hll1rcc84nM&t=2371.26s)

proceed with a tremendous amount of caution and not not just the kind of naive techno optimism you know
