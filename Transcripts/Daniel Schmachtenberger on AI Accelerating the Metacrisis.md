human intelligence unbound by wisdom it is fair to say is the cause of the [[metacrisis]] and the growth imperative of the [[superorganism]] or the capacity that gives rise to it that intelligence has created all the technologies the industrial tech the agricultural tech the digital tech the [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] the energy harvesting the all of it that intelligence has [26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=26.039s)

created all those things it has made the system of capitalism it made the system communism although all of those things right and um now that system of intelligence it takes corporeal capacities things that a body could do and externalizes them the way that a fist can get extended through a hammer or a grip can get extended [47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=47.7s)

through a plier or an eye can get extended through a microscope or a telescope um or our own metabolism can get extended through an internal combustion engine or there are musculature or whatever it is right so it takes the corporeal capacity and extends the out of it extracorporeally so that type of intelligence that does that is now [67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=67.26s)

having the extra corporeal technology be that type of intelligence itself in maximize recursion not bound by wisdom driven by international multipolar military traps and markets and narrow short-term goals at the expense of long-term wide values so where in the [[metacrisis]] there are many risks synthetic biology can make bad pandemics and extreme weather events can drive human migration in local wars and this kind of weapon can do this and this kind of mining can cause us pollution and this kind of pesticide can kill these animals those are all risks within the [[metacrisis]] ai is not a risk within the [[metacrisis]] it is an accelerant to all of them [121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=121.079s)

as used by the choice making architectures that are currently driving the [[metacrisis]] if we weren't in the [[metacrisis]] if we had different choice making architectures we'd be using ai for different things but if ai is in service of human goals and human goals have driven the [[superorganism]] and the [[metacrisis]] the way they are then this context of human goals as an accelerant [141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=141.239s)

of them all now if i think about agi risk let's make we we make an ai that is fully autonomous we can't pull the plug it has goals that aren't ours it starts optimizing for those and then the process decides to use all the atoms for something else and completely terraforms the earth right which it could do it could totally do and we're moving way faster towards that than we are towards [162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=162.239s)

safety on that that is a risk within the [[metacrisis]] landscape but ai being used by all types of militaries all types of governments all types of corporations for all types of purposes achieving narrow goals externalizing harm to wide goals is an accelerant of the [[metacrisis]] on every dimension and so now as we take the intelligence [182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=182.819s)

that has driven these problems unbound by wisdom and we exponentialize that kind of intelligence we get to see whoa super intelligence is really potent what goals are worth optimizing with that much power with something that's a trillion trillion times smarter and faster than humans what goals are worth optimizing it's not global gdp [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=206.7s)

because i can increase gdp with war and addiction and all all kinds of things and destroy the environment every definition and any so i say okay it's gdp plus genie coefficient plus this other thing plus carbon plus whatever nope there's still lots of life that matters outside of those 10 metrics or 100 metrics that i can damage to improve those the metric set that is definable [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=228.54s)

like the doubt itching says the dow that is speakable in words is not the eternal doubt the metric set that is definable is not the right metric set so if i keep expanding the metric set to be gdp plus dot dot dot i can still do a weighted optimization with an ai on this and destroy life and the unknown unknown means there will [251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=251.58s)

always be stuff that matters that has to be pulled in where i don't want to run optimization on this thing so then the question comes if i have something that can optimize so powerfully what is the right thing to guide that it's the thing that can identify the difference between the set of metrics you've identified as important in reality itself [271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=271.199s)

the limits of your own models that is not intelligence that is wisdom i'm defining these roughly in a way that you get the someone gets the sense of the difference between what the weighted metric set of all the identified important metrics and the optimization function on it says you should do the difference between that and what you should actually do is wisdom and it [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=293.759s)

requires being able to attune to more than just the known metrics and more than just the optimization and logic process on those and so as super intelligence shows us how dangerous narrow optimization is it even shows us our own intelligence and our own intelligence running across all the humans via things like markets that and the market [319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=319.44s)

incentivizes some humans to innovate new ways to turn the world into dollars and other humans to um take those innovations and exploit the out of them right so you both search algorithms and optimization algorithms the market makes the general intelligence of humans do those in groups so the cybernetic intelligence of corporations and [[nation state|nation states]] in the world as a whole is already a general autonomous super intelligence running on all the humans as general intelligence is rather than running on cpus but also using all the cpus and tpus and gpus in service of the collection of all the narrow goals so ai accelerates the [[metacrisis]] but it also makes clear to us that what it [365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=365.759s)

would take to align it is you cannot have and this is why the question you asked who's building it and who owns it and what goals do those groups have if you wanted to make a super intelligence that was aligned with the thriving of all life and perpetuity the group that was building it would have to have the goal of the thriving of all life in perpetuity which [385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMozC3zNH4&t=385.319s)
