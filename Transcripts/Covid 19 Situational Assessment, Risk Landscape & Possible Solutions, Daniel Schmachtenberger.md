music so daniel thank you for joining me i know you've been hugely busy over the last few days you're probably a familiar face to many people on the channel and maybe people aren't aware that you've been deeply involved with the response to this pandemic from the medical side from the economic side liaison with institutions and agencies and we we're going to cover here like the situational [27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=27.81s)

assessments where are we at right now and what is the really crucial information that people need to know and act on right now yeah thank you david so we are recording on march 21st i'm saying that because we're going to be giving a real-time assessment and also recommendations and many of these recommendations will have already happened and will be on to new [58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=58.05s)

things and the assessment will have changed a few days from now so much of this information is rapidly changing also as a preface not a medical doctor so i'm not giving medical advice here i am working with a number of groups seeking to get good information and good response across us so as a source of preface we'll start with a kind of situation assessment and then what a [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=86.52s)

risk assessment of how the situation could have full unfold based on unknowns and different response types would be and then response recommendations and then some brief notes on the background situation that has brought us here and what the kind of bigger picture responses need to be for systemic fragility and [[catastrophic risk]] writ large i'll start with just a quick note [113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=113.64s)

on the nature of bias and assessing things like this because most everyone has seen a range of responses from this is no big deal it's just a flu - this is the end of the world as we know it and so obviously most of those responses are not particularly clearly informed but even amongst the clearly informed things the curves can be very different based on how we respond and [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=151.98s)

there's a lot of unknown still we don't know if getting the infection and recovering will confer immunity - where you don't get it again or if you don't get it for across what range of changes in mutation so given that there's also a lot of unknowns including confounding variables that could occur you do get a pretty wide range of estimates so i'm gonna speak to in the risk assessment [177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=177.93s)

some of the things that could go pretty badly if we don't respond well not because that is definitely how it's going to go but because it could go that way if we don't respond preventatively now this is a tricky thing anytime someone is in the position of trying to do an anticipatory response is that it is the job in doing anticipatory risk mitigation to assess the scenarios we [201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=201.18s)

don't want to have happen to propose remedies to prevent them from happening then people who have status quo bias afterwards will say see it was overblown hype those things didn't happen but they only didn't happen because we made the responses so the the scenarios i'm gonna suggest hopefully don't happen but they could and in order to not happen they need us to take them seriously and [226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=226.38s)

respond in a way that prevents them and then after the fact we'll say see look they didn't happen because we responded well so this is a really key aspect of bias that's important now we have a situation where we have to act without complete knowledge the time that it takes to get complete knowledge the underlying situation is changing so inaction is also a kind of action right [247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=247.08s)

there is a consequence to action and inaction and the action is not inconsequential no matter what doing nationwide quarantines has an a massive effect on people's mental health on the underlying economy on lots of things and not doing it has a massive effect and so we're not taking any of that trivially trivially what we're gonna do is given what the unknowns are [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=273.34s)

and what the knowns are what are the various scenarios factoring the second and third and fourth order effects how bad do they get and what are the responsible approaches to take that maintain optionality for us to continue to make better responses as we get better information and as we get better capabilities that's it for the preface so diving into situational assessment i [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=296.979s)

think many people have a clearer sense of the real risk here than they had even a couple days ago because the awareness of the actual risk portended is getting clearer in terms of obviously the us government and the uk government starting to change their position the paper that came out from the imperial college affected the positions of both of those countries from let's just kind [332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=332.26s)

of let everybody get it herd immunity type approaches to oath that actually it's gonna be catastrophic and won't work and we have to be serious about social distancing and quarantine there are still a lot of people who think that the risk of quarantine is worse than the risk of not and that the viral risk itself is overblown and that's one of the things that i want to address so [359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=359.139s)

we'll start right there so comparing the death rates to the flu and seeing that a lot less people have died and then thinking that it's overblown and it's some kind of either state agenda to concentrate control or mass hysteria or something like that a number of people that die from the flu every year is one it's a baseline that we always have so looking at elevation from [386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=386.66s)

baseline is a critical factor because that's changing a the way that society functions - because it's a baseline we've had every year we have icu capability for that we don't have icu capability for spikes above that and that's where we start getting catastrophic collapse of the medical system that leads to much worse problems 3 during a flu season most people get it [408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=408.729s)

very high percentage people get it because we don't try to stop the spread because it's not that fatal not not that high a percentage of total people died not that high percentage of people even need hospitalized so we don't take very serious measures to prevent it spread so if a similar number of people got kove in nineteen as got the flu the death numbers would be catastrophic higher [435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=435.8s)

because the percentage of people that need hospitalized and go into critical condition and the percentage of people that died even factoring the whole range of what that can be is radically higher the total number of people exposed so far is tiny compared to the flu but it won't stay tiny if you don't do containment it is spreading enough that if you don't contain it [458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=458.12s)

you could get saturation you'd get saturation in about two months meaning a 60 70 percent of the population has it globally from where we currently are if containment efforts didn't get put in place containment efforts can of course slow that curve and even stop the curve depending upon the nature of the containment which will make the total number of infected people and thus [480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=480.169s)

hospitalized people and deaths much much lower also in calculating fatalities it takes a while from the time that someone is exposed for them to expose other people and expose other people to get to who the people who are going to be most vulnerable it takes a while from the time someone was exposed for them to show symptoms from the time they show symptoms to get serious enough to go to [502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=502.49s)

the hospital and from the time they go to the hospital to when they die so there's a lot of people who are early in that curve who are not yet being recorded as fatalities but will and so comparing the fatalities right now to the flu is like a whole bunch of statistical mistakes at once that's just one important thing to factor if if you got two that say 60 70 [529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=529.37s)

percent infection rate as you get with the flu what just a comparison what would the death rate be there's a few numbers that really matter it are not in cf are the two then most people are focusing or not as each person that gets it how many other people will get it from them and cfr's case fatality rate of the total people who are infected how many died the other number that i think [553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=553.76s)

is critically important that is not quite as popular being tracked is of the total number of people who get it how many need hospitalized how many have to go to icu that ends up being really critical because of the much larger percentage that are hospitalized than died the downstream effects of that are very profound and they have to factor them all three of those numbers are [580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=580.19s)

variables they are not fixed just by the nature of the virus themselves so they're very affected by the social response social and institutional response so regarding the are not number when we say the are not is two or two-and-a-half or whatever it is this is a statistical average first it's a guess based on not knowing the actual number of infected cases because we aren't [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=607.279s)

testing enough to know the actual number of infected cases and it's an average across people who stay at home and don't interact with anyone and people who are writing the subway and interacting with everyone and are in a lot of contact and would be what we call super spreaders so someone might infect a thousand people and someone else might infect no people right so averages are very misleading [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=629.0s)

because someone can say okay two and a half people for me but particularly young healthy people who don't think they're at risk of dying and so they're like i can take a risk of getting this more than i can fake the risk of missing making money or whatever is might continue to and especially if they stay because of being relatively healthy low symptom for a very long [653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=653.41s)

period of time while being infectious they could be super spreaders to a lot of people so it's important oh the other thing with regard to or not that we have to understand is it's so obviously that's averaged and some people will spread much more than others but also this topic of portal pathways being able to spread it to a critically sensitive community or spread it to other people [678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=678.339s)

who will become super spreaders or who would have otherwise been unaffected so it's not it's not just like how many people did you spread it to but did you spread it somewhere that actually is a really big deal getting there versus not getting there so for instance vulnerable populations like senior living facilities the death rate is also averaged across populations who mostly [702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=702.339s)

all won't die versus that have very high mortality rates so the mortality rate and a senior care facility of people who are both older and have comorbidities is extremely high and so let's say one of the workers who's going in there whether it is a nurse or a janitor or whatever is infected they don't know that they're infected because there's not enough testing they're asymptomatic it spreads [727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=727.149s)

in there the fatality can that workers from that would be very profound if a worker goes into a prison or into a homeless facility or into doing social care work in skid row in a major homeless area if those areas could be totally quarantined right now and protected from getting in we'd be much much better off because if they get it it's extraordinarily hard to prevent it [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=761.079s)

from spreading and when we already don't have enough intubation equipment and icu capabilities those aren't the first places it's going to go so we have to factor not just super spreaders but portal pathways research patient 31 in south korea south korea basically had contained and one person who wasn't contained was in lots of social connection and all of the other cases [786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=786.55s)

that happen they're believed to have occurred from that one person so yeah this is a place where we're not just factoring ourselves we're factoring the spread and the civic responsibility associated with it so the infection rate is a massive variable and we can change it that's the first thing the number of people or the percentage of people who get infected who have to go to the [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=812.62s)

hospital is a massive variable and who died it's a massive variable so we see that the death rate the fatality rate and none of these numbers are perfect because this is total cases in ratio to the death cases but we don't have total cases right anywhere because we're not doing enough testing anywhere and the countries aren't doing similar types and amounts of testing so the statistics are [838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=838.18s)

getting misleading but it looks like the best numbers or say in south korea and the worst numbers or say in iran or italy in terms of fatality so south korea's got like a point five percent fatality of the total number of people to get it less than half a percent or around a half a percent maybe up to about a percent die whereas you might have like five six seven percent [861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=861.55s)

depending upon how we factor the statistics dying in some other places partly this is going to have to do with the susceptibility of the communities that are getting hit obviously seattle had a very high case fatality rate because it had senior from a senior home to begin with right so that's going to start high but it's also very much the result of the response so if you do [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=886.3s)

early diagnostics not only can you do smart containment and prevent the spread you can start early treatment and early treatment means that the chance of severe infection is going to go down radically so this is a novel virus meaning it's not a previous human virus and so we don't have innate immunity to it and we don't already have developed either vaccines or drug treat [913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=913.66s)

but we're obviously the whole world is mobilizing on its learning curve as fast as possible so it was found out that chloroquine seems effective hydroxychloroquine seems more effective with less side effects the hydroxychloroquine is a thorough myosin combo is looking quite effective but it's not inconsequential there's retinopathy effects there's heart [934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=934.799s)

effects so there's also limited supply of hydroxychloroquine there's already people who depend upon that med to live who have lupus who are having a hard time getting in which then starts to cause death from other reasons right or um not just death but hospitalization and health issues and whatever there's research being done on lots of antivirals that are looking promising [960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=960.299s)

and on cytokine inhibitors and on ace - modulators on plasma antibody transfers so i don't think the world has ever had a situation where we medically learned as fast as is happening now this is another reason to want to slow the curve radically because we are much less well prepared today than we will be each day that passes for dealing with us as we're learning more but already a lot of [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=984.989s)

doctors are treating with hydroxychloroquine and as a thorough myosin and other things like that and even just getting on fluids and but let's say that you get a treat with those drugs early on most of those people won't have to go to the icu even the same people that would have had to go to the icu otherwise and many of the people that will have to go to the [1006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1006.769s)

hospital won't need intubated and won't die and so early diagnostics and early treatment also change the curve of the illness for people who do get infected also early diagnostics changes the curve of how many other people they in fact right so you can have a situation where a very high percentage of the total population who gets infected will end up having to go to the icu right like 20% [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1033.35s)

of the population you could have a situation where almost nobody has to go to the icu because we're testing of aquit ously and getting good treatments to people so it's important to understand how variable that is and the same with death rates it is not true that this is only a serious illness for old people with comorbidities it is mostly only fatal [1054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1054.679s)

for people who are older or have comorbidities so far but half of the people in italy who are on intubation which means a tube in your lungs keeping you alive are under 60 half of them are and if they didn't have access to that equipment then they wouldn't stay alive many of them and so it's important to understand that part of why the fatality rates are lower is because they're [1081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1081.44s)

depending upon life support systems that if those life support systems went out the fatality would go way up now italy's already gone to this situation where they don't have enough respirators and icu capability for everyone so there triaging and so some people are just being led to die because they don't have any other options so then the death percentage goes way up [1099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1099.74s)

right that's the single biggest thing that affects the percentage of people that die is the overwhelm of icu capabilities and then people can't get treated for coronavirus and so they die also you can have a situation where the hospital is overwhelmed so people can't get treated for the normal stuff where we save people's lives from heart attacks and strokes and ambulances are [1121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1121.28s)

taking a long time to get to places and bleeding looms and all those other things so it's important to understand that all of those numbers regarding the spread of the infection the number of people to get hospitalized the number of people that die are all variable we can change all of them and the recommendations we're going to share or how to make those numbers lower but [1143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1143.24s)

those numbers can all go radically high if we don't respond appropriately we could have a spread all the way to saturation we could overwhelm the icu ziff where we will if that happens the death rate goes very high that's not to mention yet what the follow-on effects on the infrastructure and [[national security]] and the economy and other things will be but just even factoring [1163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1163.34s)

that so now should we get into secondary effects sure yep so this much has not been clear to everyone it's still not clear to everyone but it's starting to get clearer and you had someone on the other day who's written some really brilliant articles on these things po a said his name thomas boy oh yes oh yeah yeah read his articles they're very good and you [1190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1190.269s)

know that kind of information is starting to get clearer the next step we have to look at is let's say that we look at the health effects on people as first order effects these are the virus direct action first actually before i get to second-order effects let's address some of the unknowns here we'll immunity be conferred don't know and so as far as herd immunity type questions [1221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1221.08s)

we do not know enough to be able to make those assessments yet because and so again this is as of march 21st a few days from now we might know more there are cases injured in china and japan of people who were diagnosed with kovat 19 who got better and then who got it again did they for sure get all the way better and then got reinfected exhaustion ously or did they not get rid of the virus all [1251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1251.2s)

the way and then it recirculated in their system or was the secondary exposure some other thing like a normal flu or whatever we don't know yet it's not clear enough also there are antibody responses for the people who are getting sick and then getting better but what is that antibody response actually going to do what is it priming we also just don't know yet so it's could it is the [1277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1277.269s)

antibody response such that next time someone is exposed to the virus even in high viral load they'll get no symptoms at all their body will fight it off so quickly they get no symptoms maybe they'll be awesome do they get symptoms but less severely because their body fights it quicker or do they actually get a worse case because people actually die from the immune response right they [1297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1297.07s)

die from a cytokine storm from the inflammatory response that happens it ends up overwhelming the lungs and other other organs so interleukin 6 primarily in tnf alpha there's drugs that are working to block those but could that the antibody response prime's a cytokine storm that's been speculated just don't know yet because we don't have a lot of people who've gotten [1318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1318.68s)

better and we know they got better we've tested that there's zero viral load and then they reexpose then let's say that someone does have immunity will everyone have the same immunity or will it be that people who have more compromised immune systems or primed for cytokine storm and other people are primed to actually have good responses there's probably going to be a gaussian [1339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1339.86s)

distribution of the type of response that occurs or there could very well be right the next question is how long will the immunity last will it last for a couple years which would be really helpful as it didn't sars or is the mutation such that the antibodies last only for a couple months in which case this thing keeps circulating we don't know again we don't have that kind of [1361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1361.88s)

long-term data the other thing is that the virus is mutating and how wide of a mutation will the antibodies protect against even if they are protective is a question right so as we know with the spanish flu situation it wasn't the first round that killed the most people it was the second round so let's even say we got hurt immunity we know that we don't get hurt immunity [1385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1385.27s)

against the flu permanently it every year kills a bunch more people right and we know that even if we vaccinate against that the vaccine is not good against the mutation so we have a similar situation here let's say that we didn't control this adequately and it's with us every year like the flu now but on top of the flu but with a much higher fatality and it reaches saturation [1406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1406.94s)

numbers then we could look at this being a meaningfully population decreasing phenomena so let's say you get to saturation 70% of the people are infected and 2% of them die or because 70% are infected and it overwhelms the ic use 5% of the people die calculate those on country-by-country basis or global basis those are tremendously huge numbers right so that's a there are [1435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1435.11s)

numbers like 1 million there's numbers like 10 million in the us based on exactly how what the death rates are and how those curves happen but there i think the number of soldiers that died in vietnam over 11 years was 50,000 or something like that so you can look at the multiples we're looking at so we don't yet know about whether immunity will be [1460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1460.86s)

adequately conferred we don't yet know about the rate and the severity of the mutations and if the following mutations will be more or less lethal we don't yet know what the long-term health effects of contracting this are so we know that viruses don't just go away permanently in many cases they go into chronic phases so someone gets her peas and they can continue to get herpes right they [1490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1490.169s)

get hpv warts and they can continue to get words and they can continue to become infectious when that happens we know that with other infections you get chickenpox you don't get again for a long time but then you get shingles and then for some things like say mono then you still have low-grade epstein-barr that can increase likelihoods for cancers and chronic fatigue syndrome and [1513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1513.75s)

things like that so what are is is there going to be a chronic health implication of this in addition to the existing chronic viruses that are already part of the health care system this is again also a totally not known topic and then the people who get a serious illness but don't die the ct scans of their lungs show very serious damage to their lungs some of them are showing damage to the [1542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1542.61s)

heart cardiomyopathy and other body systems so might there be lasting damage it affects the duration of that person's life even for people who and i mean not via the viral or immunological process but the tissue damage processes well we know that tissue damage is occurring of the type that normally is lasting obviously what that looks like two or three years later we don't yet know but [1571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1571.169s)

that should all tell people that this is not something to take lightly and that there's a good bit of unknown also just look at a video of someone on intubation and who's got to be intubated for weeks like that's such an undesirable thing to experience even if it doesn't kill you and again back that half of the people in italy on intubation are under 60 so that's a [1595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1595.89s)

little bit more just on the medical effects right okay so let's say that that is all looking at kind of just the direct virus acting on human physiology so now we look at second-order effects and we say okay so what is the effect on the medical system from spikes well beyond the capacity of what i see use our setup for so it's expensive to run hospitals it's expensive to run [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1624.93s)

intensive care units and to train lots of doctors and whatever to just be sitting around waiting for surges so hospitals and i see use run pretty close to full capacity for financial efficiency which means that really big surges are things that are not well prepared for some things can be upregulated fairly quickly some things can't like it's not very easy to build a [1647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1647.91s)

lot more respirators in a hurry or to train a lot more doctors in a hurry so if the number of people who are going to i see use is within the capacity that the icu can scale up to the death percentages will stay relatively low if it exceeds it and the i see us to start triaging who gets treated and who doesn't the number of deaths the percentage of deaths is going to go way [1672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1672.66s)

up so let's say that the number of people that are going in is 2x what the icu czar prepared for and they can get people in the hallways and whatever okay that's one thing but what if it's 10x or more this is where you start seeing what you're seeing in italy and you know and worse where it's just people just can't be treated now besides the fact that most of the hospitals in the us are [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1698.97s)

already running low on personal protective equipment or don't even have it and doctors are putting themselves and nurses putting themselves a huge personal risk rate of doctors and nurses getting sick is estimated at something like two to five x with the rate of everybody else's and they're the people who most critically can't get sick and there's [1716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1716.47s)

not enough icu beds there's not enough intubation equipment there's not enough of the tests of the hydroxychloroquine of whatever right very since doctor friend of mine in la told me something like currently there's a hundred and fifty beds and icu left in la there's 10 million people in la and let's just look at what any percentage of saturation looks like and what any reasonable [1745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1745.06s)

percentage of that having to go to icu is and it's like oh that that can look terrible in a hurry ring so what happens if our doctors and nurses are getting sick and we saw a couple thousand health care workers and china gets that grade and china did a good job of containing it to one area which we haven't we now have cases in all 50 states they were able to mostly quarantine hubei province [1771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1771.43s)

and wuhan and have the spread outside much less but because of their drastic rapid intense response and also even if the doctors and nurses don't get sick just wearing them out because they're trying to save lives running so many shifts go look at the videos of people in icu in seattle in italy and just kind of get a sense of what that looks like and read some of the letters that [1800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1800.77s)

doctors in italy are writing that are kind of sharing their experience so you start to have a collapse of the health care system and now this has all kinds of cascading consequences for death from all other kinds of things and chronic health implications and whatever alright next so let's say we try to institute a quarantine and people don't want to participate and so we have to have the [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1833.71s)

national guard and the police we're allowed to try to initiate it if you look at the videos from south korea and china and hong kong you'll see that the police and the national guard equivalents are all wearing hazmat gear and the doctors and the nurses and the people doing the sanitizing and picking up the trash are all in pretty intensive degrees of [1854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1854.51s)

personal protective equipment and the very frontline high exposure ones are in hazmat gear to the best of my knowledge and pretty active communication about this neither the u.s. nor the uk have that much gear nor do they have the training to be able to get that to the frontline people that would need to have it so obviously we have to find where the surplus is get it to the most [1879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1879.56s)

critical people in triage get the training up and produce more kind of instantly because one of the things you'll notice about many of those jobs is that they have very high contact with each other right police are riding in a truck together they're in a locker room together national guard etc first responders and because of the long asymptomatic period [1900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1900.34s)

2 to 21 days asymptomatic and some cases actually recover while being quite low symptoms so you can be spreading that entire time and we don't have you know testing out so what happens if a significant percentage of the police start to get sick or the national guard or military or prison guards or the people who run the utilities the critical utilities or the [[supply chain|supply chains]] you can start to get now here's the cascading kind of third order failures and these are much much worse risks than the virus right so obviously everyone can't go on quarantine because for most people to be able to stay home the electricity has to stay on and the water has to stay on the internet has to stay on they have to have some way that either the supermarket's have some [1949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=1949.24s)

triage version of staying open or delivery mechanisms happen the pharmacies so there's a number of people whose jobs are required to basically mediate societal function and not having societal collapse all of those people need to get personal protective equipment and/or hazmat gear based on the degree of exposure they have and they need to get training for how to use it and they need to have in sherman of payments so they don't go on strike this is not the time we need or trash the people that do trash sanitization engineers getting sick or going on strike right we're then you start to get additional health plague type issues associated trash piling up or any critical utilities or whatever starting to have [2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2000.48s)

problems but that could happen right and we already see we saw in italy certain prisons being overtaken by the prisoners because of this situation either because the prison guards didn't want to go to work or about sick or various things like that now the us has a much higher percentage of its total population in prison than any other country the prisons are going to be highly [2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2023.07s)

vulnerable to the spread if it happens inside of there and they know they won't be the first people to get intubated so what does that mean for the mindset of you know people in there these are just these are serious follow-on effects that really have to be thought about and in addressed anticipatorily now we also have confounding effects which are independent variables but that also [2045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2045.72s)

affect the overall situation the floods are starting in the us and that's a normal thing we get floods in the rainy season but how do the droplets of this disease spread and water scenarios where everybody's walking around in ankle-deep or knee-deep water how do you do containment and quarantine when you're having to move people because of floods how does that affect [2071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2071.04s)

the redirection of medical and first responders you know those types of things right we also had a little earthquake in utah that was just a wake up of like oh the rest of the normal disasters don't go on and hold so you know as we come in the summer and we think about what california's wildfire season was like last year and think about okay so what happens where you got [2094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2094.98s)

a quarantine then the wildfire start or florida hurricane season or whatever right so we also have to think about the rest of general preparedness in those issues and where we started to get quarantined down and now we lose quarantine because of some other issue and or can't respond so we get worse death tolls or infrastructure collapse because our responders are already [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2118.65s)

purposed somewhere else for sick or taxed or something like that right now we start to look at the political effects could we have a situation where the countries on quarantine during the elections for the us yeah do we have digital voting that is secure and ready to go where people can vote from at home no not currently and what it would take to get there [2146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2146.369s)

we have no precedent for we also have no precedent for a plague you know a pandemic during voting if we get if to ensure that people go and vote do we increase the pandemic spread and have a spike during that time and then you know have a whole additional spike to deal with does this change the demographics of who's available to go significantly so there's a whole big serious set of [2171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2171.329s)

questions there obviously the economic situation we've seen trillions of dollars of loss since this is started in the stock market and if you take for the us or the uk or any country or the world you take the gdp per month and you say okay under quarantine people are staying home we're not just looking at a effective asset classes because of trading and fear and whatever and we're [2202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2202.319s)

not just looking at the effect of on airlines and a few industries but all of the restaurants and all of the you know sporting and cruises and in-person type things small businesses everything under quarantine so we're looking at not just a effect on the financial sector but on the actual real economics of productivity itself and supply and demand type dynamics themselves so then [2230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2230.549s)

we get what a decrease of by 30 percent under quarantine or forty percent or whatever of world gdp capacity so look at what the gdp of the us for instance per montes look at losing 30 or 40 percent of that per month and the idea that that's what has to be subsidized just for break-even type effects not mentioning the up ramping i see use capabilities and [2253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2253.92s)

diagnostic capabilities and things like that or international aid which brings us to the next topic there's a lot more in economics by the way seventy percent of americans live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to be quarantined for a while so they will push to want to keep working and you know spread infection for them to be able to stay home is gonna require economic support in [2275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2275.609s)

stimulus packages which are already in discussion which is really good which should be suspension of rent and mortgage payments and either a ubi or some kind of food and medicine provisioning type capabilities there's going to need to be protection for small businesses so there doesn't have to be massive laying off of people because if you have bankruptcy and collapse of [2299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2299.369s)

small businesses they can't rebuild themselves that quickly there's a learning group to be able to rebuild things so it's like you know when you're clear cut a forest you don't get a new forest back right away and so there's a lot in the economic space that has to be addressed the geopolitical space is actually where my biggest concerns are so i'll share a scenario it's not the [2324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2324.289s)

only scenario so we see already saudi arabia doing and russia in this you know oil price gouging kind of scenario and that could play out all kinds of weird ways so there's lots of different scenarios that could occur but let's specifically focus on us-china relations and overall geopolitical placement first let's look at what the epidemiology for the whole world could be because we [2351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2351.27s)

don't know originally there was a hope that this would follow seasonality and either led up a bunch in the summer and or as a result of temperature effects not really hit one countries as much we now see it spreading rapidly in brazil and in other warmer asian places and so that hope has been kind of thwarted it looks like there are aren't any places that are [2376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2376.869s)

unsusceptible so there are places that are earlier in the curve and later in the curve in some place that haven't been reached yet but unless some kind of massive measures are taken to not be reached and they will so specifically what happens when india gets hit china has a huge population but they didn't have to quarantine their whole population they had to do some measures [2400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2400.0s)

across the whole population but they were able to contain to a province pretty strongly what is india do with very high total population very high population density very high interaction low icu per capita capabilities low relative hygiene capabilities for lots of population and just imagine like okay if we don't protect against transmission there what [2423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2423.91s)

happens same with mexico city right same with lagos same with a number of places bangladesh that have high populations multiplied by population density without good preparedness capacities okay so now we see and we see that first world countries are getting destroyed right we see that italy is in that position and and that other european countries right merkel said probably 70 percent of the [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2451.96s)

country is going to get infected eventually like the very serious kinds of things we see what's happening to the eu as a result of this since they use not actually supporting italy and not able to support eastern european countries and then china stepping in to offer help so now china was on the front of this curve which also and they took very strong responses so they are the [2473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2473.529s)

farthest ahead of being able to offer international aid in response china was already the place that did most of the manufacturing of medical equipment in the first place and so in one way of looking at it and china got a massive economic hit and there were lots of companies that wanted to pull manufacturing out of china which could be a massive very long term head for [2498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2498.819s)

china since exporters such a huge part of their business it affected overall you know public sentiment towards them so in some ways they got hit hard but on other ways you know it's just two months later and they're starting to loosen quarantine no new cases in wuhan and they're opening apple stores and starbucks stores throughout the country again right plus [2522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2522.54s)

offering masks and ventilators and training and aid and you know medical knowledge and equipment to places that need it so we've seen that in italy we've seen in some eastern european places we saw to the eu as a whole so in some ways china's in a stronger position than it's ever been because they're on the other side of this they mobilized into a crisis wartime response type mode [2550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2550.17s)

and they have the medical response equipment and those types of things they were already geopolitically very savvy with the belden road initiative and all of the work they were doing to be able to get international support and coordination for their geopolitical agendas the u.s. appears to be moving into one of the weakest positions it has been in a very long time and because of [2573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2573.21s)

not having early strong response and we can't just do specialized quarantines because there are some people in all 50 states and we don't have the diagnostics ready could we be in a very vulnerable position for a long time i've heard uk and us federal governments both talked about 18 months now after the paper that came out from imperial college talking about that so what happens if china is [2595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2595.079s)

in a very strong position yes in a weak position and could they start dumping us treasury bonds could they start with cyberattacks whatever not just them lots of state actors non-state actors right do we have if the police are redirected then where does that open up criminality if the government's attention is damaged or redirected where does that open up vulnerabilities that's obviously going [2622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2622.47s)

to happen everywhere but there's not as many places in the world that would have predatory opportunism for italy as they'd have for the us right or the uk but particularly look at kind of superpower tensions here and but there's a thing that isn't direct war which is just china being able to do a good job of offering international aid in exchange for joining the belden road [2651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2651.63s)

initiative and then oh by the way dollars are really dirty and transmitted coronavirus let's move to digital currency oh by the way we have a digital currency let's roll it out and or you can only get our aid in the digital currency or that was already something that was being considered and in the works i was a turn on to this originally by alex gladstein from the human rights [2673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2673.589s)

foundation that there's a bunch of countries that were already too fully dependent upon chinese infrastructure like being the only telecom in many countries and obviously the kind of predatory debt lending for fundamental infrastructure where they could say we will now only accept payment and all you need payment portal but because it's a government-sponsored digital payments [2697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2697.589s)

there's no anonymity to the money at all right so there's there's no separation between the private sector and the public sector there's no anonymous cash there's a perfectly monitor of all financial surveillance apparatus that would also become a world currency world reserve currency if it became the primary one used or couldn't so i want the u.s. to ramp up its capability to [2721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2721.949s)

respond to this domestically and to shore up its vulnerabilities against all of the kinds of [[national security]] threats and tax on whatever that can happen during this time and ramp up its ability to start offering international aid i would like the uk and the us department and you know for everyone else who would be in the right place due to a partner in that and we're nowhere [2745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2745.65s)

close to that but we could it would require a world war two level mobilization full-court press on the capability to do it we see that the private sectors offered involvement already we see the china's private sector has right and so jack ma saying that he'll get the personal protective equipment and other key things needed for the us but we also see facebook and google and walmart and walgreens and you know lots of us corporations we see that elon said that he'd ramp up ability to make ventilators if needed i would really like to see capabilities of companies like alongs conscripted to not just ramp up ventilators for the us knee but also to be able to export international aid for [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2793.69s)

the geopolitical position that that represents i also want to be very careful that in in engaging the private sector the companies that are most capable of helping in the private sector the ones that already had too much power and we're almost monopolies so amazon has amazing logistics capabilities to get everything to people's door well they're under quarantine and they were [2816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2816.069s)

already basically became the market right facebook has an amazing ability to do contact tracing where if anyone is infected we can probably see everyone who they were engaged with and be able to help predict where the curves are going to hit the icy use but we don't want to turn those abilities on and then leave them on forever so we have to be able to engage the private sector in a [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2834.67s)

way that engages their capacities but doesn't collapse democracy and have regulatory capture even more as a result of it and data capture which is where we can neither be slow in our response here because of the rate of doubling nor can in our fastness we be hasty and make dumb moves which means extremely smart fast [[sensemaking]] and coordination is absolutely needed so there's a lot more [2859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2859.03s)

examples that we could give we haven't even talked about what the mental health crisis consequences are going to be the change and social fabric are going to be what is the effect of the total number of old people that die on social grieving and family structures what is the a whole generation of kids all missing school at the same time like there's a lot of things to factor here [2883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2883.66s)

how many marriages only stay together because the people avoid each other most of the time and you know i'm quarantined and the kids stay home from school and they have two parents who normally work now one of the masks to stay home and the dad's a utility worker in the nurse and neither of them can stay home and like this all these types of things to consider i mean you've just outlined [2904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2904.23s)

a few of the effects of the of the quarantine so some people might be thinking well is the quarantine worse than the than the disease itself not even close having if herd immunity occurs which we don't know it needs to occur slow and up that it doesn't overwhelm the isee use which means we still have to do everything we can to stop the spike from [2934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2934.829s)

icu overwhelm if the herd immunity doesn't occur all the more we want to stop the icu and stop people from getting it because it doesn't even help to get it and get over with it and we need to be able to ramp up the diagnostics and the early treatments that are going to be able to be the actual longer-term answer losing a bunch of our doctors and nurses having [2958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2958.079s)

collapse of [[critical infrastructure]] having so much national damage that's occurring from the death tolls that we become more vulnerable to attacks of various kinds we've already seen increase in kind of coordinated disinfo attacks that look to be state actor and some non-state actor attacks and cyber attacks no think about it like frame control right from a kind of theory of [2988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=2988.41s)

war placed we would much rather voluntarily quarantine and not and have the people that are needed to run critical stuff still be healthy and able to run the critical stuff then they're sick and they can't and we can't respond if we want to and now we're on the defense of whatever else is coming right so to have frame control of this you absolutely want to be able to respond [3014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3014.66s)

anticipatorily and 18 months of quarantine would be really really bad but two or three months people can live with people like churches need to come together and say we're not gonna come together physically but we're going to make sure that everyone who's lonely is getting talked to on the phone and we're doing skype calls and we're doing you know spiritual psychological support [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3039.39s)

we're making sure that the people who don't have resources and the older vulnerable people are getting the resources we're being used as hubs to you know provision the gear there's there's lots of things that can be done to be able to support so here's the proposal that i recommend that i would like to see happen i would like to see for the us and i i don't know the uk [3061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3061.71s)

situation as well but i believe it's probably quite similar i would like to see a total nationwide quarantine immediately effective immediately and what that means is if you don't have a job that societal function requires you to go out to work for then you stay home so if you run utilities or critical [[supply chain]] or first responder or whatever then you need to get then the [3093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3093.03s)

government has to be able to provision personal protective equipment and hazmat gear and training to all of those people the training is critical because even if you have the gear and you use it the tiniest bit wrong touch the outside of something while you're removing it then it's completely worthless and this is again a situation where the money that was cut to the cdc in office of [3118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3118.56s)

pandemics and like that was really disastrous because we need more of these people to have been trained already and have gear already and to have earlier response capacity and better coordination had we responded early we would have had a recurring kong's right you shut down the borders tend to the first few people that are sick and that's it right then you have a south [3140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3140.97s)

korea type case where a lot of people get infected but you so you can't just kind of prevent anyone getting infected but you respond very strong you do the quarantines you do the personal protective equipment and the sanitizing and the social distancing and you do the very strong diagnostics early on and tracing and you have the curve flatten very steeply [3165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3165.22s)

and it's important understand that south korea is a democracy this isn't day only totalitarian autocracies conclude draconian measures when the draconian measures will seem very humane and sane compared to like tiny little italy italy's the size of not china but the hubei province has already had more people die than china and it's still early in their curve so that actually [3191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3191.619s)

should be seen as radically inhumane to not respond quickly and i mean we're not seeing these responses yet in i mean the uk in the us for example and and generally why do you think that is what do you think it is that people are not getting is it the nature of the [[exponential curve]] or what's what do you think of the blocks right now i think the imperial college piece that came out [3216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3216.849s)

really changed the uk and the u.s. is perspective it seems because they they got oh  __  this isn't the flu this is serious and we collapse of icu looks really ugly and we don't even know about convert immunity so the whole just naive this is not going to be that big a deal or we all need hurt immunity anyways and we'll just call a little bit of the population those are just gibberish [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3240.67s)

ideas and i think that we were running on gibberish ideas there's of course alternate hypotheses about different intentions i don't think that it matters to speculate on that right now i think what matters is to just get appropriate responses and the appropriate response right now is that even though we have people in all 50 states that are infected and but that's not evenly [3267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3267.25s)

distributed we still have 50% of the cases in five or six counties which means that we do have to do a very smart coordinated triage approach where do we get the rate-limiting gear the diagnostics does have to be equal quarantine everywhere no right what does a smart approach look like requires much better coordination and much faster responses than we've had but as is right [3289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3289.93s)

now the total percentage of the population affected is so small right but with a three-day doubling time that changes very quickly and you reach saturation in less than two months now when we say reach saturation like 70% of the population list in two months that's if no measures are instituted we can already see they're being instituted even if not the federal government level [3314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3314.079s)

california just implemented a policy statewide and many cities are implementing at their city level and a lot of people are voluntarily quarantine so we're going to dampen the curve but it needs to be dampened much more radically so why have we not before it's some combination of miscalculating being more afraid of the economic hits and not calculating how bad the economic hits of [3342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3342.569s)

it hitting catastrophic infection levels would be just rampant [[coordination failure]] cut resources to the areas that would normally know how to respond to this appropriately but i don't think i don't want anyone focused on who did what dumb things right now which creates more [[coordination failure]] i want everyone working together in a nonpartisan way to just stop this then [3375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3375.609s)

we can come back to domestic politics of that kind but if we have any kind of red blue left/right nonsense right now lots more people will die and the catastrophic effects will be worse so this needs to be unified response within countries and between countries they're also obviously viruses don't give you  __  about borders they only care about transmission and so that's the other [3400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3400.03s)

thing is that national governments cannot respond to pandemics they can respond but they can't solely respond that requires international coordinated responses i want to see nationwide quarantine it's the only way to stop the spread because the spread is human to human or human to surface to human and if you stop the social transmission it stops it's important to understand the [3426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3426.339s)

that viruses don't care about speeches or politics or economic interests like they're just it's biologists physics and this is one of the things that we you know in in general there's this truism that the generals who are at the top of the military during peacetime are not necessary the ones we're best at winning wars so when we move into wartime sometimes they start losing battles and [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3454.87s)

we kind of have to rotate through a few times till we find people like churchill and patents that are good at winning wars that we wouldn't necessarily want these times because kind of politicians or diplomats i see that happening now where you can for a lot of issues that are just are social constructs speeches and what people think and what they feel and being able to just dope the [3477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3477.61s)

information ecology is adequate because we're just trying to move human sentiment viruses don't give a  __  about that so we're actually dealing with base physics again right and overwhelmed icu doesn't give a  __  about that and [[critical infrastructure]] there's a lot of these things which like oh we're actually dealing with physics again and so doing politics will not [3495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3495.7s)

help them so anyone who only knows how to do politics and is at the top because they were selected for during that time we'll just keep failing and whoever knows how to actually do real physics biology logistics capable stuff will get up regulated during this time okay so quarantine to stop the spread now i would like to see that called for it a nationwide level i'd also like to [3522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3522.19s)

see it called for at a statewide level because if it isn't called of the nation level states can do that right i would like to see it called for by mayor's at a city level i would like to see the celebrities come out and i'll tell everyone using their all the channels they have hey stay the  __  home because right now people pay more attention to celebrities than to epidemiologists even [3539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3539.2s)

in a life-or-death situation so the celebrity should confer their celebrity power to the epidemiologists and save lives they don't usually have the opportunity to save lives and help [[national security]] and all those things right now the way they did before and if they're left oriented save lives if they're right oriented [[national security]] again it doesn't matter it's the same thing on both sides at this particular point i'm not saying that both left and right wouldn't care about both things i just mean whatever it is someone cares about it's gonna be the same answer here so all of the approaches that can be taken to stop social transmission should be the first order and then in order for that to happen we have to do the economic [3588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3588.22s)

support and stimulus packages that the people will actually stay home and that can occur so that means stopping rents and mortgages insurance that small businesses won't go out of business and other businesses that are larger businesses but that are totally dependent upon human contact won't go out of business through tax credits through subsidies through whatever types [3614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3614.47s)

of simulus packages are needed the ubi or other kinds of food and medicine provisioning those types of actions have to be taken they don't all have to be taken at once because we're gonna have to figure them out and they're gonna have their own consequences president should come out and declare the key ones and say each day will be working on adding to this as makes sense and as we [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3634.39s)

see what the needs are but we will take care of this and so that people actually can stay home and that should be seen as a patriotic duty it should be called for as a patriotic duty also in addition to be able to make the quarantine happen not only do you need the economic support all the people who can't be on quarantine need to have the personal protective gear hazmat gear training [3662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3662.14s)

that they need and so that should be an absolute top priority and that's we mentioned many of the areas but you know you can factor what those areas are healthcare first responders infrastructure utilities etc vulnerable populations particularly need very hard quarantine measures so the seniors facilities the prisons the homeless facilities the immuno compromised places [3686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3686.74s)

those need very hard quarantines because we can't have spreading and yeah we can't we can't have spreading happening within those it'll be too much of a disaster so those should be particularly fiercely protected so next after quarantine and all that it takes to make that happen the focus is a full-court press with the private sector and the government [3717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3717.41s)

working together to ramp a high quality diagnostics so that we can do a bit witness diagnostics so we can move from a total quarantine to a smart quarantine so a lot of people will protest we don't have that many tests yet that's true or the turnaround time on the test is too slow or there's too many false negatives or the tests only show up after people have been sick it for a while yes all [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3740.24s)

that's true on the tests that we've had so when i'm saying we need to ramp up diagnostics adequate diagnostics what i mean is it's not a single strategy we've been collecting all of the diagnostic technology surplus new diagnostic tech in one place so that we can be seeing which ones have the capability to get what types of things where and have a multi-pronged strategy if there's anyone [3765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3765.74s)

who has real capability to help that financial or logistic please contact me can do that through facebook messenger but so we need to get the tests that currently exists even though they're inadequate to all the places that need them most so a triage to the places where the most spread can occur right there the following tracing of contacted individuals the counties that have the [3795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3795.14s)

most impact etc we need to ramp the production of tests that can be ramped in time even if their partial tests even though antibodies show up too late to be able to do prevention we need antibody tests because we want to be able to see his immunity conferred and if so who's immune because i'd be very helpful the kind of testing that i care most about at this point is testing [3822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3822.05s)

that can detect cases as early as possible after exposure with very high sensitivities a very low rate of false negatives very fast turnaround time and not having rate limiting reagents and this is the drive-through style testings health korea implemented there are a few companies that have technologies that are much better that can ramp in time and we're working on those those need [3850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3850.92s)

capital and support so that being said if people have that but the drive-thru type testing so let's just imagine a scenario where walmart in walgreens type parking lots get drive-through test capability so that somebody pulls in automatically video camera registers their license plate their driver's license gets taken they're tested if they are positive they go directly into [3878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3878.13s)

quarantine as a result they get early treatment and they don't have to go to icu and we're able to separate a quarantine people being quarantined at home means the whole family gets it in the most vulnerable people get it so being able to have quarantine facilities where then the rest of the family is treated as exposed and we get diagnostics to them but if they haven't [3898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3898.17s)

already all been infected they don't have to be is important and yeah people can get on early treatments and we can separate people who need to go to icu for normal non coronavirus reasons versus those with coronavirus and be able to separate facilities for that we're also going to see that as the doctors and nurses get sick but if they have access to early testing so they can [3922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3922.68s)

get on early treatment many of them either because their symptoms wouldn't have been that bad anyways because they're young and healthy or because of the early treatment we'll be able to keep working but they can't run the risk of infecting other people so you can have the negative pressure kove aid facilities and infected doctors and nurses on treatment working there [3941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3941.7s)

and uninfected doctors and nurses in the other place where people are coming in for heart attacks and strokes and other things like that so people drive in they go into an appropriate quarantine and response if they're positive if they're negative they get to park and go into walmart and go shopping and the pharmacies have the meds that people need the personal [3965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3965.94s)

protective gear and lysol and hand sanitizers provision through those kinds of places the food is available we can also see the conscription obviously of delivery services uber left or - whatever mean amazon capabilities in terms of delivering stuff to people to be able to help make the quarantine happen but so what i see is that we come off of total quarantine with a smart [3989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=3989.369s)

quarantine where those who are either not infected have never been infected or are infected but have no more viral shedding so we need tests that can determine total viral load also if up front we can determine total viral load we can determine how serious the case is likely to get and what kinds of treatments are warranted factoring the treatments have some side effect risk [4010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4010.609s)

but also afterwards we want to make sure that there's no more viral shedding so when does someone come off quarantine well it can't be an x number of days because there's going to be a long tailed distribution of how long people are still contagious we it actually has to be based on adequate testing and so then people who were either not infected or are no longer infected can go back to [4034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4034.94s)

work and you know off of quarantine still with personal protective gear social distancing wiping down doorknobs all those types of things because they have to assume that some people who are infected are still out until the total case number drops to very very low which is exactly what china is doing and south korea is doing once the total case number is very low then life can return [4056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4056.45s)

to normal but this can happen in like eight to ten weeks where we go from total quarantine to smart quarantine without a complete overwhelm and the icu is going to be overwhelmed no matter what but without a complete break of the medical system and without a complete break of the us or global economy now if you start thinking about trillions of loss and market value in the amount of [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4081.47s)

subsidy per month being in the closer to trillions type range of meaningful percentage of a trillion then whatever number of billions are needed to ramp the diagnostics obviously make sense right to be able to go from a total quarantine where most people aren't infected to a smart quarantine where everyone infected is quarantined and the other people aren't [4101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4101.849s)

obviously during that time we're also going to be ramping the isee use capabilities and we're going to be ramping treatment so treatments from antivirals to vaccines to ace to modulators to cytokine modulator czar all being developed super rapidly and again if we have a situation where people can get early diagnostics and then get treated and basically be fine [4129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4129.869s)

and have very little symptoms and not good icu not be intubated that's a very different world in a month or in two months even in weeks we'll have much better knowledge on treatment than we have today we'll have more a bit quittez availability of the treatment and the logistics capability to triage and get it where it's needed the diagnostics will be ramping so quarantine and all [4149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4149.339s)

the things it takes to make that happen ramp the diagnostics to become completely ubiquitous high quality diagnostics to move into sorts mark quarantine and the ramp of treatments if vaccines get somewhere awesome i'm if the antibody transfers get somewhere awesome but i'm not counting on those because of mutations and the main issues but i am expecting the treatments to be [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4174.71s)

very effective and then that's all dealing with the medical stuff then it's also ramp all of the vulnerabilities and [[national security]] type threats during this time and then ramp the ability for international aid and paying attention to the geopolitical position that we don't become myopic those are the responses at a national level that i really most want to see and as far as at [4203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4203.699s)

a bottom-up level we're seeing incredible responses of community self-organizing and private sector getting engaged and organizing that getting the personal protective equipment and various things to various places but we're also seeing a lot of duplication of efforts and not great coordinating so if anyone who has the capability in the interest [4230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4230.74s)

to do something can look to see who's already doing it are there groups that have good ability and more traction and join them that would be really more helpful if you're wanting to see how to make your city do a good job of planning if whether you're a mayor or you're just a community leader there are some cities that have already done a really good job copy/paste and then also share best [4250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4250.27s)

practices if you're doing something for your city or your state figure out how to share it with the other cities and states or if for your church or the other church complexes so that we have the maximum amount of learning sharing the least amount of duplication so daniel you've been writing about and talking about systemic risk [[existential risk]] for an awfully long time we put out quite a few films on the channel around that so you've been warning about these topics for a long time how are you how are you feeling now that it does seem that we're now facing a real world example of the sort of things that you've been talking about warning about for a long time well i mean it's it's been obvious to anyone paying attention that this was eminent i mean bill gates [4299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4299.26s)

has been talking about our susceptibility for a pandemic for quite some time and as high-profile as he has didn't have us get prepared and kovan didn't cause australia to burn last month right australia burned for other reasons and we haven't seen a whole continent be decimated in a natural disaster like that in recent history and the [[climate change]] where we had very hot dry period and it already used up the groundwater and whatever in australia that led to that happening is the same thing that's gonna cause 50 celsius heat waves hitting india and bangladesh that destroyed crops and have vast numbers of people in fatal circumstances just associated with that and then does that lead to war over the scarce resources does that cleave long muslim hindu lines [4354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4354.22s)

does that turn into an india-pakistan more bolson roo end up the brazilian amazon ecuador is also under massive threat at the headwaters of the amazon the hydrological pump of the amazon is where a huge amount of the rainfall from north america comes from so it's not just a south american issue and the lack of drop in the rainfall for north america would be a catastrophic [4378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4378.76s)

collapse of north america so it should be seen as a [[national security]] threat for north america there are so many of these issues and so the i'm hoping that right now people are feeling it and recognizing that okay australia was actually a big deal and this pandemic is actually a big deal and there's actually a the [[climate change]] mediated events and it is a force amplifier for other things it's a big deal and these aren't the same issue it's not like there's one issue but they're all caused by the same underlying fragile civilization of structures so the here's the closing frame i'd like to share that's just a simple frame as i can there are a lot of people that have a status quo bias or a [4435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4435.85s)

positivity bias that doesn't want to look at negative things or things that everything will be fine or things that risks are always overblown or something like that and they say something to the effect of hey look we have thought the rapture was come in since the 16th century that the end was nigh hmm and y2k was a bunch of hype in 2012 was a bunch of hype and sars and ebola and [4460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4460.84s)

those things were a bunch of hype and yes there's problems in the world but they're less bad than they used to be and they just drive innovation and that's the curve i think that this perspective is complete dangerous nonsense and it is more of a bias response than it is actually a thoughtful response because here are the factors i would like people [4491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4491.07s)

to think about regarding the uniqueness of the time we're in now relative to all other times and yet our intuition is conditioned and even our reason is conditioned from past experience in past time so we have to factor that all of the previous civilizations and previous empires died at some point they failed and none of them were eternal civilizations we don't still have a [4517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4517.0s)

byzantine or a egyptian or mayan or aztec or roman or whatever empire they died for reasons associated with self-induced collapse oftentimes they actually cut down all the trees and easter island did themselves or led to infernal inviting that created descent and collapse but oftentimes even if they were overtaken by external enemies they were overtaken by enemies that were [4544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4544.48s)

smaller than once they had protected against previously because they had underwent institutional decay so so far nobody has figured out how to avoid institutional decay especially as they scale a long term so we only know how to make civilizations that collapse various timeframes democracies collapse on a 2 to 300 year timeframe the u.s. is coming up on 250 years right now and we're [4566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4566.98s)

pretty near a collapse type scenario for a number of reasons it's actually very interesting to think about the way that the u.s. emerged as the superpower coming out of world war two that it didn't enter world war two as in the way that the european countries got radically downregulated in their relative dominance in the world via world war two and how easily a situation [4592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4592.12s)

like this could do the same thing where china comes out of this the way the u.s. came out of world war two if you want a democracy or a republic to last longer than the amount of time they've ever lasted you have to reboot them because institutional decay does occur so reboots are needed which is a super important topic but we only know how to make civilizations that collapse but for [4615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4615.46s)

the first time ever we have a fully globalized civilization so collapse means something it's summer meant for we have caused environmental damage locally that desertified the topsoil we couldn't feed the people but we could never actually make the entire biosphere  __  up right we couldn't do [[species extinction]] at scale everywhere or mess the entire oceans up or things like that [4635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4635.44s)

we don't have a chinese civilization in a u.s. civilization because if either of them fully failed the other one would also fail because of completely dependent interconnected [[supply chain|supply chains]] and completely interdependent biosphere type dynamics so we are facing a collapse of a civilization or an empire but where the scale of it is unprecedented the next part that is [4660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4660.61s)

really critical to get is that we have used our power either directly militarily in ways that cause harm or indirectly through in ways that cause harm through social stratification pollution and renewable resource externalities of various kinds but we never had tech where even if we wanted to we could  __  up everything at a global scale until world war ii that was [4687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4687.22s)

the beginning of us having truly globally catastrophic technology and the romans couldn't  __  everything up if they want to do at a global scale with the technology they had so that's why the development of the bomb in world war two created the emergence of a [[world system]] that was completely focused on not using our new technology and in the long arc of human history world war two [4712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4712.18s)

was like a second ago and that was the beginning of us having truly globally catastrophic capability so if you're using any forecasting from before that it's nonsense in terms of what kind of harm we didn't do because we also couldn't do okay the only stuff that's relevant is what kind of harm could we do and we did right so then factor the new capability [4735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4735.91s)

so world war two the [[bretton woods]] world we made the united nations and we made the world bank and we made the entire set of [[bretton woods]] agreements and all the whole world structure to make sure that we didn't use our new technology and that the super ours didn't fight but to the history of the world major empires had always fought so we needed to do something that [4758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4758.87s)

we had never done and we were able to do that because of a few things we were able to create debt based finance to be able to grow the economy rapidly so there was so much abundance we didn't have to have scarcity based wars but of course that based finance is unsustainable you can't do it forever because you can't run an [[exponential curve]] on a finite planet where there's actually [[materials economy]] that's involved forever right and so but we could do it for some time also at the time of the bread and [[bretton woods]] solutions we weren't near [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] anywhere we didn't have [[climate change]] we didn't have [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans we didn't have biodiversity loss we didn't have peak phosphorus or amazon threat or any of those things [4803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4803.78s)

right and one catastrophic weapon that's very hard to make it's very hard to enrich uranium there's only a few places that even have uranium mines two superpowers that have it that can both spy on each other pretty perfectly [[mutually assured destruction]] is possible but today we have dozens of catastrophic weapons not one catastrophic weapon we have many dozens of actors that have [4828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4828.26s)

them including non-state actors and many of the technologies aren't hard to produce we have much more systemic fragility it's important to understand that when you make something very efficient you also make it fragile right if you're operating your icu very efficiently it can't handle spikes if you're operating your infrastructure efficiently i can't handle spikes if you [4847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4847.58s)

have a [[supply chain]] that's very efficient and you get collapse anywhere you can get cascading collapse if you have lots of interacting dynamics where a drought somewhere leads to people having to move to already for resource scarce areas that leads to war an escalating war on already existing political tensions where larger weapons happen those types of cascade and [4869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4869.93s)

amplifier scenarios are also unique to this time in terms of their their scale their connectedness and so we have an explosion of risk happening at this time and also in terms of [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] curves as we can see with coronavirus we're not good at having an intuition for [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] our intuition has never really interacted with [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] very much so we're not conditioned to even notice what they are we're used to things that have very have more normal growth curves than that so our intuition for time scales is quite bad so the underlying biosphere the underlying infrastructure the underlying social tensions are getting more fragile there's more interconnectivity for cascade failures and our overall impact [4926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4926.64s)

capability is increasing exponentially and as we can see our intelligent coordinated responses are shitty this is the underlying situation we could have completely prevented this virus fortunately the death percentage on this one is not that bad so if we don't get our  __  together this will be terrible but we can get our  __  together for this and deal with it and use it to [4953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4953.13s)

harden our capability to deal with [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] of all kinds and actually get much smarter about this issue because so as we're ramping our diagnostic capabilities and our response capabilities for this we also want to be for the next round of mutation that could occur and not just the next round of mutation for this chrome virus but also whatever else comes next we can see [4974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4974.55s)

avian flu 's happening in [[factory farm|factory farms]] around the world like you know so we want to be upregulated to pandemics but we also want to be upregulated to all of the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] this one we were not prepared for and now we're having to deal with it in real time but had it been a carrington event taking out the electrical grid it would be so much more catastrophic and [4997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=4997.38s)

so we can prepare for it but we can't deal with it once it's happens that's one of the key things there's a lot of issues that once they've happened the it's just really terrible but preparing for it is doable and so one of the lessons hopefully is there's a lot of  __  that you just have to be prepared for ahead of time as opposed to deal with once it's occurred this one [5019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5019.9s)

is hopefully something that up regulates our response there and has us pay attention to systemic fragility and explosion of [[catastrophic risk]] and the inadequacy and atrophy of our overall governance systems and that neither the government mechanisms nor the market mechanisms adequately dealt with this so we need much better [[collective intelligence]] systems to be able to deal with risks and the current ones we have so as we are up regulating a response to this both the immediate and the second third fourth order effects we want to also be create not making things worse like creating total monopolies by the way we wrongly engage the private sector or whatever and we want to make sure that we're setting up capacity to handle the next ones better [5070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5070.3s)

daniel thank you very much for making time likewise thank you david as the tech revolution continues to destroy old media the internet is fueling a new intellectual awakening television made people look stupider than they were it turns out that people are smarter with longer attention spans then we thought i'm a journalist and filmmaker for many years i made documentaries for the likes [5099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5099.309s)

of the bbc and channel 4 but i don't think the mainstream media can provide the level of analysis and insight we need for the extraordinary times we're going through where the old structures that made sense of the world break down it's like we're entering just entering into the underworld and it's a descent we're feeling everything starting to shake and the center cannot hold [5122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5122.26s)

and when our ways of thinking break down it's the rebels and the renegades who dare to think differently who are needed to reboot the system and so what's happening is that people are perceiving because it's becoming increasingly obvious that all of these artifacts of the way that we've gone about doing civilisation are breaking down and failing in a way that is no longer easy [5142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5142.96s)

to pretend isn't happening and so as a consequence this triggers a deep visceral sense and good thing right because that deep visceral sense is the return to the elimin or the return to the mystery the shift that we are on the precipice of is not like the shift from the dark ages to the enlightenment it's like more like a shift from single cell to multicellular [5165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5165.49s)

life these are the people and ideas rebel wisdom is searching out to try to make sense of the growing chaos the evolution screwed up it handed us the tools to recognize that we don't have to value the game that it is playing and that we can now repurpose the hardware to something that's actually worthwhile that's what i actually had to open is that if enough people can come to that [5188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5188.26s)

realization then then we wake up and not in some  __  evangelical megachurch kind of way of being born again but in in a truly initiatory way being going again of like i know my purpose i know my part and i'm willing to practice resurrection i'm willing to offer my life fully and freely in love in every moment and then we're invincible like then we can turn things on a dime it's [5213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX5n0DYXnUQ&t=5213.04s)
