the idea that technology is values neutral values agnostic and people can use it for constructive or destructive purposes but it doesn't predispose anything it's just it's just silly naive technology elicits patterns of human behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead end up behaving differently because of their utilization of it and then other people then they end up shaping the world or other people race to also get the power of the technology and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the effect on [[social system|social systems]] and the minds of people of the change in our tooling marvin harris's work called cultural [41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=41.2s)

materialism looked at this deeply obviously uh marshall mcluhan looked specifically at the way that information technologies changed the nature of our beliefs minds values [[social system|social systems]] i will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics we'll disagree on the subtle details but i'll do it kind of like illustratively [59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=59.76s)

you think about the emergence of the plow the oxtron plow in the beginning of agriculture that came with it where before that you had hunter gather and then you had horticulture kind of a digging stick but not the plow well that the world changed a lot with that right and a few of the changes that um at least [82](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=82.08s)

some theorists believe in is when the oxtron plow started to proliferate any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually cultivate grain because just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter grain was a storable caloric surplus they could make it through the famines they could grow their population so the ones that [100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=100.0s)

used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody used it that corresponding with the use of a plow animism went away everywhere that it existed because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to pull a plow so the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind we have to [118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=118.399s)

beat the cow all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal man has dominion over earth and the nature of even our religious and spiritual ideas change you went from women primarily using the digging stick to do the horticulture or gathering before that men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the plow because the upper body strength actually really mattered women would [136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=136.879s)

have miscarriages when they would do it when they were pregnant so all the caloric supply started to come from men where it had been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods following that um obviously we went from very s that particular line of thought then [154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=154.08s)

also says that feminism followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism um in the west has started to follow women being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential once the internal combustion engine was much stronger um and we can drive a tractor so i don't think to try to trace complex [176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=176.959s)

things to one cause is a good idea so i think this is a reductionist view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values agnostic is silly technology codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior and believing in them the plow also is the beginning of the anthropocene right it was the beginning [197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=197.519s)

of us changing the environment radically to to clear-cut areas to just make them useful for people which also meant the change of the view of where the the web of life were just a part of it etc so all those types of things um so that's brilliantly put but by the way that was just brilliant [214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=214.0s)

but the question is so it's not agnostic but so we have to look at what the psychological effects of specific tech applied certain ways are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing you intended it's doing like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal culture in the beginning of empire and the class [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=238.319s)

systems that came with that we can go on and on about what the plow did um the beginning of surplus was inheritance which then became the capital model and like lots of things so we have to say when we're looking at the tech how is what are the values built into the way the tech is being built that are not obvious right so you always have to consider externalities yes and the externalities are not just physical to the environment they're also to how the people are being conditioned and how the relationality between them question i'm asking you so i personally would rather be led by a plow and a tractor than stalin okay that's the question i'm asking you is uh in creating an emergent government or people where there's a democracy that's dynamic that makes choices that does governance at at like a very kind of liquid like uh there's a bunch of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales [298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=298.24s)

right and doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate and impose rule okay that's the stalin version i'm saying isn't there the uh alter the isn't the alternative that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and the tractor which is the [321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=321.84s)

modern version of that is like the internet the the digital space where we can the monetary system where you have the cryptocurrency and so on but you have much more importantly to me at least is just basic social interaction the mechanisms of human transacting with each other in the space of ideas isn't [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=341.68s)

so yes it's not agnostic definitely not agnostic you've had a brilliant rant there the tractor has effects but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system of uh governance yes but i wouldn't say we're on track you haven't seen anything promising sometimes i haven't seen anything [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=364.319s)

promising is that to be on track requires understanding and guiding some of the things differently than is currently happening and it's possible that's actually what i really care about so you couldn't have had a stalin without having certain technologies emerge he couldn't have ruled such a big area without [382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=382.24s)

transportation technologies without the train without the communication tech that made it possible so when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than a stall and there's a relationship between them that is more recursive which is new [[physical tech|physical technologies]] allow rulers to rule with more power over larger distances [405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=405.36s)

historically and um but some things are more responsible for that than others like stalin also ate stuff for breakfast but the thing he ate for breakfast is less responsible for the starvation of millions than than the train the train is more responsible for that and then the weapons of war are more [425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=425.44s)

responsible so some technology like let's not throw it all in the you're saying like technology has a responsibility here but some is better than others i'm saying that people's use of technology will change their behavior so it has behavioral dispositions built in the change of the behavior will also [444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=444.16s)

change the values in the society it's very complicated right it will also as a result both make people who have different kinds of predispositions with regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities and so we have to think about these things it's kind of well [462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=462.08s)

understood that the [[printing press]] and then in early industrialism ended feudalism and created kind of [[nation state|nation states]] so one thing i would say as a long trend that we can look at is that whenever there is a step function a major leap in technology [[physical tech|physical technology]] the the underlying techno-industrial [481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=481.759s)

base with which we do stuff it ends up coding for it ends up predisposing a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous [[social system]] what had not emerged to try to solve and so it usually ends up breaking the previous [[social system|social systems]] the way the plow broke the tribal system the way that the [[industrial revolution]] broke the feudal system and then new [[social system|social systems]] have to emerge they can deal with that the new powers the new dispositions whatever with that tech obviously the nuke broke nation-state governance being adequate and said we can't ever have that again so then it created this in international governance apparatus world [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=518.719s)

so i guess what i'm saying is that the solution is not [[exponential tech]] following the current path of what the market incentivizes [[exponential tech]] to do market being a previous [[social tech]] i would say that [[exponential tech]] if we look at different types of [[social tech]] so let's just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the [[emergent order]] thing right at least that's the story and which is and this is why if you look this important um part to build first it's kind of doing it it's just doing it poorly you're saying i mean that's it is [[emergent order]] in some sense i mean that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government correct i mean i i said at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves early on it doesn't do it for all classes equally et cetera but the the idea of democracy is that is [[participatory governance]] and so you notice that the modern democracies [596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=596.32s)

emerged out of the european enlightenment and specifically because the idea that a lot of people some huge number not a tribal number huge number of anonymous people who don't know each other are not bonded to each other who believe different things who grew up in different ways can all work together to [612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=612.64s)

make collective decisions well that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises and the thing that matters to them for what matters to other strangers that's actually wild like it's a wild idea that that would even be possible and it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we could all do the philosophy of [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=629.839s)

science and we could all do the hegelian dialectic those ideas had emerged right and it was that we we could all so our choice making because we've said a society is trying to coordinate choice making the [[emergent order]] is the order of our of the choices that we're making not just the level of the individuals [651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=651.04s)

but what groups of individuals corporations nations states whatever do our choices are based on our choice making is based on our [[sensemaking]] and our [[meaning making]] our [[sensemaking]] is what do we believe is happening in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be our [[meaning making]] is what do we care about right our values generation what do we care about that we're trying to move the world in the direction of if you ultimately are trying to move the world in a direction that is really really different than the direction i'm trying to we have very different values we're gonna have a hard time and if you think the world is a very different [681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=681.839s)

world right if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere one of the worst problems and i think it's not even a thing if you think [[climate change]] is almost existential and i think it's not even a thing we're gonna have a really hard time coordinating and so we have to be able to have shared [[sensemaking]] of can we come to understand just what is happening together and then can we do shared values generation okay maybe i'm emphasizing a particular value more than you but i can see how i can take your perspective and i can see how the thing that you value is worth valuing and i can see how it's affected by this [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=715.519s)

thing so can we take all the values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition i created just to benefit these ones it harms the ones that you care about which is why you're opposing my proposition yeah we don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently to see and this is a reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the votes almost all the time it almost never gets 90 of the votes is because it benefits some things and harms other things we can say oh theory of trade-offs but we didn't even try to say could we see what everybody cares about and see if there is a better solution [749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=749.12s)

so how do we fix that try i i wonder is it is it as simple as the [[social tech|social technology]] of education well no it's that the proposition crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or [[participatory governance]] and it's not currently but it's this isn't that the humans creating that situation [769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=769.68s)

so so one way there's two ways to fix this one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life and the second is to create somehow systems that yeah both so i understand the education part but creating systems that's why that's why i mentioned the technologies is creating social networks essentially [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=789.36s)

yes that's actually necessary okay so let's go to the first part and then we'll come to the second part so democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we could all do a dialectic and come to understand what other people valued and so that we could actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just [811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=811.2s)

 __  you we're gonna get our thing in war right and that we could sense make together we could all apply the philosophy of science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element to the objectivity in that way [825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=825.12s)

and so this is why um i believe jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a broken government or i'm paraphrasing or a broken government perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make build a new government if they don't understand what's going on [841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=841.199s)

they can't possibly make good choices and washington i'm paraphrasing again first president said the number one aim of the federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government science of government was the term of art think about what that means right science of government would be [[game theory]] coordination theory history wouldn't call [[game theory]] yet history sociology economics right all the things that lead to how we understand human coordination i think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule of law and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies because if the number one aim was to protect the border [883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=883.36s)

from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship quite effectively and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship as a police state and so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all the citizens in the science of government it won't stay a [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=901.04s)

democracy long you can see so both education and the [[fourth estate]] the [[fourth estate]] being the so education can i make sense of the world am i trained to make sense of the world the [[fourth estate]] is what's actually going on currently the news do i have good unbiased information about it those are both considered prerequisite [916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=916.56s)

institutions for democracy to even be a possibility and then at the scale it was initially suggested here the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a proposition and the first thing i ever saw was the proposition to know anything about and i got to vote yes or no [933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=933.839s)

it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could get crafted in real time through the conversation which is why there is that founding father statement that that voting is the death of democracy voting fundamentally is polarizing the population in some kind of sublimated war but and we'll do that as the last step but what we want to do first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition how could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better where this proposition still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to antennas to that better can we work on [964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=964.0s)

this together in the in a town hall we could have that as the scale increased we lost the ability to do that now as you mentioned the internet could change that the fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do um that we stopped having this kind of [979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=979.36s)

developmental um propositional development process when the town hall ended the fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane and aligned with class interests i would push back to say that the internet has those things it just says a lot of other things i feel like the internet has places where that encourage synthesis of competing ideas and [[sensemaking]] which is what we're talking about it's just that it's also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing it under current incentives perhaps has to do with capitalism and [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1021.759s)

the market is there linux is awesome right and wikipedia and places where you have and they have problems but places where you have [[open source]] sharing of information betting of information towards collective building is that building something like like how much has that affected our court systems or our policing systems or our military systems or first of all i think a lot but not not enough i i i think that's something i told you offline yesterday's uh perhaps that's a whole nother discussion but i i don't think we're quite quantifying the impact on the world of the positive impact of wikipedia [1060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1060.0s)

you said the policing the i mean i just i just think the amount of um empathy that could like knowledge i think can't help but lead to empathy just knowing okay just knowing okay i'll give you some pieces of information knowing how many people died in various awards that already that delta when you have millions of people have [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1087.919s)

that knowledge it's like it's a little like slap in the face like oh like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people were tortured you know like just a little bit and when a lot of people know that because of wikipedia or the effect there's second order [1107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1107.28s)

effect of wikipedia which is it's not that necessarily people read wikipedia it's like youtubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly read a wikipedia article and create a compelling video describing that wikipedia article that then millions of people watch and they understand that [1128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1128.48s)

holy  __  a lot of there was such first of all there was such a thing as world war ii in world war one okay like they can at least like learn about it they can learn about this was like recent they can learn about slavery they can learn about all kinds of injustices in the world and that i think has [1145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1145.52s)

a lot of effects to our to the way whether you're a police officer a a lawyer a judge in the jury or just a regular civilian citizen the way you approach the every other communication you engage in even if the system of that communication is very much flawed so i think there's a huge positive effect on wikipedia [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1169.28s)

that's my case for wikipedia so you should donate to wikipedia i mean i'm a huge fan but there's very few systems like it which is sad to me so i think it's it would be a useful exercise for any uh listener of the show to really try to run the dialectical synthesis process [1190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1190.799s)

with regard to a topic like this and take the techno concern perspective with regard to information tech that folks like tristan harris take and say what are all of the things that are getting worse and what and are any of them following an [[exponential curve]] and how much worse how quickly could that be and then and do that fully without mitigating it then take the techno-optimist perspective and see what things are getting better in a way that kurzweil or diamondus or someone might do and try to take that perspective fully and say are some of those things [1232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1232.799s)

exponential what could that portend and then try to hold all that at the same time and i think there are ways in which depending upon the metrics we're looking at things are getting worse on [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] and better on [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] for different metrics at the same time which which i hold is the [1251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1251.679s)

destabilization of previous system and either an emergence to a better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible and so i want my optimism not to be about my assessment i want my assessment to be just as  __  clear as it can be i want my optimism to be what inspires [1270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1270.64s)

the solution process on that clear assessment so i never i never want to apply optimism in the [[sensemaking]] right i want to just try to be clear if anything i want to make sure that the challenges are really well understood but that's in service of an optimism [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1287.84s)

that there are good potentials even if i don't know what they are that are worth seeking right there's kind of a there is a some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard problems but then i want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see is that solution not going to [1306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1306.48s)

work does it have second order effects and then not get not get upset by that because i then come back to how to make it better so just a relationship between optimism and pessimism in the dialectic of how they how they can work so when i of course we can say that wikipedia is a pretty awesome example [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1324.72s)

of a thing we can look at the places where it has limits or has failed where on a celebrity topic or a corporate interest topic you can pay wikipedia editors to edit more frequently and various things like that but you can also see where there's a lot of information that was kind of decentrally created [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1344.4s)

that is good information that is more easily accessible to people than everybody buying their own encyclopedia britannica or walking down to the library and they can be updated in real time faster and i think you're very right that the business model is a big difference because [1361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1361.2s)

wikipedia is not a for-profit corporation it is a it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other than tending to the information commons and i think the two masters issue is a tricky one when i'm trying to optimize for very different kinds of things where i have to sacrifice one for the [1384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1384.559s)

other and i can't find synergistic satisfiers which one and if i have a [[fiduciary responsibility]] to shareholder uh profit maximization and you know what what does that end up creating i think the ad model that silicon valley took um i think jaron lanier i don't know if you've had him on the show but he has an [1405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1405.44s)

interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model um silicon valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but uh also the belief that information should be free and also the [[network dynamics]] with the more people you got on you got increased value per user per capita as [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1424.48s)

more people got on so you didn't want to do anything to slow the rate of adoption some places actually you know paypal paying people money to join the network because the uh value of the network would be there'd be a metcalf-like dynamic proportional to the square of the total number of users so um the ad model made sense of how do [1441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1441.919s)

we make it free but also be a business get everybody on but not really thinking about what it would mean to and this is now the whole idea that if you aren't paying for the product you are the product um if if they have a [[fiduciary responsibility]] to their shareholder maximize profit their customer is the advertiser the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral mod for them for advertisers that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech could have been if applied with a different business model or a different purpose um i think there's because facebook and google and other information and communication platforms end up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are in a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information then even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer [1503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1503.039s)

or a priest might have in a different setting they basically are accessing privileged information there should be a [[fiduciary responsibility]] and in normal fiduciary law if there's this principal agent thing if you are a uh principal and i'm an agent on your behalf i don't have a [[game theory|game theoretic]] relationship with you right if you're sharing something with me and i'm the priest or i'm the therapist i'm never going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is but facebook is gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to modify people's behavior for a behavior that [1538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1538.799s)

they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior but what the corporation did so i think this is an example of the [[physical tech]] evolving in the context of the previous [[social tech]] where it's being shaped in particular ways and here unlike wikipedia that evolved for the the information commons this evolved for [1556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1556.799s)

fulfilling particular agenda purpose most people when they're on facebook think it's just a tool that they're using they don't realize it's an agent right it is a corporation with a profit motive and and as i'm interacting with it it has a goal for me different than my goal for myself and i might want to be on for a short [1575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1575.12s)

period of time its goal is maximize time on site and so there is a rivalry that is take but where there should be a fiduciary contract i think that's actually a huge deal and i think if we said could we apply facebook like technology to uh develop people's [1597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1597.2s)

citizenry capacity right to develop their personal health and well-being and habits as well as their um cognitive understanding the complexity with which they can process the health of their relationships that would be amazing to start to explore and this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is a major [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1620.64s)

step function in the [[physical tech]] it obsoletes the previous [[social tech]] and the new [[social tech]] has to emerge what i would say is that when we look at the nation-state level of the world today the more top-down authoritarian nation-states are as the exponential text started to emerge the digital technology started to [1642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1642.08s)

emerge they were in a position for better long-term planning and better coordination and so the authoritarian state started applying the [[exponential tech]] intentionally to make more effective authoritarian states and that's everything from like an internet of things surveillance system [1658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1658.48s)

going into machine learning systems to the sesame credit system to all those types of things and so they're upgrading their [[social tech]] using the [[exponential tech]] otherwise within a [[nation state]] like the us but democratic [[open society|open societies]] this is the countries the states are not directing the technology in a way that [1680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1680.08s)

makes a better [[open society]] meaning better [[emergent order]] they're saying well the corporations are doing that and the state is doing the relatively little thing it would do aligned with the previous corporate law that no longer is relevant because there wasn't [[fiduciary responsibility]] for things like that there wasn't antitrust because this creates functional [1697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1697.52s)

monopolies because of [[network dynamics]] right where youtube has more users than vimeo and every other video player together amazon has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together you get one big dog per vertical because of network effect which is a kind of organic monopoly that the previous anti-trust [1715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1715.52s)

law didn't even have a place that wasn't a thing anti-monopoly was only something that emerged in the space of government contracts so um so what we see is the new [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] is being directed by authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] to make better authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] and by corporations to make more powerful corporations the more powerful corporations when we think about the scottish enlightenment when the idea of markets was being advanced the modern kind of ideas of markets the biggest corporation was tiny compared to what the biggest corporation today is so the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny and the asymmetry now in terms of the [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1754.08s)

total technology it employs total amount of money total amount of information processing is so many orders of magnitude and rather than there be demand for an authentic thing that creates a basis for supply as supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the demand wasn't coordinated because you don't [1774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1774.399s)

have a labor union of all the customers working together but you do have a coordination on the supply side supply started to recognize that it could manufacture demand it could make people want  __  that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't increase their happiness in a meaningful way might increase addiction addiction is a very good way [1788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1788.96s)

to manufacture demand and so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and you have to have it for status or whatever it is the intelligence of the market was breaking now it's no longer a [[collective intelligence]] system that is up regulating [1806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1806.559s)

real desire for things that are really meaningful you're able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather than the higher ones the addictive patterns drive those and have people watch it that doesn't actually make them happy or make the world better and so we really also have to we have to update our theory of markets because [1822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1822.88s)

behavioral econ showed that homo economicus the rational actor is not really a thing but particularly at greater and greater scale can't really be a thing voluntarism isn't a thing or if my corp if my company doesn't want to advertise on facebook i just will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the  __  attention is [1839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1839.919s)

and so then i can say it's voluntary but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly same if i'm gonna sell on amazon or things like that so what i would say is these corporations are becoming more powerful than [[nation state|nation states]] in some ways and they are also debasing the integrity of the [[nation state|nation states]] the [[open society|open societies]] so the democracies are getting weaker as a result of [[exponential tech]] and the kind of new tech companies that are kind of a new feudalism tech feudalism because it's not a democracy inside of a tech company or the supply and demand relationship when you have manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type functions and so we have basically a new feudalism controlling [[exponential tech]] and authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] controlling it and those attractors are both shitty and so i'm interested in the application of [[exponential tech]] to making better [[social tech]] that makes [[emergent order]] possible and within that [[emergent order]] can bind and direct the [[exponential tech]] in fundamentally healthy not x-risk oriented directions i think the relationship of [[social tech]] and [[physical tech]] can make it i think we can actually use the [[physical tech]] to make better [[social tech]] but it's not given that we do if we don't make better [1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1921.679s)

[[social tech]] then i think the [[physical tech]] empowers really shitty [[social tech]] that it's not a world that we want i don't know if it's a road we want to go down but i tend to believe that the market will create exactly the thing you're talking about which i feel like there's a lot of money to be made [1938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1938.559s)

in creating a [[social tech]] that creates a better citizen it creates a better human being the this this uh the the your description of facebook and so on which is a system that creates addiction which manufacturers demand is not obviously inherently the consequence of the markets like i [1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1967.919s)

feel like that's the the first stage of us like baby deer trying to figure out how to use the internet i i feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates compersion and love honestly i mean i i really from we can have this i can make the business case for it i don't know [1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=1989.84s)

i don't think we want to really have that discussion but don't do you have some hope that that's the case and what i guess if not then how do we fix the system of markets that work so well for the united states for so long like i said every [[social tech]] worked for a while like tribalism worked well for two or three hundred thousand [2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2008.24s)

years i think [[social tech]] has to keep evolving the [[social tech|social technologies]] with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to keep evolving as our [[physical tech]] does so i think the thing that we call markets of course we can try to say oh even biology runs on markets and [2027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2027.76s)

but the thing that we call markets the underlying theory homo economicus demand driving supply that thing broke it broke with scale in particular um and a few other things so it needs updated in a really fundamental way um i think there's something even deeper [2047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2047.2s)

than making money happening that it in some ways will obsolete money making i think capitalism is not about business so if you think about business i'm gonna produce a good or a service that people want and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service that's the world of business [2070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2070.56s)

but that's not capitalism capitalism is the management and allocation of capital which financial services was a tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of the total market it's a different creature so if i was in business and i was producing a good or service and i was [2088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2088.079s)

saving up enough money that i started to be able to invest that money and gain interest or do things like that i could start realizing i'm making more money on my money than i'm making on producing the goods and services so i stop even paying attention to goods and services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do i utilize capital to create more capital and capital gives me more optionality because i can buy anything with it than a particular good or service that only some people want capitalism more capital ended up meaning more control i could put more people under my [2124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2124.8s)

employment i could buy larger pieces of land novel access to resource mines and put more technology under my employment so it meant increased agency and also increased control i think attentionalism is even more powerful so rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in [2148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2148.64s)

the least work they can there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable than slavery right have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever music this is a cynical take but a meaningful [2165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2165.92s)

take um so people so capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior right and yet where people still feel free in some meaningful way they they're not feeling like they're going to be punished by the state if they don't do something it's like punished by the market via [2188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2188.88s)

homelessness or something but the market is this invisible thing i can't put an agent on so it feels like free and so if if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free capital ends up being a way to do that but i think affecting their attention is even deeper [2209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2209.2s)

because if i can affect their attention i can both affect what they want and what they believe and what they feel and we statistically know this very clearly facebook has done studies that based on changing the feed it can change beliefs emotional dispositions etc and so i think there's a way that the [2226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2226.48s)

the harvest and directing of attention is even a more powerful system than capitalism it is effective in capitalism to generate capital but i think it also generates influence beyond what capital can do and so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type of tech to direct other [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2250.24s)

people's attention if so um towards what towards what metrics of what a good civilization and good human life would be what's the oversight process what is the transparency i can i can answer all the things you're mentioning uh i i can build i guarantee you if i i'm not such a lazy ass uh i'll be part [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2272.64s)

of the many people doing this as transparency and control i'll get to giving control to individual people okay so maybe the corporation has coordination on its goals that all of its customers or users together don't have so there's some asymmetry where it's uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i [2296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2296.079s)

could actually help all of the customers to coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating them adequately about the effects the externalities on them this is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the atmosphere it's their their minds their beings their families their relationships um such that they will in group change their behavior and um i think the idea one way of saying what you're saying i think is that you think that you can rescue homo economicus from uh the rational actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose the best one at the best price the kind [2338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2338.56s)

of rand von mises hayek that you can rescue that from dan ariely and behavioral econ that says that's actually not how people make choices they make it based on status hacking largely whether it's good for them or not in the long term and the large asymmetric corporation can run propaganda in [[narrative warfare]] that hits people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and their lots of other things in ways that they can't even perceive that are happening they're not paying attention to that the site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever else so you're saying i think we can recover [2371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2371.92s)

homo economics and not just through a singles like mechanism technology there's there's the uh not to keep mentioning the guy but platforms like joe rogan and so on that that make help make viral the ways that the education of negative externalities can become viral in this world so interestingly [2395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2395.359s)

i actually agree with you that got them that four and a half hours in that we can tech can do some good all right well see what you're talking about is the application of tech here broadcast tech where you can speak to a lot of people and that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken too differently which [2418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2418.0s)

means it has to be different voices to get amplified to those audiences more like facebook's tech but nonetheless we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then the word of mouth is a powerful thing you need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like lands or catapulted whatever i don't know what the right weapon is [2434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2434.88s)

but then it just spreads to word of mouth through all kinds of tech including facebook so let's come back to the fundamental thing the fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting parts of our self actually having more harmony than they might have to uh family extended family local [2455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2455.2s)

all the way up to global we want [[emergent order]] where our choices have more alignment right we want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than we want fundamentally different things or make totally different sense of the world where warfare of some kind becomes the only solution emerging order requires us [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2478.839s)

in our choice making requires us being able to have related [[sensemaking]] and related [[meaning making]] processes can we apply digital technologies and [[exponential tech]] in general to try to increase the capacity to do that where the technology called a town hall the [[social tech]] that we all get together and talk obviously is very [2501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2501.28s)

scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than networks of aligned interest can we build new better versions of those types of things and going back to the idea that a democracy or [[participatory governance]] depends upon comprehensive education in the science of government which includes being able to understand [2520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2520.96s)

things like asymmetric information warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize adequately can you utilize some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive education of the people and maybe comprehensive informedness so both fixing the decay in both [2538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2538.56s)

education and the [[fourth estate]] that have happened so the people can start self-organizing to then influence the corporations the nation-states to do different things and or build new ones themselves yeah fundamentally that's the thing that has to happen we the [[exponential tech]] gives us a novel problem landscape that the world never had the nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required this whole [[bretton woods]] world the [[exponential tech]] gives us novel problem landscape our existing problem-solving processes aren't doing a good job we have had more countries get nukes we [2571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2571.839s)

haven't nuclear deep proliferation we haven't achieved any of the un's sustainable development goals we haven't kept any of the new categories of tech from making [[arms race|arms races]] so our global coordination is not adequate to the problem landscape so we need fundamentally better problem solving processes a market or a state is a problem-solving process we need better [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2591.599s)

ones it can do the speed and scale of the current issues right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we regulated ddt out of existence or cigarettes not for people under 18 they'd already killed so many people and we let the market do the thing but as elon has made the point that won't work for ai by the time we recognize afterwards that we have an autopoetic ai that's a problem you won't be able to reverse it that there's a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either self-replicating and disintermediates humans to keep going doesn't need humans to keep going [2624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2624.64s)

or you have tech that just has um exponentially fast effects your regulation has to come early it can't come after the effects have happened the negative effects have happened if because the negative x could be too big too quickly so we basically need new problem solving processes that do [2642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2642.48s)

better at being able to internalize externality solve the problems on the right time scale and the right geographic scale and those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting them and being able to participate in their development which is what i would call kind of a new [[cultural enlightenment]] a renaissance that has to happen where people start understanding the new power that [[exponential tech]] offers the way that it is actually damaging current governance structures that we care about and creating an x-risk landscape but could also be redirected towards more protopic purposes and then [2682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2682.56s)

saying how do we rebuild new social institutions what are adequate social institutions where we can do [[participatory governance]] at scale and time and how can the people actually participate to build those things i the the solution that i see working requires a process like that and the result maximizes love so [2704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtbMps1PDFc&t=2704.8s)

again elon must be right that love is the answer you
