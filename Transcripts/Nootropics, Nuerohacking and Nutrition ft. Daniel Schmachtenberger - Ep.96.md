hey this is mike as you and you're listening to the brute strength podcast this week's guest is daniel schmuck dan burger co-founder and director of research and development at neuro hacker collective a company that specializes in developing things to improve cognitive function they're their only product out now is a nootropic called qualia which is basically to supercharge your brain and so when i went into this [26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=26.939s)

conversation i had intended to talk all about nootropics and ways to you know what are some some legal medicines that people can take to improve their their brain function but what we actually ended up talking about was first off how - what would are basically the prerequisites for someone to be meeting before using these types of supplements so we talked about adrenal fatigue and [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=55.559s)

how to know if you're drinking too much caffeine we talked about sleep a little bit about nutrition because the basic premise is that if you don't have some of these basic or all of these basics down pat then it's like putting a turbocharger and i'm using his wording here a turbocharger in a car without an engine so putting a turbocharger in a car without an engine what means that [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=84.18s)

the car will go nowhere but if you have an engine without a turbocharger then your car will still move so we talked about the engine portion of the equation on this one and then we're going to do a follow-up soon daniel is an incredibly intelligent guy and i learned a ton from this one and i know you will too enjoy the show what's up everyone this is mike cashew i'm here with daniel 'shmock [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=107.97s)

timber ger co-founder and director of rd at neuro hacker collectives daniel i know you're an incredibly busy guy thank you so much for making some time to do this with me man i'm very excited happy to be here with you this is fun awesome so we you know before before the show started just now we were talking about my personal experience with cats and the fact that i've been taking way [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=133.379s)

too much caffeine and i got off completely for a couple weeks ago and as we got into conversation about it it sounds like i may need to take quite a bit more time off and so i thought it might be an interesting place to start because a lot of my listeners i know are caffeine addicts right there's there's even a company in the crossfit space called and [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=156.12s)

weightlifting space called caffeine and kilos and it's very you know romanticized and people just love their coffee and so i think this this would be a really useful conversation for us to kind of start out with for people to know if you know they if they might need to do the same thing that i'm about to do so what is what are the signs that someone is taking too much caffeine [181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=181.76s)

mm-hmm so step back a little bit and recognize that the caffeine is a psychoactive chemical compound right we can say it's a psychoactive drug and it's one of humanity's favorite ones up there with alcohol and cannabis etc for a very long time from tea and coffee and you know many sources and i think it's a beautiful molecule and can actually have life extension and life enhancing [217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=217.699s)

properties used rightly and like any tool and especially the more powerful tool can also have life damaging properties used improperly and it's pretty easy to misuse caffeine the easiest way to misuse caffeine is to use it to deal with tiredness from not resting enough so if someone is not sleeping enough or they're not sleeping well and the way they notice that is [246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=246.51s)

that they're either tired in the morning when they wake up say to in long they don't feel fully rested or they get tired in the afternoon their answer to it rather than to rest is to stimulate that's how adrenal fatigue and burnout happens and so we kind of paradoxically caffeine is best used when people are already energized and they are then using it for [272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=272.93s)

enhancement of metabolic activity in an already healthy system that can handle the stimulus as opposed to in a under rested under you know operating system that can't really handle the stimulus without damage so that's the biggest thing and there are so many people who use caffeine as a like as if it is a replacement for adequate or good sleep or good rest in other ways and that's [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=302.62s)

that is a very fast way to make it very bad for you right so what you're kind of suggesting it sounds like is that one of the biggest benefits of caffeine is more to do with the metabolism rather than to do with boosting your energy and stimulating you in that sort of way is that is that what i'm hearing when even regarding the kind of stimulant [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=327.79s)

properties the central [[nervous system]] stimulant properties the way it inhibits adenosine the way that it has a dopaminergic effect those still work much better on a well-rested system that can handle being stimulated without being damaged right because if a system is getting tired it means the body is endogenously down regulating rather than up regulating because it wants to be an [349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=349.85s)

arrest and repair point place rather than in a you know fully on and utilized place so when the body needs to be an arrest and repair place and we stimulate it to be in a non place that is at the cost of the integrity of the system gotcha so that's the first big thing with regard to caffeine is it's really critical that caffeine is not being used because it's needed it's being used when [376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=376.16s)

it's not needed as an enhancement to the system gods raden that's not just caffeine that's if someone's using nicotine so using theobromine if they're using any kind of stimulant it's important to eat that in mind so before we go into how to identify if someone is you know taking too much of caffeine or any stimulant why is it even important like [402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=402.12s)

you know what what are the the dangers to someone's performance and even health yeah so many things if if you look at a dynasty inhibition if and to adenosine is a neuro chemical that helps bring on the sleep impulse and so caffeine inhibits that molecule if you're trying to inhibit it when it's coming on strong because it needs to come on then you'll end up getting imbalances in your [431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=431.37s)

adenosine cycle and in your circadian cycles which will look like not getting as good a quality sleep in not getting it's not repaired during your sleep it can then look like resistance to adenosine inhibition and so you'll notice that by having less of an effect from coffee where you can take coffee or any source of caffeine and still fall asleep afterwards that means that your [453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=453.39s)

ability to inhibit the adenosine cycle is you know it's bitten down regulated and then specifically adrenal fatigue and adrenal burnout happens largely when you continue to stress a system that has been stressed and now needs to repair before we give it adequate repair and when you understand all of the roles of the renal glands have in converting neurologic impulse to endocrine impulse [482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=482.13s)

you know it's involved in fat metabolism and muscle repair and lean body muscle mass it's involved in everything from genetic transcription to the regulation of the rest of the endocrine system to immune function to bone density and so over stimulating and over taxing your adrenal system is definitely not something somebody wants to do got it so how how what are some signs were some [510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=510.57s)

other signs that people can look for where some tests they can give themselves yeah one of the common ones is that the stimulating effect that caffeine had early in someone's use it doesn't have anymore and that's the sign of desensitization down regulation so they used to eight ounces of coffee and feel increased wakefulness now they have to [536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=536.85s)

drink more coffee to still notice a smaller effect if you used to not be able to fall asleep on coffee and now you can fall asleep on it if you need more than you used to need if you are having a sense of needing it or needing it more times in the course of a day later into the day if you're noticing the effects less these are all signs of desensitization down-regulation so one [562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=562.509s)

of the key things with pretty much anything is in terms of anything that we're taking in other than like water and air is cycling and so just like with workouts you need to have cycles between stressing the muscles and then letting them rest and repair and you want to kind of cycle between different workouts because if you keep doing the same workout you start to desensitize to that [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=587.709s)

particular stimulus and you will get less from it than if you cycle it - another way of stressing muscle and if you think of it from a evolutionary point of view in terms of chemistry coming into the body pretty much other than water there was no food source that was always available all year round and so our body was consistently getting different kinds of [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=609.04s)

chemical input and then regulating in a hunter-gatherer kind of environment so rotating our foods and rotating our supplements and etc is valuable and different ones need to rotate on different cycles there are some things that down regulate quickly like say some this isn't a supplement but you know from a from a kind of neuro hacking point of view if someone does mdma they [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=634.569s)

don't have to do that many times before their system will start to acclimate to it down regulate and then have pretty bad symptomology if they stop doing in so someone really shouldn't do that more than and it's going to depend on their individual physiology some people might be able do it a couple times a month some people only once every several months so the cycle there has to be [659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=659.17s)

relatively little on lots of off whereas say someone is taking resistant starch as a prebiotic they can take that most of the time but pretty much anything should be cycled off now and again with regard to caffeine it's it's actually a molecule that people habituate to and then get a low level of addiction or dependence quite quickly which is the the signal of [684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=684.279s)

that is getting headaches when you come off of it and so letting people stay in an on cycle longer so that they're not dealing would say you know headaches every week is a cycling off you know on the weekend the general recommendation i get to most people is if they want to use caffeine regularly as opposed to just now and again which i think is fine to do if you're sleeping enough and not [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=709.3s)

overusing it is give or take one week every quarter you come off of it and the first couple days suck you can take a few pro fun for headache if you need to sleeping those first few days extra is valuable because even if we're good about sleep almost all of us end up accumulating a little bits of sleep that down again and sleep banking actually does work to some degree so at least a [733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=733.72s)

week per quarter off now if someone has not been that for a long time so they've been on their caffeine source regularly for years and especially if they have under slept in association with that and especially if they have taken more than caffeine than they should be to begin with and they've pin it down regulate their sensitivity they might need to come off for much longer than a week [757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=757.81s)

before they get to re-regulate adequately and move back to healthy relationship to it and depending upon someone's caffeine metabolism which is you know largely genetic depending upon the health of their adrenal glands and their [[nervous system]] that can be a pretty huge variance but there are people who when they cycle off of pretty intensive caffeine usage are still [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=783.459s)

dealing with side effects of coming off for three months wow for the time period that people are dealing with that it's actually really important to not get back on caffeine because you really want your system to refined its homeostasis right to find its amino dynamics and there are things one can do to support themselves they can try taking other kinds of [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=812.17s)

stimulants as a way of stepping down and then getting off those too so beaut amin which is a synthetic version of b1 which effectually up regulates the sensitivity of the d1 and d2 dopamine receptors which are partially affected and down regulated by the caffeine can actually help someone come off of it faster and easier and so bunam een and tyrosine together often can be utilized for that [839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=839.41s)

adrenal support in general b vitamins adaptogenic herbs and mostly more than anything is just a lot of sleep sleep banking so when people are coming off of having been on too much caffeine or any kind of stimulant for a long time taking three or four days where they just sleep as much as they can even if that's twelve or sixteen hours a day can make a tremendous difference to how quickly [868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=868.69s)

someone feels better their cognitive function increases their physiologic function increases damn well like i was telling you before i only took two weeks off about a month ago and as we were talking it sounds like my you know i've overused caffeine to a huge extent for a very long time and i probably have to go back in and take some more time off and i didn't get any headaches whatsoever [898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=898.6s)

but one of the worst things for me was i was just incredibly irritable like the smallest things would would agitate me or stress me out i felt just this enormous amount of pressure when nothing had changed other than i stopped drinking coffee it was it was a crazy feeling right yeah coming off of caffeine is again it's going to be much harder for some people based on genetics [924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=924.58s)

and others much harder for some people based on how dependent they were on it factoring all those things how long they've been doing it they were doing adrenal exhaustion but in the cases where someone's dependence on it is stronger caffeine informer is a good website and they give a good breakdown of caffeine in different products and science around caffeine [949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=949.63s)

metabolism etc but if you read on there even though they're a website that you know is supportive of people understanding caffeine and the positives of it well when you read about the experiences of people who are going through withdrawals and come downs many of them sound a lot like people coming off of stronger stimulants like meth in terms of experiencing irritability [972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=972.49s)

anxiety and then worse even depersonalization d realization so and just to kind of step back from chemo caffeine for a minute like even meth is a cool molecule it's one that again people regulate too so quickly and it creates it creates override independence in the dopaminergic system so quickly and so many side effects i just really don't [999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=999.1s)

recommend but no it was used so widely in in the you know 50 g's before we recognized all the issues of it and and adderall now is an impediment it's just you know the only different methamphetamine and adderall is one methyl group but like all of these things have the possibility of positive therapeutic application take exercise right people can exercise in ways where [1030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1030.63s)

they exceed what their body should do and they injure themselves rather than benefiting themselves and so pretty much anything even if it can be good for you or really is good for you in most applications can also be used irresponsibly and the more powerful something is the more one has to be mindful and the less one has been mindful the higher the probability that [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1057.06s)

there has been something responsible use right i love that perspective i appreciate that i'm gonna i'm going to give it another shot so what i want to dive into neuro hacking the company you own is called neuro hacker collective and i think everyone out there has heard of the term neuro hacking but i think there probably a lot of misunderstandings and [1079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1079.75s)

myths surrounding the word so first off can you just describe briefly what neuro hacking is so we'll describe the way that we think of it and kind of how we define it so neural hacking for us is utilizing any kinds of tools technologies processes they have the ability to up regulate some aspect of brain or [[nervous system]] function or associated body function that then [1113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1113.32s)

affects brain or [[nervous system]] function largely for the purpose of being able to up regulate some aspect of cognitive or emotional function we're specifically looking at the mind brain interface mostly now we could of course look at the brain just for its effect on the body like increased coordination and you know sentry systems motor systems and that's also kind of in the periphery of [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1139.03s)

it we're largely looking at how do we support the body to affect the mind and emotions also can we do with mind and emotions to affect the body and brain and how do we kind of hack the mind brain interface for both better [[subjective experience]] and increased capacities and how do we do it in ways that are not just upregulating to some capacity in the moment but with side [1164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1164.17s)

effects and down regulation of something meaningful long-term but how do we do it in a way that is sustainable regenerative and we're actually more focused on up regulating regulatory capacity itself rather than just up regulating some particular kind of stimulus in a way that might override the integrity of the system what do you mean can you explain that last bit a [1186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1186.37s)

little bit further sure so let's say we're going to talk about stimulants again stimulants are tools of neural hacking but most of them most of them don't fit it to what would consider good neural hacking tools so let's say we take adderall there are outside of its medical application there are many people who take adderall or other kinds of smart drugs stimulants to [1212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1212.139s)

be able to launch their tech startup to get to their taxes to do their midterms or finals whatever it is because they're having a hard time focusing adequately and this is a helping them so adderall is primarily working on your dopamine system it's a presynaptic dopamine agonist so it's making your neurons produce more dopamine and dopamine is involved in the ability to focus and [1237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1237.429s)

drive right so if you're trying to do something that is kind of easy to procrastinate and get distracted from increased focus and driver pretty great now how does the body naturally produce and regulate dopamine right if we think of what we call the endogenous dopamine's regulatory system or the internal dopamine regulatory system there's a [1261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1261.549s)

whole lot of things that happen right you eat protein that contains phenyl alanine the phenyl alanine is a protein have to get digestive get absorb to the gut the phenylalanine converts to tyrosine converts to an acetyl tyrosine converts to l-dopa converts to dopamine goes across a synapse passes a bunch of enzymes that are trying to break it down mao-b comt etc gets received into some [1283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1283.629s)

postsynaptic neurons there's like there's a bunch of things that happen to have a regulated dopamine process and we don't want kind of peak dopamine all the time right if you are wanting to have kind of intense focus concentration recognize patterns the body will naturally up regulate dopamine for that purpose if you're wanting to relax and meditate calm down make love participate [1307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1307.529s)

in some art you might want dopamine to drop a lot i want serotonin to come up right so your body is naturally regulating all of these chemicals in relationship to what's actually adaptive to the environment what's going on now so that regulatory cycle has the ability to pay attention to what's needed and then up or down regulate levels of anything and anything in relationship [1331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1331.45s)

with everything else that's going on now if i just give someone a presynaptic dopamine agonist if i give someone something that just basically is going to kind of elevate their dopamine and fix it then a few things happen one they're no longer as adaptive to their environment because their dopamine is not being internally regulated it's being externally [1351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1351.53s)

regulated which is why i love people on any kind of psychiatric meds it even if it stabilizes them that they describe is oftentimes feeling more numb because now their neuro chemistry and thus their emotional state is more than independent of what's happening so they don't feel their own ability to kind of respond to and react to and feel what's happening right that's not desirable one of the [1375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1375.83s)

other things that's happening if we kind of just fix the dopamine if the dopamine is elevated irrespective of all the things that it should exist in specific ratios in dynamic equilibrium with so the relationship of dopamine to them the other catecholamines norepinephrine epinephrine and it's relationship then on the other side the neuro inhibitory side to serotonin we did mess of all [1401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1401.51s)

those intentionally so now we start getting kind of weird imbalances in neuro chemistry and then because we're just elevating that enchain molecule and being able to keep it elevated the body's own ability to produce dopamine without it can start to drop which is what creates dependence we call addiction and the body's ability to the way its processing dopamine changes so [1428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1428.0s)

if dopamine starts being very high ongoingly without the body having produced it in the synapse then the body might start down regulating the dopamine receptor sensitivity because there's too much coming through and then if you get off of the adderall or meth or whatever it is now the natural amount of dopamine you produce is less than it was before [1451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1451.04s)

and your receptors are even less sensitive to dopamine because there was these higher amount now you're experiencing this pretty terrible withdraw and crash and so rather than just give someone a state we want to support their own brain body mind capacity to produce states that are relevant in response to the environment in real-time so that's [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1472.73s)

what we mean by up regulating the regulatory capacity of the system rather than overriding the regulatory capacity to just fix a specific state so something like adderall yes let's just take adderall so something like adderall will will go in and produce a ton of basically fill the brain with dopamine release all of it at once and then leave it in worse shape than it was in in the [1498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1498.95s)

first place and what you're kind of suggesting or what you what you guys are working on is things that can leave the brain and a better and better shape than when you found it yeah i mean when you think about i know your audience is a very connected to the crossfit world and if you think about the philosophy of the crossfit world and the sense of general preparedness and general capability for [1524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1524.18s)

lots of different kinds of activity the whole goal is increasing the adaptiveness of the being physically right that it is not someone that can just lift a lot of weight but can barely move or someone that could run fast but couldn't handle weight when it can come or it's a sense of kind of how do we make the being actually more responsive more adaptive increase the responsive [1550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1550.88s)

capacity and so there's ways of both stressing the system and then allowing it to repair and then stressing it in different ways and so similarly with our own internal physiology with our immune system we want an immune system that can respond better to different kinds of pathogens faster we want a repair system that can repair different kinds of injury faster right we want a [1574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1574.91s)

neurochemical system that when we want to focus can go into intense focus but when we need to be able to move our focus between a lot of things task switching we can move it between a lot of things without feeling stressed or irritated by something moving our attention so how do we increase our overall adaptiveness as a being now of course neural hacking doesn't imply that [1596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1596.81s)

a lot of like just if you're doing anything that is changing the way the [[nervous system]] operates for some no purpose that's a broad definition of neuro hacking i'm just taking the next steps to say the kind of neuro hacking we actually value and respect is the kind that went while it is enhancing some instantaneous capacity it is also in enhancing long-term capacity or at [1619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1619.759s)

minimum not damaging it love it i've got a two-part question for you next so first off before before we get deeper into optimizing brain function what are what are some of the prerequisites that people should be doing consistently before considering some of these neuro hacking supplementation these ways of supplementing and if they are not meeting those prerequisites are things [1649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1649.97s)

like nootropics neuro hacking supplementation it are they even beneficial mm-hmm and so with those prerequisites i'm talking i'm talking nutrition and lifestyle mainly sure it's a nuanced question so i'm going to answer it a couple ways this the first part is i would say to the degree that someone can have the foundational aspects of [1681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1681.98s)

lifestyle be with it it's not first and then any kind of enhancement be what they built off that foundation that's a good rule of thumb and so if someone for instance isn't sleeping well either they aren't getting dropping into deep delta sleep or they aren't getting enough sleep then a the starts taking immune support of herbs well most of the immune repair [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1711.2s)

only happens at night when sleeping and sharing delta sleep if you're not getting enough delta sleep those are just not going to do that much if you're taking things that are going to support a tissue synthesis most of the tissue repair happens during delta sleep if you're taking the topics that are going to support things like memory memory consolidation happens during delta sleep [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1735.98s)

and some aspects happen during sata sleep and so you're going to get a kind of tiny fraction of anything that you're taking that's going to help your regenerative capacity if you're not doing the foundational thing that is where regeneration occurs we can also look at diet and say alright say i'm going to take some supplements and i [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1755.63s)

take even if i take a handful of pills a day i'm still talking about a relatively tiny amount of grams in comparison to the total amount of food i eat per day and all of that food is chemistry that is not just macros that are competing my body fat muscle composition but they are all of the microbes that are affecting what my brain is made out of what my hormones are made out of what all my [1781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1781.37s)

tissues are made out of themselves and so all of that food is either medicine or toxicity or somewhere on that spectrum and so if somebody is taking in food that is not providing adequate nutrition and especially if it's providing toxicity and then they're going to try and just override that by taking supplements it's kind of like taking caffeine instead of sleeping [1808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1808.88s)

right it's just so the reason that the word supplement is used as it means in addition to right so if you think about maybe i think most people in your podcast will pray be familiar with this if you think about the way that like a turbocharger or supercharger added to an engine moves more oxygen through the engine so you can get more combustion a turbocharger without an engine doesn't [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1833.89s)

do anything at all right innately an engine without a turbocharger still does a lot and so if you think of the engine as lifestyle and you think about all the kind of hacking as like adding a badass turbocharger there's no question it can make you go a lot faster but it has to be on top of foundation otherwise it just doesn't work that well so now that's that's the main thing i would say [1858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1858.2s)

into the foundations everybody knows what the foundations are nobody likes to hear about them because they're hard and we don't really like doing them and we want like new  __  but i'm going to put to the sleep exercise movement food diet nutrition stress management reduction and you know those kinds of categories uh we can get into more things that you [1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1886.52s)

could fit in there but let's just let's just call those kind of the primary foundational categories i'm going to put sleep in its own category and say that if someone is having even the tiniest bit of sleep deficit it has a degree of negative effect on their whole system that a little bit of poor nutrition or a little bit of inadequacy and exercise just doesn't have got it interesting and [1918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1918.17s)

so as i mean we know that exercise affects the genetic transcription pattern of thousands of genes that's a huge  __  deal it's like our genome doesn't really matter that much genetic transcription matters because if you have a gene that's kind of sitting there quiet even if it does code for elevated homocysteine or whatever it doesn't matter right it only matters if it's [1943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1943.25s)

actually coding those those proteins are being built so you can change what is actually expressing genetically from lifestyle factors and so exercise you know profoundly if you're if you're looking at being able to affect thousands of genes that's a huge deal it's affecting exercise can up regulate bdnf which is brain derived neurotrophic factor up regulates the production of [1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1967.25s)

new neurons in your brain which prevents neurodegenerative disease repairs nerve damage increases cognitive emotional capacity i mean like if you've made a list of all things exercise can do and its effects on decreasing depression and decreasing likelihood for every kind of major chronic illness it's hard to imagine anything could be more powerful than that in the same a diet when you [1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=1992.78s)

think about all the negative effects of excessive sugar of so many kinds of processed foods of toxins that can be in foods of employment or foods and the positive effects of having your micronutrients be adequate adequate minerals vitamins etc yeah there's nothing like all of these categories are foundational if you get really great sleep but eat shitty you'll have [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2016.96s)

problems if you get you know really great exercise need shitty you'll have problems like there none of them replace the other ones but you will get more profound problems faster from sleep issues than any of the other ones so i really do think and it's such an easy one it's such an easy one to cut because it's just boring and life is interesting in this a lot of  __  we want to do and [2041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2041.02s)

it's so easy to have this like i'll sleep when i'm dead so give me more caffeine like i want to do stuff one of the things that is fascinating to me is in the sleep deprivation studies as someone is in moving into deeper degrees of sleep deprivation in time so what one thing that's very interesting say someone naturally wakes after 8 hours sleep and so instead they set their [2064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2064.149s)

alarm and they were going to get to bed on time but they like check one last email or did one thing so they now they just got seven and a half hours sleep that still seems like a lot a lot of people when you get sick 7 a half i'm pretty good but it's actually a half hour sleep debt if you add that up times a lot of nights right it doesn't take that very doesn't take very long for it [2087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2087.28s)

to be missing a whole night of sleep and you think about how someone feels in that case and then missing weeks of sleep reading as it goes on time that really happens and so we'll notice that some of the symptoms are things like verbal fluency and word recall if you're looking for a word or you're looking for a name it's kind of on the tip of your tongue but it takes a minute to find it [2109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2109.33s)

that's a pretty classic sign of sleep debt and that shouldn't be that's not just like aging or being human or having a high iq that's actually a sign that your brain is not functioning that well and it can be from different reasons but it's most commonly asleep that if you just completely  __  forgot where you parked or where you put your keys or your phone or what you were doing last [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2135.13s)

or you know something like that so you're short memory has that level of capacity for impairment that's that's not normal that's actually a sign of dysfunction and the most common reason for it is sleep now it can be for other reasons it can be new nutrition deficiency it can be stress overload it can be exposure to toxins neurotoxins mold etc but sleeps [2156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2156.45s)

the most common one and sleep helps with all those other things so one of the interesting things though is that as someone is moving into sleep debt at first they notice it and they go oh i'm a little bit tired if they had been sleeping well and then they're like oh i'm getting more tired but as someone gets deeper into sleep debt they stop recognizing that they're getting deeper [2179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2179.069s)

into sleep debt and so there is actually a mismatch between someone's own self-assessment of how much sleep debt is there and how much like that's actually there it's very much like drunk people who can't recognize how drunk they are because their brain is mis assessing it the tired brain is mis assessing this also from just an evolutionary adaptation right like think [2202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2202.079s)

about mothers who have an infant baby they're just not going to get enough sleep for a while right unless unless they just have one of those magical babies that sleeps all night long and they have a husband that does a lot maybe a nanny in a community they're going to go through a period of sleep that and so to be aware of how much they were in sleep that would just suck so [2221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2221.849s)

they just kind of be there's this evolutionary adaptation to be less aware of it but the problem of course is that we can then exploit that lack of awareness to keep going and so most people will have a situation where they're like say only operating at seventy percent of capacity but they only but they think they're operating at ninety percent of capacity and that miss [2244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2244.109s)

assessment is actually the court with the cause of a lot of problems so when you were asking about foundations i really do put sleep in its own category and then next i'm going to put nutrition and what people are taking in their mouth i'm going to put movement i want you know exercise will be a subset of that and i'll put the relationship to stress which is going to have to do with the relationships in their life the nature of their work the way they create meaning how they've processed old trauma whether they give themselves time to meditate journal etc do things to process it now then we can put other categories like someone's home environment that's kind of a big deal if they live in a house that say has mold [2291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2291.299s)

in it or they live in an environment that's actually dangerous so they're stressed out all the time or dealing with physical stressors or they're around people who are either particularly negative or have lifestyle habits that influence them in the wrong direction so environment people and physical environment can really kind of be are you another foundational category [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2311.039s)

tell you what let's let's stop it right there i want to pull on a couple of those categories and yeah and i'm realizing that we could have a four-hour conversation and not not get through everything i wanted to get through so i'm just going to i'm just going to go down a couple of these different avenues first off the the that miss assessment is absolutely fascinating because one of [2334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2334.079s)

the things i was going to bring up is that so many people they think they're operating at a hundred percent and when you you know when you suggest a couple things whether it be you know nutrition or sleep advice they they don't really see the point because they feel like they are operating at a hundred percent um i'm curious what are are there any like kind of biggest bang for your buck [2359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2359.76s)

type interventions or changes that you think most or all people should make all is obviously not not going to work but most people are deficient in and need to change in their diet and their diet yes this is a lot of things and it is there are some things that are true across the board and there's a lot of things they're going to be different for different goals and different [2392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2392.76s)

physiologies you had asked me previously a question about a diet that focuses mostly only on macros and being flexible with it if someone is focused on their physique and so they want to make sure that they are you know burning more calories than they are consuming in a day or consuming just enough of their big growing muscle so they're really kind of macro focused [2421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2421.68s)

and being more flexible with which macros which foods they can get their macros from so they can actually sustain that for a while we totally get why that diet evolved and it is grossly under aware of lots of things that are relevant other than just like short-term physique and flexibility of how one does that right right and so i mean i correct me if i'm wrong but i think that what [2446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2446.07s)

you might mean is like most people that follow that kind of diet are uninformed on the importance of micronutrients so a few things micros micronutrients is going to be the first thing about that diet that is also several other things welcome to you could you potentially follow that kind of diet but also keep in mind all of your micronutrients kind of okay i'm [2470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2470.1s)

going to keep going so macros are you know where you get calories from right protein fat carbs and someone this is the normal definition but someone can also kind of think of water and fiber as macros they're not caloric sources but they're things you need a lot of each day right but then your micronutrients are your vitamins fat soluble water soluble vitamins your minerals your [2500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2500.16s)

macro minerals and your trace minerals and then all the phytochemicals and polyphenols and enzymes and etc that come from a natural diet and a wide variety of natural foods you could say well can't i just take a multivitamin multi-mineral and not kind of worry about that i would say that's better than not doing it and a far away from actually having a evolutionarily [2529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2529.11s)

relevant diet because the form of nutrients from natural sources let's just say from a plant source it could be plant or animal source you'll have a plant that has a mineral that is bound in multiple different forms so you know you're not just going to be dealing with say salary you'll have you'll have sodium as a little bit of sodium chloride and sodium [2561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2561.02s)

bicarb and sodium by phosphate and you know many different forms you'll have you take a magnesium supplement and maybe it's magnesium citrate the body has give or take 13 different forms of magnesium that we know of that utilizes and very differently in different kinds of tissues so magnesium for brain health versus magnesium for its kind of electrolyte properties or in muscles or [2588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2588.48s)

heart or adrenals different forms natural foods do a better job of giving you a wider variety of those things also often times with cofactors some of which won't be in the multi some of which we don't even understand that well that will affect absorption and then things that we don't even usually think of as micros like all of the antioxidants and all the polyphenols all of the [2613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2613.77s)

plant-based enzymes etc so those matter a lot and what we know about life extension right now kind of the best thing we still know about life extension we know you know quite a few things is caloric restriction is meaningful for life extension in all mammals including humans and but when we look at the people from blue zones who have who lived the oldest the areas where you [2644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2644.85s)

have the most people that live over 100 there their diets can be a little bit different but one of the commonalities is that there they are in general taking in less calories than we are there in slight caloric deficit but they're taking their calories from micronutrient rich sources so their diet is lower in macronutrients higher and micronutrients which means they you know are in caloric [2668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2668.22s)

restriction being a nutrient restriction interesting got it which is the exact opposite of empty carbs right so this is why getting food from organic biodynamic local seasonal rotating whole food etc sources actually makes a big difference as all of those other compounds now that's one thing right is that actually getting the good things from food love it macros is [2707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2707.19s)

really important one on the other side not getting bad things from food is also really important and not getting bad things from food means inflammatory compounds so if and this is going to be a little bit the same for everyone and a little bit different most people will have inflammatory reactions or have a probability of having inflammatory reactions from a lot of common things so [2733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2733.859s)

pasteurized dairy hybridized grains excessive sugar etc those are all going to be probably inflammatory for most people and you're not just talking about inflammation in the joint you're talking about internal inflammation throughout like systemic throughout the body right yes starting in the gut and then having systemic effects that originate in the gut and other are there is there [2763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2763.26s)

anything any kind of identifying markers that people can look for it yeah yeah rather than than just going to a lab uh-oh i thought you were asking lab markers that's okay too yeah yeah the easiest the easiest first so again this is tricky because there are a lot of different inflammatory markers and different ones show up first for different people so the inflammatory markers that in a normal non-functional medicine doc will most commonly run is the run crp and sed rate and maybe homocysteine and those are primarily kind of cardiac inflammatory markers that are predispositions for heart disease there are plenty of people that actually have full-blown inflammatory diseases where none of those are elevated they we might [2824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2824.31s)

see calprotectin elevated showing inflammation in the bowels and we can have kind of inflammatory bowel disease without any about the heart and plummet or markers we can see specific cytokines that are elevated that are going to lead to autoimmune diseases like lupus rheumatoid arthritis or pebble miles or pmr so and then there are people who have like elevated histamine maybe just [2852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2852.119s)

genetically that leads to inflammation you'd have to kind of specifically look at that including neuro inflammation or who have leptin sensitivity which you can see through different markers like like adina pectin which lead to sensitivity to lectin rich foods so one thing i would say here is for people who are interested in optimizing health going to work with a good functional [2883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2883.04s)

medicine doctor who can kind of take in their symptoms take in their goals and then prioritize labs with them and create customized protocols highly recommended think about this think about all the times you heard about someone who got some intense headache went to the doctor had a brain scan found out they had a pretty serious brain tumor and they got diagnosed a few months left [2908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2908.28s)

to live but they were completely asymptomatic and that brain tumor was growing for years similarly and whether it's a brain tumor or tumour anywhere else the absence of symptom does not mean the absence of pathogenesis you can have the development of pathology a symptomatically for a long time and when we're looking at autoimmune disease when someone starts [2935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2935.22s)

having enough joint pain that they actually go check it out and they get diagnosed with rheumatism it's not uncommon to see autoimmune antibodies or inflammatory cytokines years and sometimes even decades before someone would have got that diagnosis from symptomology why that's a big deal from a preventive medicine point of view is if you see the early signs of it and the [2959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2959.34s)

person doesn't have the symptoms it can very easily mean they never have to get them because you can stop and you can prevent progress of the disease and usually even reverse it if you know what you're doing when you get those markers so you know if someone is in symptomology then obviously go tend to it but if someone is really interested in you know you're trying to optimize [2980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=2980.88s)

your fitness and your energy levels and your health right now but you want to keep optimizing those rather than have them you know degrade relatively rapidly in age then having a sense of what's really going on in your body and being able to address things ahead of time and have a personalized approach based on what's actually going on for you is a good idea and is any is just any [3007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3007.22s)

functional med doctor acceptable or there are there certifications and identifying marker marks for those doctors that you would recommend people seek out tricky one of the things that is on our goal list for the for our company is actually being able to make a directory of functional doctors and other kinds of therapists that can recommend people in whatever city [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3039.44s)

someone's in based on what kinds of trainings they've done in reviews etc there's certainly there's certainly some things you can look for so functional medicine is a specific branded thing the institute of functional medicine is it has very training's and some of the better trainings that are kind of standardized right now you can also look at just [3063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3063.859s)

people who call themselves naturopathic doctors and integrative doctors and just kind of see if what they are doing is relevant for what your interests are obviously if you have some gi issues having a integrative or functional doctor who has some gi specialty or if you're trying to build a lot of muscle have one that is good at ormond optimization right you want to look at [3088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3088.849s)

whatever your goals are someone who has some specialization and experience with those topics and then right now the best you can probably do is check out reviews and then go meet them and see if you resonate done so originally i wanted to really dive into you know nootropics and different neuro hacking techniques as well as longevity but it you know for the for most of this conversations it's [3117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3117.41s)

been kind of like what are the what are the precursors people need to have down before they consider that type of thing which i think is a great starting place so before before we wrap up i know people are going to have a ton of questions about the nutrition piece what are one two or three resources that you would recommend people go to that are you know widely varied and also [3142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3142.97s)

digestible for for laypeople in terms of micronutrients and and that kind of that sort of thing mm-hmm music i think nutrition is actually one of the trickiest topics there is so much vested interest and people who have kind of authored books and just hold to a particular ideology of the kind of food people want to eat of the associated [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3175.249s)

morality and ethics and lifestyle and culture elements that there are very few topics that are less coherent across the whole field than this one medicine does not like within the field of integrative medicine there's not as much intense difference as there is in foundational nutrition similarly there's not that much difference in in thought on sleep so i mean a classic [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3200.839s)

example is people who are in the you know more raw food and more vegan and more kind of calorie restriction direction and then people who are in the more ketogenic diet primal diet paleo direction they both reference a lot of well done science right and there are really good scientists and doctors on both sides of that and they both look at blue zone studies but in very different [3234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3234.47s)

ways some of it's because it's going to be different for different peoples genetics for different peoples physiology how they approach it etc so i would say there are general rules of thumb to say one should eat closer to the living ecosystem is a generally good rule of thumb meaning the more processed and packaged hybridized sprayed etc something is the worse it is in general [3266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3266.599s)

it's not an absolute truth but it's a general truth and closer to things that have been what our bodies evolved to eat over very long periods of time and particularly also with less pesticides and herbicides and things that are designed to kill life on them and the more they come from healthy soils rather than pretty demineralized soils and the fresher they are versus they've been out [3291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3291.2s)

of the ground for pretty long time these are all you know in to the degree it's meats then grass-fed free-range etc that's kind of important across the board whether you're eating meats or not or these ones are not or nitrates or not like kind of dial that and second dial in this general approach to things that would have been part of a living ecosystem first and i would say then the [3316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3316.759s)

next good rule of thumb is paying attention to how you feel as pretty closely as you eat different things so pay attention right after miel do you have a sense of over fullness in your belly like you're having a hard time digesting it do you have gi symptoms afterwards you get tired after eating in do you get hungry again right away do you have energy for [3340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3340.64s)

a while though do you sleep well afterwards the more you can do kind of a really attentive quantified self assessment just even spend a few weeks and journal what you're eating and then journal how you're feeling in association and dial it in the combination of the general rule of thumb of eating evolutionarily relevant foods and paying attention to which ones feel [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3364.369s)

good for you that would be foundational then study specific diets on top of that and then do actual functional medicine where you look at your nutrient levels and your you know food allergies etc on top of that in terms of resources to go study more the reason why i was hesitant to say the resources is they mostly all fall into camps that are very different than other camps so have good things to [3388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3388.25s)

say so i think dave asked freeze nubuck headstrong is one of the best introductions to health for people who have not got into it yet that i'm aware of i think it is a you know people take different through lines of how they write a book like that whether it's under any healthy fats or whether it's on the same caloric restriction the through line he took was cellular health [3414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3414.799s)

mitochondrial energy and brain that's a great through line and so then he looked at diet and exercise and sleep and toxicity and hacking techniques in light of that and you know i think a lot of what he has in the book is really foundationally great it's not going to be appropriate for everyone people will want to modify but i think it's a great starting place in terms of other people [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3437.66s)

that have a similar issue philosophy a lot of what dr. mercola writes on diet is kind of similar and again clinically well backed up if you go speak to a normal cardiologist they're still looking at pretty ken's work on extremely low fat diets having lower heart disease living longer and more mediterranean diet i think that is largely just older research but but [3468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3468.4s)

not irrelevant and i have seen people do blueproof diet ketogenic diet a little bit wrongly and have their lipid profile gets super whacked and so there is some need for nuance and i actually think a lot of the raw food vegan communities has good things to say on diet even if you decide not to be vegan you decide to eat some other you know animal products with it a lot of the insights on soil [3499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3499.06s)

conditions and micronutrients and plants and therapeutic use of herbs and whatever there is great so those are a few that's excellent i appreciate that so it sounds like there is no perfect diet like one size fits all which is kind of a you know that's that's the case in just about everything in life right there are rules of thumb there are generalized [3525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3525.88s)

principles and then there's a lot of room for adaptation like what someone should eat if they are training heavily versus not and training for powerlifting versus ultramarathons and you know based on their genetics and age and what kind of medical conditions they have that's all going to just be so so different one thing i will also say is be the idea that someone should not [3551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3551.94s)

do kind of more advanced neuro hacking biohacking things if they don't have the foundations down this is not totally correct i wanted to take that perspective first because i wanted to emphasize foundations but say we look at either use of no tropics or you said eeg neurofeedback or different kinds of sleep tech sometimes even if someone's foundations are screwed they're screwed [3582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3582.31s)

enough that the person's behavioral chemistry is out of whack enough that they just can't fix it it can't actually get themselves to eat better exercise well you know sleep well regularly enough and sometimes those interventions actually help the person enough that not only do they get the benefit of that intervention but it helps them get the [3603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3603.1s)

foundation's down better to change their behavior right absolutely so like one of the things that you know we have found with you know with quality and nootropics is if people are having issues with sleep if their underslept or if they have kind of overuse stimulants they might need to fix that first but otherwise if say their diet is poor or their exercises poor it's been very [3628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3628.78s)

common that people will start i mean not all know perfectly the same quality specifically has a lot that balances that dopamine opioid access so it's actually helping work on the chemistry systems of motivation and behavior themselves we've had a lot of people who just couldn't get themselves to be regular with exercise and diet they got on that and then they actually were so [3658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3658.96s)

the general rule of thumb is someone does want to be focused on foundations but if they're having a really hard time focusing with foundations finding tools that can not support them to keep not doing foundations and things that they can just augment it but things that can actually help them with the behavioral dynamics of doing the foundation will work that can be super useful that's a [3679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3679.359s)

great perspective i love that even if it even if it is a placebo that gets them to change the behavior then the important part is that they are changing their behavior which oftentimes is the most important piece so the fact that what you guys do is so holistic and you know has such a long term effects is just that much better i love it yeah and you know sometimes sometimes [3706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3706.21s)

foundations first and then two advanced techniques we can also say if the advanced techniques can help you be able to do a better job of foundations that you've had this new year's goals every year and not actually been able to stabilize don't keep trying and failing it the same thing see if additional tools can support you right i love that so look i am really dying to continue [3754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3754.42s)

this conversation we've opened so many doors but we're going to have to save some of it for the next time what what do you have what do you want to leave these listeners with or do you have an ask of them i enjoyed the time with you and i'm looking forward to the next time and if this was interesting and people have questions on other topics my ass would be they just tell you what they're [3785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3785.65s)

interested in that we talk about next time and other than that my ask would be that they take more responsibility for their own health and well-being in life and they did previously and that means study more so they can actually understand how to support themselves because that will put them not just in the best position for their own health but also in the best position to help [3811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-bWt2y1VE&t=3811.359s)
