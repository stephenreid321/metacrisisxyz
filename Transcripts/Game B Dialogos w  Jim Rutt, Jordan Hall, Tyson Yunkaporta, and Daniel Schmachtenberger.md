music times music welcome everyone to the stoa it's pretty wild here in toronto right now with the snow today and lots of energy in the the collective field so i hope everyone is safe and sound and if you're here now you probably just watched the premiere of a film [32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=32.32s)

initiation to [[game b]] on the stowa's youtube channel and this was a film that was written directed and animated by jake ruiz who's here today and produced by jim jeff gomez and uh and jake all of who are here today so i'm going to take in jim in a moment but how today is going to work is uh jim is going to [54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=54.96s)

talk to the three j's who created this film they're gonna have a quick discussion about the film and then jim's gonna take me back in and then i'll introduce the epic deal logos panel that we have today that includes jim jordan hall and tyson yonkaporta and daniel schmuckenberger and they'll be talking for about 45-60 minutes and then maybe we'll have some time for some [74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=74.96s)

questions so if you have questions any time during the the panel talk just put in the chat and then if we have time i'll call you you can meet yourself and you can ask your question to the panel so that being said i gotta give jim unmute access jim uh you're up my friend alrighty thanks peter uh thanks a lot [92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=92.56s)

for putting this together uh yeah this is uh very exciting uh this uh this been a lot of work from a lot of folks to get us to this moment uh i thought i'd start with just a little bit of history of the project that started out i don't know a little over two years ago on the gamebee group site on facebook i believe there was some talk hey you know we need to [115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=115.119s)

move out of the world the word of just words and get our word out in art you know art speaks to a different part of the brain i said well you know i'm a word dude you know my art i'm about as good as art as nobody you've ever met my high art form might be a construction pencil on a on a grocery bag to design a deer stand or something like that so uh i started [142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=142.0s)

putting feelers out and saying hey anybody uh working on art in uh in the [[game b]] space and chatted a couple people nothing really clicked and then jake ruiz reached out directly to me and you know i i don't even know if he knew i was looking did you know i was looking jake nope uh he said i got an idea and we we had a convos we all i do all the time [165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=165.84s)

with folks and we really clicked and i said wow i really really like this guy's vision let's see where it goes so we started a process which uh took a while and eventually uh resulted in this movie so let me um let's film i guess jake always bashes me whenever i say movie he says you know that's you know cheesy old people say [188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=188.319s)

that this is a film so yes uh so now we have we're ready to launch our film here so let me introduce the other two jays uh jake i call our fence a principal filmmaker uh he runs a creative agency futurity that utilizes an integral methodology to align organizations to their purpose and design he designs content for effective transmedia [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=212.799s)

communication strategies uh our other jay is jeff gomez he's been exceedingly helpful i refer to him as our narrative guru jeff's the ceo of starlight runner which is recognized as a premier consultant in the fields of brand narratives story world development creative franchise design and transmedia storytelling we're amazingly lucky to have a dude of the [239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=239.36s)

punching power of jeff on our on our project so uh and i guess i'm the third jay and uh me i'm kind of the head janitor of the [[game b]] movements about all i could say so uh with that uh you know let's uh i'd like to turn it over to jake to talk a little bit about uh the process [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=261.84s)

and uh you know how he went about it and all the things that were not all things some of the things that were involved thank you jim yeah jake here uh peter it's a great honor thank you for hosting the film here and holding this event with all the game bogs present the sheer amount of sagely wisdom in this room will surely [285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=285.68s)

break something right uh and i'd especially like to thank our executive producers the brett family aka the medicis of [[game b]] uh so you know every artist needs its needs amused right and and perhaps our old muses like [309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=309.52s)

secular individualism have aged and withered and need to be put to rest uh for me as a protopian vision you know [[game b]] is like a sexy person who's always walking ahead of you into the future they'll always have their issues but day by day they encourage you to transform your head heart and body [329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=329.6s)

and be more of a team player uh so my hope for this film is is simply that it will encourage artists who create you know anything from memes to speculative dreams uh that their vision uh to share their vision with [[game b]] of [[game b]] you know future that they'd feel a little more proud to leave their descendants [354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=354.16s)

uh and we'll keep iterating together until we accelerate the exodus out of game 8. uh i won't talk too much about the process i want to give the ma the the panelists uh the time here so with that i'll introduce the master of trans media mr jeff gomez oh you're on mute there jeff right how about that there we go okay well um uh people it's so fantastic to be here this is um the realization of a little tiny dream i've had since uh first hearing uh the term uh [[game b]] uh from jordan hall um this was uh [401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=401.6s)

some years ago and um and being uh so privileged to be able to sit in on on these talks these discussions and learn that there were people uh all over the world who were thinking about the uh systemic crises that that we face as as a human race um and as custodians to to the earth that people [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=427.36s)

were actually thinking about solutions that were systemic a systemic approach to um to solving these problems was astonishing astonishing because i come from uh the realms of fantasy and science fiction so the only way uh that uh myself and and people of my background have had to to communicate such ideas [451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=451.36s)

was through uh you know science fiction and um uh and here we are uh sitting talking to each other about real world solutions to to these problems now i have to admit um sometimes i would sit on these conversations and not understand what the hell you were talking about [473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=473.84s)

um it can be dense the language can be uh uh you know rarified and and yet um uh the fact that that people like me can have access to to this um to this the very nature of what [[game b]] is about is uh is the ability for us to mix and match our skills and our perspectives to come up with unexpected answers so um i began to implore uh jordan and daniel schmokenberg and jim rutt can't we find ways to communicate these [522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=522.0s)

ideas to the people to the population i'm from a background that's used to placing a megaphone in front of popular storytellers why can't i apply those skills to get some consensus of what [[game b]] is and and help to defeat it to an artist like jake or or a team like jake uh jim and myself and come up with something [554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=554.0s)

that distills some of these basic concepts and and so uh we we got together and um and then asked some of you some questions and we compiled i think a list of of wonderful traits uh uh some of which made into made it into this uh [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=575.12s)

animated uh film um so i'm really proud of the journey that that we made um i i think it's wonderful and um i'm i'm very interested in what everyone here has to say about it i'm also interested in of course spreading the word uh showing others and interpreting the film uh for others so [596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=596.8s)

that we could um actually you know start answering uh some of these fundamental questions uh very good the i'd also like to just mention uh that we had a lot of help from what was called we called our editorial advisors number of people have been in and around the [[game b]] world for uh quite a while and i'm just going to read them [627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=627.519s)

off uh jordan hall daniel schmokenberger tyson yucca porta nora bateson zach stein brett weinstein uh mark allen kaplan uh alex alexander byner peter wang mcrocks velfon horn bruce kunkel sharon lewis uh nicholas limbacher and ellie hayne [650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=650.0s)

all of whom had some input into the into the project uh many of whom were interviewed in depth uh by jake and jeff and this uh film uh wouldn't be what it was without them though of course as always all faults and errors are ours all right you ready jim i am ready so uh let me introduce the three folks that will be uh joining me on the panel uh first uh jordan hall uh you know he and i have been working on what eventually became [[game b]] since back in 2008 i believe uh you know a [698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=698.0s)

long time ago and he's the co-founder of the civilian project and an intrepid explorer into the deep code of civilization design and dynamics uh and uh always good for a very interesting and deep conversation uh tyson yonkopora is a senior lecturer in indigenous knowledge at deakin university in melbourne australia he's a member of the appalach clan in far north [726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=726.16s)

queensland and he carves traditional tools and weapons he is also the author of what i consider one of the best books of the last few years and an indispensable read for anybody in [[game b]] land and that sand talk if you haven't read it read it uh daniel schmuckenberger is a founding member of the consilience project aimed at improving public [[sensemaking]] and dialogue the through line of his interests has been has been with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and societies with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal so that be us uh let's take it away the question that we want that we put to the panel we'll [770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=770.0s)

start with the question uh actually i'll ask the panelists to give a short take on uh what they thought of the movie say no more than a minute and then speak to the role of the arts in the unfolding of [[game b]] and then after each of us has our chance at the question uh we'll have a general discussion about what's going on [792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=792.32s)

uh in and around the [[game b]] world so uh jordan why don't you go first if i just jump in before jordan if everyone could besides the panelists just shut their camera off it helps the youtube video pick it up and create some intimacy uh when the deal logos is over i'll jump in turn on my camera and then we'll play with the q a so off you go jordan i was gonna punt into [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=812.32s)

the other panelists under the premise that i was gonna be the craziest one and then i realized who else was on the panel so sorry you're just stuck um okay so maybe let me work backwards on the last piece because it made me laugh a little bit um i've been on on and on in that sense like rambling on [832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=832.639s)

about this notion of art for the past maybe two months or so with the mindset of saying we we typically get very stuck i think in the way something has shown up in in sort of our memory or our life experience so the notion of art in our world in the world that most of [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=854.72s)

us are familiar with perhaps not everybody here oftentimes is identified with what i would just call artifacts so stuff made out of stuff oftentimes in shapes or colors paintings and uh statues but also music but it's it's that kind of thing this stuff the greek sensibilities of the muses but my my sense of it is that that's not [876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=876.399s)

really what art is it's art it's how art has shown up and that rather the notion of art has to do with the particular capacity to express by means of access to what forest lander would refer to as the transcendent so there is a way of navigating the world that is governed by certain rules of mind right [898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=898.72s)

so for example logic etc and there's a way of navigating the world governed by a different set of rules and like all those transcendent rules the rules of feeling or of quality or vibes if you're a gen zed and i would say that that simply is art art is the the actual capacity to navigate the world by means of this [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=919.76s)

other modality and i would propose that the shifting into or in some sense the return the remembering of how to live life artfully is in much the essence of this concept of [[game b]] right to move from a way of living life effectively or an optimizing way which is very much of the essence of game a moving into [941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=941.68s)

living life artfully in this modality is very much of the essence of [[game b]] or at least with the transition in the context of the the film or the what would you call digital animated short i suppose if you want to be pedantic evan as we know any given expression is going to be what [964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=964.0s)

it is so it captures what it can capture expresses that it can express and what i noticed when i watched it and more importantly actually when i watched it with my daughter who's three was that um it conveyed certain feelings that seemed to be what i would say right or in alignment meaning [982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=982.48s)

i felt a feeling in my heart when the heart feeling was being called and more importantly again my daughter seemed to and she reacted to it in a very particular way and she's asking a bunch of questions she was very curious about what was going on uh i would say by the way that what seemed to be the most powerful thing for [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1000.32s)

her was the the girl and the beginning and the girl in the end and the realization that that girl was a human and then noticing this other place that was pretend and what it was like to feel the relationship between the human and the pretend um so it's interesting right one of the things that happens when you're interacting with things in the artistic is it's open people will be we begin to dig into it in ways that are um well not only not obvious but [1032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1032.16s)

in not necessarily at all with respect to what the explicit intent or the the mental notion of the artist would be and it's the invitation into the inquiry that to me is more important like i don't the content is nice the content is good i told jeff i was uh surprised that jim let it actually show up the way that it showed up [1051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1051.6s)

um but the context and the degree to which it invites people into a certain kind of inquiry and a certain relationship with disposition i think that's nice that's a good good direction okay tyson let's hear your take well everyone i've like showed it to you [1076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1076.88s)

know my family and everything that just like punched in the air and saying yeah that's it you know i think um you know when you preached into the choir you know people are gonna love it um i i haven't i haven't tried it out yet on anybody who um who isn't already across all of the [1094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1094.64s)

concepts in it you know and um see this was my i was my qu my criticism main criticism of it was um you know it's an initiation but there's no ordeal but then i figured no no there's no ordeal because i already know what's in it and the people i showed [1114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1114.16s)

already know what's in it so they didn't feel a um you know a fear and danger response so there was no ordeal to go through but i imagine if someone's never come across those concepts before uh that would be something of an ordeal and a bit of a shock to the limbic system that would give them a bit of a jolt so yeah that's okay um and i guess uh you know for a lot of people i don't know i don't think everyone in the world is going to see it but i think if it really took off i think the main responses that you're gonna get will be negative is like well [[game b]] is all pale male stale non-indigenous able-bodied um dudes and um you know why do they have all these female and indigenous and people of color in eastern or whatever um avatars you know and and i don't know so there'll be like representation concerns but i think anyone coming from that [1173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1173.039s)

point of view if they had that view of history i think if they thought really thought it through then they might arrive at the conclusion of well that's it's appropriate that that's the demographic um of the majority of [[game b]] because you know you made the mess so you clean it up uh kind of thing i i think that would be [1191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1191.44s)

a more helpful critique i certainly haven't got a a problem with um you know with that demographic in in [[game b]] i think it's i think it's highly appropriate i think the people who understand the structure best are the people who made it um you know just as you jim you you understand the internet pretty well because you're one of the senior elders and founding fathers of the internet from my point of view because you've been around there for forever and um yeah i think that's the way i think it's it's it's very appropriate uh the demographics of [[game b]] but then at the same time it's going to be really important to get uh i think you know uh to achieve the goals the game be to have uh a nice uh some some bigger uh front doors and and bringing all kinds of people in and um and i think that's where the arts side of thing is gonna do it and i sort of see uh [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1246.48s)

i see the film as a good little leverage point um for making that happen looking forward to seeing it happen thanks tyson uh daniel i think the thing about the film that i liked the most uh there was a lot of content in it that was good it was really it's a trippy experience because i [1274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1274.32s)

didn't even know that it was happening until you sent it to me to watch um i think i had missed my emails um updating so it's trippy to like see all of the content that we've talked about put forward in a form like that for the first time but i think the thing that i'm happiest about is just that an investment into [1292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1292.88s)

other media and forms of communication and starting to think about artistic presentation is happening at all and the main thing i would hope is that it just inspires a lot more endeavors of totally different kinds someone said in here one of the things they preferred aesthetically about solarpunk was more [1311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1311.44s)

focused on the arts uh i think i think that is an area that has been deficient in some way in um our kind of thinking and community so far so i'm happy to see that and um i think the question was asked like what is the role of art and game be [1331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1331.76s)

i think it's a really good question and i'll just say the first couple thoughts that came to mind the first time i went to bali someone was telling me that an idea from the kind of ancient balinese culture is that they they said uh the art museum is the sign of a dead culture that has relegated art to a [1353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1353.36s)

place and that if a culture is not dead the entire civilization should be the art museum they humans should not build anything that isn't art and that they had this idea that nature is beautiful enough that we should only build something if it adds to the beauty of nature and that was actually core to their [1372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1372.72s)

thinking and that when you look at the temples and the streets there's this idea that anywhere the eye falls or anything that lands on the ears elevates consciousness that everything is art in a way that is consciousness elevating and when we when we realized that technology is not values agnostic that technology has inexorable effects on us it codes for patterns of behavior that [1392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1392.799s)

affect us like that the kind of ontologic design movement of how do we rebuild the human built world not just for the specific functional purposes but to elevate develop and enlighten the people in the relationships within it then art takes on a very central theme right like how how would if if we thought about everything in the built world how it lands on all of our senses having an elevating effect on consciousness i think that's a very interesting kind of artistic renaissance perspective for [[game b]] i was thinking about from uh you know the greek true good and beautiful triad there's a poem i wrote on her birthday to an artist friend of [1433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1433.52s)

mine once where i said something like that uh truth and goodness only matter because beauty is and it was kind of an exploration of like if reality was not inherently beautiful in a beyond visual sense but like beauty is the sense it's like the embodied sense of the inherent [1455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1455.2s)

meaningfulness of it i wouldn't give a about goodness i wouldn't give a about truth like i only actually even care to understand it and i care to serve it the true and the good because there's this inherent beauty in it and um and i was noticing how much truth and goodness were inherent to my pursuits [1473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1473.52s)

and yet it's all in service to the things that i that i see in people who live artfully um and then i think just the last thing i'll say there is a a pretty simple distillation of maybe everything that i have learned regarding how to live a meaningful human [1494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1494.72s)

life everything of being doing and becoming uh all kind of synthesizes down to appreciate the beauty of life add to the beauty of life develop your capacity to do both um and that the mode of being in its depth is really appreciating the beauty of existence as it is being able to take it in be moved by it be raptured by it [1517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1517.76s)

and that then the protective impulse and the creative impulse in their deepest sense the doing is to add to the beauty of life and if what you're creating is not adding to the beauty of life and the way the bolognese said then it's not the right thing to do and the mode of becoming the human development is really deep in your [1535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1535.679s)

capacity for being to appreciate and be with reality more and to add to the beauty of it more and the recursive relationship between those three doesn't really leave anything that i care about out and so if i was gonna kind of define the [[superstructure]] of [[game b]] uh i think that would be a decent starting [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1555.12s)

place well thank you thank you daniel uh now on my take on it it's uh you know jordan's was hey surprise jim let this thing out well uh i wouldn't have put quite the same emphases and weights and things on the various elements in the film but that's not what art's about right art's about [1576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1576.559s)

getting you in the heart and there's not a thing in the film that i disagree with i said i would emphasize different things but it struck me that the right thing to do uh was to let jake resonate with his artistic vision and i was supportive of that throughout and i think that's really really [1597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1597.679s)

important because to the degree that art becomes didactic it becomes propaganda and it's no longer art right so if we're going to have an art scene around [[game b]] we have to let the artists be the artists i think that's sort of just fundamental and not think of it as a branch of didactic uh instruction uh now of course there may be some things that are [1621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1621.279s)

didactic construction which instruction which includes some arts but that's not the same as a work of art and so i'm very uh very happy the way this thing has turned out as what i truly believe it to be which is a work of art from the artistic vision uh principally of jake with a little bit a little bit of contribution from from the rest of us uh in terms of the role of the arts uh [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1645.039s)

in [[game b]] uh you know one of my day jobs the degree i have one is the study of cognitive science and part of that goes into the study of personalities and learning and memory and one of the things that you learn when you start studying how that thing between our ears works is there's a lot of difference [1666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1666.48s)

amongst people and how their minds work uh you know there are some people who are very good at syllogisms and writing things down carefully and reading closely and being able to regurgitate it on standardized tests etc and then there are other people who are not some of those are some of the most brilliant and effective people i've ever met who experience the world [1690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1690.48s)

experientially who are saturated in it and to my mind uh for historical and accidental reasons [[game b]] was way overloaded with that first class of folks right some of the early discussions nerd fests of transcendental proportions right uh uh the the writing we did and some on some of our projects together group [1716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1716.64s)

writing was phenomenal but it was because we were those kinds of folks and actually it turned out to be important because i think it's built us a very deep base uh you know people sometimes will compare and contrast us with other [[game b]] adjacent uh uh movements and i say that's good because there are many many people on [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1735.44s)

this mission together and some of them have a more artistic temperament than we have so far but i am pretty proud of the deep deep digging that we have done over the last uh what was it eight years or so almost nine years now uh i guess 10 years you'll be coming up in march actually from the very earliest work but but you know this syllogistic logical approach is not how you get the word out uh to the world and so while we'll continue to dig and still a lot more digging to do a lot more intricate work to do in protocols and designs of various aspects governance systems software etc uh you know the time has [1777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1777.919s)

come to turn and tell the story in ways that the people who uh interact with the world experientially uh can can engage with and to my mind uh that is really the role of art and of course uh even for those of us who use a horrible popular cultural cliche are more left-brained don't believe that [1801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1801.12s)

left-brained right brain stuff by the way because it's well there's just sort of a little hint of something to it it's not nearly as black and white as people say but let's use it anyway us more left brain people i think we'll have our own understanding of our own work uh will expand tremendously when we get exposed to uh artistic reflections essentially of this work and will allow [1824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1824.159s)

the the work of digging to go off in whole new directions that we never would have seen i gotta say i mean this uh this film has caused me to think about the uh the journey to [[game b]] quite differently and uh for many other people who are you know you still recall in our early [[game b]] days there were some members uh who were probably more of this other tribe who complained that our [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1845.2s)

online world was a wall of words right and i go what would you expect yeah it's a bunch of words yeah that's what we're doing here well you know what uh that was stupid to me because there are a lot there were a lot of really valuable folks who could have contributed a lot more if instead of a just being a wall of words we had also [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1864.399s)

included uh you know some more artistic and aesthetic sensibilities and uh so i see that uh also as uh the role of the arts in [[game b]] uh you know i hope this is just the very first uh it's not actually not the first there been people have created [[game b]] poems and uh you know a little bit of music and such but not very much and i hope this is the beginning a little [1888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1888.32s)

pebble rolling down the hill that starts an avalanche and sees the deep hole of the deep work of the deep code to steal jordan's phrase of construction and logic and syllogisms and writing to be a a base from which the artistic representation of this new world that we [1910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1910.64s)

hoped uh to see come into existence uh can take fire and just start growing exponentially back to you music i'm peter sensing you or have a conversation for 45 minutes yeah open sweet we can just riff yeah about it i think i think that's [1945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1945.679s)

art has to be emerging and and it has to come from those liminal sort of places and i think if it's not then it's just propaganda and um i feel like [[game b]]'s resisted um the propaganda side of things really quite admirably so far and uh yeah and i feel like this one hasn't sort of just sort of dropped straight out of the center of things [1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=1967.6s)

but it's kind of uh emerged a bit and yeah i'd like to see more of that too if no one's jumping in like jordan said something to me about um the last week or week before it was about um it was about it's really stuck with me it's about being a um a [[game b]] loser in game a which is which is really cool so i've looked at myself and gone oh man i'm a i'm a [[game b]] loser in game hey like especially on this continent that's currently called australia however daniel if i go to bali which it's cheaper for me to fly to bali than it is to fly home on this continent and um suddenly i'm a game a winner in a place that was formally [2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2018.559s)

arguably already [[game b]] because i can just um stretch out my my hideous fat body on the beach and and get some young girl to to give me a massage for like two hours for five dollars or something so that makes me a game a winner in a [[game b]] place so i guess context is everything isn't it but while i'm here [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2039.919s)

[[game b]] loser and game a i think jordan's talking sorry i was on mute um we're trying to figure out how to thread the needle or to go through the eye of the needle it's like that metaphor figuring how to be a [[game b]] winner in [[game b]] and of course it's not easy one of the [2064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2064.48s)

things that we ran into a lot back in the pre-spore mode days was the the challenge of actually recognizing like really deeply recognizing the necessity of the vulnerability of the immaturity of [[game b]] you know there's often times there was a desire to be able to sort of specify something and specify something that was i think good but then try to get there by using the tools of game a including the mindset of game and so that doesn't work um but that's the precise thing that can't work it's what gets things in turns it [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2098.56s)

turns art back into propaganda right quick um and so being able to actually really really gently hold each of those pieces and learn how to have the sensitivity to know precisely when you're doing it right which i would say by the way to throw a lot of problem into this conversation would be to rediscover the notion of the sacred like what it means [2114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2114.72s)

to actually be able to treat with care the things that need to be held carefully um was a big part of the learning maybe that's another way of describing the notion of art you know to say that art is more like midwifery which means more like learning how to treat with care that which needs to be treated carefully [2132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2132.0s)

which is in the process of bringing itself into the world and you happen to be a steward or a custodian helping it come in tyson i was just thinking of what you said about uh that arguably bali might have been more [[game b]] historically and as you mentioned the continent now called australia that it might have been more [[game b]] previously and you having a a mindset a heart set a way of being or orientation that might be more [[game b]] from those roots that still has you uh a game a loser um i've never thought about it this way [2180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2180.079s)

before so this might not be right it's just a thought that's coming up in a moment is one way of maybe thinking about game a versus [[game b]] is that game a is defined at least largely by inexorability arguments that's the nature of the [[multipolar trap]] that's the nature of the [[arms race]] the tragedy of the commons and moloch and the need to keep up with competing ooda loops is uh our [[game b]] civilizations gonna get  killed by those guys and so we have to get better at warfare than them or die and if the spartans are putting all their [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2220.8s)

energy into warfare and we put any of our energy into arts we're gonna die right so you either have to beat the most successfully extractive and violent at extraction and violence or get beaten by them so what happens to art and culture and anything else and so there's a certain kind of inexorability argument in that right the i mean you take somebody as considerate as einstein and the einstein seller letter is what got the us to start the manhattan project because the inexorability of otherwise the germans are going to and and so but what's interesting is that inexorability arguments are fundamentally antithetical to the nature of choice like any kind of authenticity of freedom and one could say that maybe [[game b]] is something that is rooted in the reality of the nature of choice and that fundamentally seeks to protect and uphold it um and yet obviously uh [2283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2283.359s)

it still has to deal with inexorabilities and so this is something that we've talked about of how do you make something that doesn't lose at game a while not also converging to winning at gaming um because if it loses it gaming it's not [[game b]] it's just a cul-de-sac um but if it's way to not lose is to [2302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2302.88s)

just also be game a it's also a cul-de-sac and so the threading of the needle is something that and and so fundamentally what it's saying is that uh the inexorability is a fully causal thing because of x y must be otherwise y is overcome by x so what it's saying is a [2321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2321.599s)

way of working with the field of choice that is actually more effective than purely the domain of causation and then i would say as far as this conversation more effective and also more beautiful just just a thought that came up as you were describing that history yeah i think i was i was thinking it i [2347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2347.28s)

hadn't thought of bali as being um [[game b]] before but you know i guess if you you the way you were talking about the built environment sounds very [[game b]] it sounds like something that [[game b]] is um aspiring towards but yeah of course i'm aware of the um you know the the the [[game theory]] side of things and uh [2368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2368.64s)

that idea that the seed the seed of game a uh was there in uh ancient societies you know however um it wasn't a problem until things started to scale i think i've heard your story about the plow before being the um being the turning point for that as well um which is pretty cool yeah but um i don't know they had players [2391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2391.2s)

look we used to trade with them like for about a millennium ago you know we were trading with the mccassens so you know most of what i know about uh their pre-history is is through that trade and through the law that we have you know passed right right across around the continent you know about uh what those [2409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2409.839s)

people were like before and they were very different you know because they were mining they were doing all kinds of things like so that they brought steel uh here so we had uh things like machetes and anchors and stuff like that um you know uh for a few centuries before things changed here yeah yeah i'm gonna uh [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2432.88s)

speak to what daniel was talking about about this great conundrum and i'll call it the great conundrum and i will first be the first to admit we don't yet have the answer which is how do we build [[game b]] stay true to [[game b]] values not be co-op and at the same time uh not be crushed by game a uh you know this this is one of the many riddles that we have to solve uh and we have just the most rudimentary ideas on how to do it uh and i think it's gonna be one of the key parts of our work going forward uh the phrase i like to use is how can we build [[game b]] while simultaneously parasitizing game a which is to build membranes build bubbles of venus where people can actually live a true [2488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2488.319s)

and authentic game be life mostly uh while at the same time creating things of value uh to people over in game a and trading with them on terms that actually work for us uh and obviously you can think of the comp potential uh coordination issues you know what happens if uh [[game b]] membranes proto-b's sibiums uh start uh you know thinking that their status comes from how many uh shekels they stack up that they've pulled in from game a that's a failure mode right uh on the other hand if they don't pull in enough to keep themselves going uh and to defend themselves in legal and political and of necessary kinetic terms [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2535.359s)

then they also fail so this is going to be a very interesting and difficult balancing act and i think that uh these are highly high dimensional [[complex system|complex systems]] problems uh which we know are not actually tractable to analytical [2555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2555.839s)

solutions you can't actually do the math and say this is how [[game b]] parasitizes game a and remains true to itself so i think this is where art can essentially be a tuning mechanism as we start to confront these issues people will see artists people who know how to speak from the heart uh we'll start to see these uh conflicts and potential [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2578.4s)

compromises and we'll to through art uh put out things that remind us that uh that we have to be true and we have to somehow uh thread this needle and you know this is not the only such uh very difficult transition we're gonna have to go through to really bring a [[game b]] world into being and uh it sort of at least makes some sense to me [2602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2602.72s)

that our artists can be uh represent much bigger higher dimensional uh possible ways of thinking about these problems than can logic and syllogisms uh and we can and if we resonate with those and with some discernment amongst those it may help us collectively organize uh as we try to work out work [2625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2625.52s)

out these uh solutions to you know what seem from here to be uh really difficult problems i think um on the staying true side i think you got that's why you got your stoics in here it's the the thing i like about [[game b]] is i reckon it's the stoics that make it work um because you just can't [2652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2652.56s)

uh around them you know so i i you know i know there's a tendency in me to do that sense make a guru kind of thing where i can just kind of let myself off the hook i can go oh i've only got like 12 peer-reviewed publications most of those are co-authored um that's not because i'm a crappy [2671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2671.119s)

scholar that must be because i'm being persecuted for my for speaking the truth and you know the the system doesn't listen to me and and then i can like you know signal out to all these sort of disgruntled sort of people out there and get massive audiences and all that sort of thing you a lot of your sense maker gurus go that way but i find that um [2691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2691.28s)

you know [[game b]] is a really calm place where that doesn't happen and i think it's because of all the stoics and like your uh you know your actual first principle stuff going on tends to sober people up and i know that that sounds like infertile ground for um [2708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2708.56s)

arts but i think you need a calm place for arts you know as well and uh i think i think this kind of makes it we need a soundtrack by the way because i like uh turquoise sound she's here i like her for that she's starting to put together some interesting uh uh [[game b]] beats that i'm liking i hope she finishes that [2728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2728.319s)

album soon can you drop a link in the chat no not yet oh i did the wrong thing recently i sent i i like i sent a link to something that she was still working on and apparently that's a no-no in the musician community the wrong thing like that so we're gonna have to wait for it fair enough everything is good i hope she gets it [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2748.56s)

done soon because you need a soundtrack we need an anthem that's what we need well we also should figure out how to support turquoise sound in her work in the same way we were able to support jake and his work uh you know i think that one of the things that in this really early [[game b]] world we have to think about ways to [2770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2770.16s)

collectively collect resources uh to fertilize uh artistic expression and uh you know i look forward to uh turquoise's project showcase turquoise sounds project uh and other uh projects that i'm sure will be coming forth and figuring out how we as a community uh can support those people so they can make a living and they can contribute to the soundtrack and the [2794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2794.24s)

interior decorating and the uh uh you know the the dancing and and shaking of hands and the and and all that to really turn [[game b]] into into into a real thing and not just uh a bunch of logic so on this notion of uh the stoic and the relationship between the stoic and art um so one of the senses that i was having as i was trying to listen here is the the difference between dialectic and dialogues is the degree to which that there is a third or however many an n the center the whole is the one and everyone is listening to that and trying to find a way to speak for it right and one of the things that [2841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2841.68s)

the stoic does is it creates um a protective boundary for that space it actually creates a a spaciousness or a coolness or a quietness that allows the uh the whole to settle and then begin to be able to speak itself and um maybe that's what i with part of what you're sensing there tyson [2866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2866.72s)

yeah sorry but as i was just typing like a tapeworm you know tapeworm puts that substance out around it that sort of tricks the body into thinking it's not there um yeah and just kind of dials down the immune response around it yeah that that's i reckon the stoic stoics of that substance you know to follow on with jim's parasitic sort of metaphor which you know all good symbioses start out that way right i had a thought and tyson you're mentioning that uh i've talked about the plow as one of the turning points um and you're talking now about symbiosis emerging from parasitism [2916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2916.319s)

um i i wouldn't describe the agricultural revolution as the beginning of game a um it was a major step function in our ability to uh in a way you could say it was a major step function in the beginning of the anthropocene where we rather than hunter [2937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2937.44s)

gather where we wanted ecosystems we wanted to now start converting ecosystems to row crops and and our ability to extract calories from the world much faster than a natural environment grow populations faster surplus that whole kind of thing obviously we can look at the [[industrial revolution]] and oil as being a next major step function there were a few in there and then you know nuclear and digital and but i would take it back to stone tools and fire i take it to kind of the ability for the capacity for abstraction to increase our predatory capacity faster through tools and the environment could increase its [2980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=2980.96s)

resilience to our predatory capacity and there's just increasing early hominid anthropology coming out about how much our migration was not homo sapien migration was probably not just moving into empty spaces but killing all the neanderthals and earlier um non-sapient hominids in those places that that extinctionary tribal warfare was key to the actual niche that sapiens were moving into and that was both abstraction applied to language for coordination and and [[tool making]] i i might say that that was the beginning of [3020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3020.0s)

game a in a way and it's just a very long compounding curve and it has a couple step functions along the way um we because before that you could say there was rivalry but the rivalry had bounded cemeteries because nothing could increase its reverse capacity faster than the other things could increase [3038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3038.8s)

their response because mutation was pretty evenly distributed and co-selective pressures but you could even say well then evolution is has a lot of rivalries built in it's game a it just had bounded symmetries i would say like rivalry with unbounded cemeteries because of tech is really maybe the game a distinction and or one way i think about it and so then that creates these inexorability things right if the other guys are doing the the more powerful unbounded tech we have to or we lose because of the rivalry that was all the way back to pre-hu pre-human rivalrous selection criteria and but that thing that [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3083.359s)

inexorability on rivalry driving [[arms race|arms races]] on [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] only has shitty attractors right maybe some long-term stable dystopias and otherwise catastrophes unless we can figure out how to consciously direct that thing to something other than inexorability and this is now where art comes in centrally like what is the [[superstructure]] what are the ordinating values what is beautiful [3105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3105.359s)

that is worth and that is capable of binding that kind of a specifically tech power and very specifically [[exponential tech]] power so it's real interesting as we get further into this arts question like marvin harris following marx defined this pretty well with cultural [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3128.079s)

materialism that infrastructure drives [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]] but i would say all of the [[metacrisis]] is defined by that direction right the [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]] getting hollowed out by the inexorability on tech competition and i think the exact opposite is key for [[game b]] how do we actually refine [[superstructure]] deeply what are what is a good life what is beautiful what are the ordinating values to then have that reify of foreign by the people [[social structure|social structures]] that can bind and direct the infrastructure and that is fundamentally the domain of like arts and religion and spirituality so it's interesting as i think about it kind of all of my hope actually lives in our [3167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3167.76s)

ability to deepen that and have that be the basis for being able to build new [[social structure|social structures]] that both implement and bind the tech i i think in terms of tech i think there's some cultures in the world who jumped straight from flint napping to forging medals [3186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3186.8s)

they skipped steps in their apprenticeship you know so if you don't come from a culture that didn't have a few thousand years of ground edge ground edge stone tools then then you you missed something in your development this is i don't really believe this i'm just this is kind of a joke and a provocation [3206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3206.079s)

but um yeah so i mean on our continent here you know we had uh ground edge stone tools with thousands of years before anybody else so um and there's something you learn over deep time from ground edge tools if you've ever made a ground edge rather than i'm sure everybody's had a go at flint napping and [3224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3224.24s)

i don't know what you use deer antler or something like that over there napping the flint and that's fun but it's it's really immediate and quick you can make it in a few minutes you know whatever you need um but a ground ground edge tool it takes weeks months it can take a year you know to make it just right it takes a very long time and it's something you [3245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3245.359s)

put a lot of effort into and it's something you expect to last for a couple of generations it's something you hand down to your kids and your grandkids that ground edge tool um you know and i've made i've made a couple of axes and a couple of knives that way and it's taken years you know um that there is something you learn from that that's a kind of a more slow tech kind of way but yeah that i i i think you're right the seeds are always there because we have it in our stories here the stories are here warning again against those seeds of narcissism and everything in our law and everything in our tech is about um has always been about uh [3280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3280.72s)

holding those things in check and preventing multiple traps from happening it's as soon as i learned that concept of multiple trap from you i think was the first time i ever heard it um you know i was looking back through all our old stories and and it's like that's all i could see was people kicking off [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and then getting smashed for it um you [3302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3302.319s)

know and being punished and that being stopped there yeah um very cool anyway i'm just teasing you about the the flint napping you you you your flint tools are great they're lovely i was noticing um um in this notion [3322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3322.16s)

in the notion of a shift and maybe that's exactly right a shift into a uh kind of a different mode of expression and at least an upregulation of this notion of art one of the things that was coming up for me was how important it is that it not be in the intent of translation [3338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3338.799s)

right so this this isn't an effort it would be it'd be wrong i'll just say it cleanly would be wrong for the ones who are coming to with with art as a capacity to imagine what they are doing is trying to take what daniel said and express it in as in artistically it's the wrong move [3359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3359.04s)

there's a different move a right move which is that there's a thing that just is and the artist's job is to express it directly and to learn how to become capable of expressing it and to the degree to which the words and the drawings that have been produced [3375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3375.68s)

allow a way of tuning to the thing yeah to be able to notice that we're we're in the same place and then the expression has a consonants with the words there's a correspondence or a harmony or more specifically a coherence but isn't even vaguely trying to use the words to direct it then it's well it goes beyond and that's the point because this next stage is actually going beyond anything that's come so far so it's not a i think it's it's definitely not marketing right it's not a trying way to express to a broader audience something that has been expressed so far in words or even to try to capture the ideas and polish them but [3413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3413.44s)

rather a unique form of expression of something that is calling for this mode and that's that's the way i would um urgent if there's a desire on the part of the artists to begin to play yeah you know actually never say the thing and that's i i guess i guess you could argue that the [[game b]] uh initiation video is is not art um because it says that it's the thing it's it's it's it's uh instructional is this this discrete sort of you know this knowledge is directly sort of uh given there and information um but i tell you i was talking to you heard of that fine horn community yeah in scotland i was talking to them and and they were telling me about a problem they had with an arsonist there so they got an intentional community but there was an arsonist in the community at some stage they had no way of dealing with that now just telling that story you know of of a woman watching her house burning and trying to figure out [3475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3475.92s)

how the hell she's going to deal with that in an intentional community where they've got their own law it's like uh just telling that story that would be a [[game b]] piece of eye you don't mention [[game b]] at all you don't mention um you know the the game a bloody you know freeloaders and all that kind of thing yeah [3497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3497.04s)

i have a thought on [[game b]] art and a [[game b]] art project that is somewhere between art and design there's certainly a uh rational and consequentialist consideration but it is there's also simply a feeling and maybe this would be the intersection of those um uh i was talking to brk ingles about a project that he's working on that is uh putting together a model for the technosphere of the world that would work to solve the kind of limits of growth problem and it's not trying to do the enactment of how do we actually get there but with current tech what would a [3546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3546.799s)

what would the energy system waste management agriculture manufacturing production city design transportation if if we could rebuild the world from scratch today how would we build it that solved those things um just to basically be able to explore the limits of what is doable and desirable with current tech and have us kind of rethink it that's an [3565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3565.52s)

interesting project um i think there's an art project would be super interesting to me from this point of view of like environmental psych ontologic design and environmental psych the broken windows theorem just changing like it's interesting because you you cover over the [3585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3585.68s)

graffiti and you fix the windows and you pick up the trash in an area and crime drops fifty percent right like simply and you can say that's because it's signaling there's law here and people care about it it's also that it's a more beautiful place so people intrinsically care about it but the idea that like how criminal people are or the nature of their [3604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3604.079s)

psyches what's going on inside of them and their behavior changes so much by their environment and then how a cathedral is designed or mosque is designed to evoke experiences in the people inside and if we think about if you could apply cathedral design to the entire technosphere um not just how do we make a technosphere that works well with the biosphere but how do we make a technosphere that works with the social sphere to enlighten the people inside of it as the kind of design consideration and have people who are thinking from an environmental psych point of view and from an artistic point of view so it's what is the most beautiful world but not [3640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3640.319s)

just limited to a particular lens on aesthetics but factoring the environmental psych of what is a world that evokes the most beauty in the people and if we were to just say if we got to kind of rebuild the world from scratch we got to redesign it re-art it how would we do it what would it look like if you factored that the entire [3660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3660.319s)

experience of the behaviors that elicited and how it interacted with all the senses was maximally developmentally enlightening for the people in it i would just love to see people working on that project yeah that's what's going to be one of the fun things about the proto-b movement as we actually start to build communities on the ground [3684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3684.799s)

membranes that are b ish but uh communicate with each other and with uh uh game a is that i would expect each proto-b to develop its own aesthetic right uh to essentially find its way towards mutual resonance between the people who live there [3705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3705.92s)

uh and uh and the build-out of the property how much of the land goes for agriculture versus beautiful gardens and nature how much for grazing versus field crops trees versus shrubs efficient quote-unquote rectilinear buildings versus less efficient but perhaps more [3728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3728.72s)

beautiful uh you know no no sharp corners kinds of buildings etc and then at the next level up you know let's say we have a thousand proto-b's scattered around in uh 50 years 30 years 25 years 25 years uh and someone comes of age right so a b grows it up and you know they you know like a lot of 17 [3752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3752.88s)

year olds they look around and they go damn this is some stuffy old you know this is stuff mom and and dad designed right yeah so one could imagine them going on a on a heart journey and visiting many proto-bees right and one of the things that they could be doing is tuning their aesthetics does the [3773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3773.92s)

aesthetics of this proto-b that i'm visiting for two weeks resonate with me bring me life bring me joy make me a bigger person than i was when i got here and then springer yeah rum spring i guess absolutely but though yeah and when they find the one that is aesthetically correct for them that may be a big part [3795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3795.2s)

of the halt of their journey uh and so this way uh proto-b's by the thousands and tens of thousands are essentially a series of experiments and how does aesthetics and ways of living uh resonate with the people that live within them uh and there is no right answer i would expect them to be rather different of course they'll be horizontal [3819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3819.76s)

communications where tricks of the trade uh that are figured out in one place like you know how do we build a package sewage treatment plant that produces high quality compost right uh you know it'd be great to share those techniques when somebody figures it out but when it comes to aesthetics and what songs what kind of dance uh you know what what is the schedule of [3839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3839.68s)

our rituals uh those probably differ considerably at each one and that's a good thing right so what i've come to call coherent pluralism is that we have some deep uh small kernel of coherence uh that we all agree to but in terms of the build out of our of our lived experience uh we design it locally and and resonantly between the people and the ideas and we should not expect them [3866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3866.96s)

to be the same you know how i know [[game b]] is working jim is that um none of these participants here hundreds of people none of them are listening to us right now it's all going off in the chat that's where it's all happening they're not even listening to us they've got their own things going on [3883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3883.92s)

in there that's how i know it's working and that's how i know it's good oh well it's getting even better when we're just completely silent and they're not listening to us then it'll be absolutely perfect let's see if people are listening so let there be light in the the stoa we'll pivot to some questions and uh we'll go with amy first our resident art critic here at the stoa amy if you could unmute yourself hello um so i really enjoyed the film um for me as a person that's kind of ensconced in art and aesthetics i kind of look beyond just kind of the uh music the visuals and you know the script and that sort of thing to like the underlying what is being communicated and i mean to me there's a fear-based mentality that kind of defines gay me dynamics for me um scarcity that kind of thing so to me when you have a character like [3949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3949.039s)

the pioneer um whose voice is so anxious throughout the whole film and and i'm not i'm again i'm not like i'm not trying to dis uh jake's film i think it was very well done um i'm wondering if that's overly aligning with game a aesthetics and if [[game b]] artistic production needs to find a different kind of aesthetic language that is not kind of [3975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=3975.2s)

aligning with fear with anxiety with competitiveness and etc etc i i don't know if that question exactly makes sense and i think i mean this is kind of what daniel was talking about with the idea of not just you know not just you know kind of creating visuals but actually embodying a new kind of um mentality but i just wanted to make that point and see if you all had any thoughts on it truthfully i'd like to hear jake react to that one oh gosh oh thanks jim um i don't that doesn't i don't i don't know maybe i don't understand the question so much but it feel it doesn't [4032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4032.319s)

feel whole to me to to think about a [[game b]] as not aligning with that kind of energy um it's funny actually the this i submitted this script to jim the first time and he was truly shocked and baffled and and and [4053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4053.359s)

then he said he said give it another round just see what you you can do with it and and i said well how about i just write a completely separate film a completely different idea and it was it was very pathetic it was it was the opposite it was it had [4072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4072.0s)

uh some extreme kind of existential horror in it um but to me that's you know that that's got to be part of gaming too right i mean when i said in the beginning this is a pro uh protopian vision you know it includes it includes the shittiness [4091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4091.68s)

of life right um so yeah yeah i'd also like to add that i think a key consideration as remember we we are at the very tiny first baby steps of [[game b]] hood here we are tiny game a is huge and powerful and all of us are completely saturated in what we've called game a malware right there's all kinds of up shits in our [4117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4117.359s)

heads and you know at least for me uh when i uh watch the film uh the pioneer's journey is uh you know a whole lot about her kind of going you know going back and forth between the possibility of game a and having all i mean possibility of [[game b]] and having all this game a malware in her head represented by the parasite and so uh you know this kind of ugliness uh strikes struck me at least uh as appropriate for a person who's just stepping out of the big and strong game a into the tiny weak little [[game b]] any of the other uh panelists have any thoughts to share on that question i was writing something in the chat so i [4180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4180.88s)

didn't hear the question jeff you had your hand up yeah i mean um i think there's a a lot that we have to think about in terms of conveying these ideas um and and the the way to do that is a little bit different from the conventional way that we've been uh [4200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4200.719s)

telling stories and expressing some of our our artwork um i've been talking with jordan and some of the others here uh in the room about new modalities of storytelling you know instead of the the drama of conflict can there be a a drama of reconciliation the excitement of attempting systemic [4228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4228.239s)

change rather than uh wiping out the bad guy you know the engagement that can be accomplished with participative narrative we have technology that allows for um you know dozens or hundreds or or tens of thousands of people to contribute to the story even to be credited for their contribution through [4252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4252.88s)

things like [[blockchain]] that's really exciting it affords us new opportunities to convey some of the um elements of the of the [[game b]] narrative um it's really exciting to me um in the past guys and i know this is a little trojan horsey [4274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4274.8s)

uh but uh some of the uh some pieces of popular entertainment are responsible really for changing attitudes and conversations about things like race and gender all in the family there was a a soap opera that came from south america about a maid who was oppressed and who figured out how to educate herself through night school [4301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4301.28s)

and millions of of women across south america in the late 1960s started to go to night school you know willing grace uh started the conversation in the popular sensibility about being gay um uh we can do this with uh with [[game b]] uh uh narratives and [[game b]] uh components i'm pledged to i'm gonna tell you right here i just sold something to the walt disney company and it is going to be shot through with [[game b]] you know and i'm going to trojan horse that thing right through the mouse's ass so um you know let's all uh try and do that if that's our our inclination there [4347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4347.679s)

can be some malcolm x's in the room but a few trojan horse threw the mouse's ass this is how like the language is created korean culture right here there you go best meme ever a graduate student of the future who's unraveling how [[game b]] ended up being the world operating system that'll turn out to be the pivotal moment in their dissertation did you have any follow-up share no i i but i think um jeff that you are correct that i think that they're that even the most pop cultural kind of um you know sitcoms and tv shows have the possibility to change culture i would [4396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4396.48s)

just um love to see artistic product that was less aligned with game a um personality and dynamics just because i don't find them interesting personally um but thank you so much agreed look um just did something come up about violence there i think there needs to be violence i i don't think it's a good [4419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4419.199s)

idea to uh completely remove violence from your from your proto-b because um it ends up bubbling up that's how you end up that's what i told the fine horn people it's like like i asked them do you have any any combat rituals do you have like you know do you all get out the front and punch on for a bit every now and then let off some steam [4437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4437.04s)

you know do you have any violent games do you play like to to work out all those problems do you have combat do you have anything like they said no i don't know we eschew violence completely and i'll say well that's why every now and then you know one of you goes nuts and starts burning everyone's houses down you need to uh humans need that outlet you gotta [4454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4454.64s)

let off some steam you gotta punch on every now and then amy so uh yeah that that came that came up there i really need a little bit of violence it's gotta be uh factored in the people who are defending and protecting game [4471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4471.76s)

a are going to fight you know so there's going to be violence there's going to be confrontation is the reason why we would fight that's the sort of the curious thing about the whole is that it contains everything yeah people asked the question earlier [4494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4494.32s)

earlier about things like logic and his logic part of this [[game b]] violence of course the answer is yes the question is can you use it as a medium of art are you actually coming from the place the place that is the thing from which art comes and then you use the medium as a medium to express if you are then you're doing it and if you're not then even if you're playing music or dancing you're not doing it you're doing propaganda or marketing right so it's it's the connectivity the continuity the being part of the whole in service to the whole to bring more wholeness [4534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4534.64s)

in each step in every breath and so to live artfully is art is to be an artist and that is in everything every moment and every breath and every express and of course in every silence tyson i'm really glad that you brought up the uh maybe if finnorn had a problem because of not having violence um and i'm thinking of art [4560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4560.08s)

uh i i grew up watching star trek the next generation when i was a kid and i think as far as art that is visioning a like that's doing sci-fi that isn't dystopic um it was maybe one of the high water marks in pop culture and the fact that they had a wharf character [4580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4580.8s)

and he needed to go to the holodeck and fight i thought was a really important thing because you have the data character you have the deanna troy character you have like they they were kind of elements of the self being archetypally represented or that's how i took it and uh you needed warf's character right and but you also needed a holodeck where they could go to war games otherwise it would re-emerge um there needs to be a place to experience oh yeah the [[multipolar trap]] actually sucks we don't want to do that thing oh we have to understand this phenomena otherwise you never get away from cultural decay [4618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4618.64s)

that in a few generations the same repeats again because you lost the lessons of the guys who figured out how to deal with the violence that emerged and so you you're stuck in patterns of like four generation or however many generation decay cycles then violence again if you don't stay connected to the lessons that were learned through [4636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4636.96s)

violence and um and so then you know jordan said it's all still there i would then say fear too right they all the things that evolved have an evolutionary purpose and this is if anything one of the things i noticed about the film and i don't think it did this wrong because we just have to do this a million ways is in the very beginning it seems like you've been playing game a do you want to play [[game b]] i think even thinking about game a to [[game b]] is a fairly binary thing ends up being problematic that doesn't mean it's not useful or instructive to begin with but when i think about defining it i'm like is do we get rid of [[conflict theory]] no do we get rid of the evolutionary basis of fear no do do i want to hold that as a value that drives it into everyone's shadow so it just unconsciously hijacks them like an arson inside the way that it happens in a culture though um do we get rid of violence no [4694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4694.08s)

okay well if we're still gonna have [[conflict theory]] and we can see that there's a way in which even game a you can say has been like stephen pinker's not totally wrong right the the book positive sum is not totally wrong things have moved towards more [[collective intelligence]] and more cooperation in many ways um so in the face of how powerful the effects of our rivalry through warfare and how much our externalities can be we're moving into a phase where we the phase where we just have to deal with externalities and rivalry more than we ever did and so [[game b]] to me is kind of a threshold dynamic on those um yeah so as i spent a little bit more time with some zen buddhists i discovered that the the notion of pissing people off isn't necessarily a bad thing so i i also noticed that i pissed a lot of people off when i told them that the nomenclature of gaming and b was intended to be a cohen [4759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4759.76s)

so if you hear game a [[game b]] and you hear a distinction you're here with game a ears when you've landed in [[game b]] ears you don't hear it as a dichotomy it's a cohen that probably just pissed you off and so it probably landed right i think it's like a rhyme scheme for a poem the abab yeah there you go we're gonna get some game a b a b a b poems happening so we're approaching the top of the hour and it might be good to have uh just like a go around the panel to close and maybe i'll uh ask a question or prompt [4810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4810.8s)

and i was like trying to hold back my uh my giggles my stoic giggles as being the token stoic here at the start when when you guys were talking about stoicism as pierre hadeau he he considered the stoics what they call the stokes as artists of life not artists of reason as modern philosophers and the idea is viewing life itself as a [4829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4829.12s)

artwork and by trying to like earnestly adopt that it's just i see everything as art like making my bed to hosting a zoom room so i guess the question to close out is how are each one of you um making your light more life more artful uh i'll start i'll take that one on first as not that much of a creative artist myself in fact not at all i suppose the degree that i'm trying to make my art my life artful is intentionally living far away from big cities on a you farm growing our own food cooking our own [4873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4873.52s)

food hanging out with regular people and that sort of stuff it just feels so much more real than the life uh used to live as uh you know deeply embedded in the matrix of game a so just physically getting away from all that stuff is in its own way a way of living more artfully i just said in the chat that the way you [4904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4904.0s)

curate yarns on your podcast is art thanks jordan you're muted and just pointing out jim's f-bombs or a particular you know he's a master of the medium but my um i suppose whether i like it or not my approach has been to endeavor to sort of i i imagine that [4931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4931.92s)

everyone here has noticed that the world has continued to be even more of a show than it normally has been and it seems to just continue to press on that and uh the approach that i've taken is to try to continue to metabolize it and to continue to try to drink as much of it in as i can and then to try to find a way to allow [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4952.8s)

that to continue to become part of me and then continue to show up in life in spite of that which is always very close to not quite um and yet every morning there's a waking up and continuing so that's the way that i've been living our life artfully daniel or tyson do you want to [4979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=4979.76s)

close with a share uh sure just a very simple thing not uh not very philosophically interesting but um i've been writing more poetry again lately which is something that i go through phases with and really love and it is very different than writing logical prose um in terms of [5000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5000.96s)

uh both the feeling and states that it elicits in me and also even the types of insights so that's fun just a thought there's no word for art or music in my language and doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's never been done [5028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5028.4s)

it's it's it's interesting the kind of art you do and the kind of music you do when you don't have words for those things it's very unself-conscious um when it's not a thing when it's a when it's a process yeah but see that's getting into linguistic relativism there which is uh [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5045.76s)

a whole another whole another stowaway episode all right so i'll make some uh closing announcements in a moment but uh jim jordan tyson daniel thank you so much for coming today to the stoa to be on this panel and uh jake and jeff thank you for uh producing and creating uh this uh premiere um so here at the stove for 2022 we're trying to make art uh and [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5071.76s)

we have um experimental art uh with sessions and we have a few coming up this week one called the embodiment hour with skyler brown schuyler would you like to unmute yourself and share what that that's going to be um hi everyone this was really really fun thank you so much for for this yeah so the embodiment hour is um we take a piece of culture um anything from a tweet to a piece of a film um piece of art would be great maybe this week to stay with the theme um and then or an essay or article like a consilience article and we [5113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5113.44s)

um take it in together as a group and then notice what's going on for us in an embodied sense so we look at the feelings the sensations the emotions that are arising and then we share um and make sense of the experience at that embodied level together it's really fun yeah we watched a clip of don't look up last time and it was like really a lot [5139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5139.84s)

of constriction in the body uh and then the other session we have is called social alchemy turning socially awkward situations to social art and aj bond and i it's kind of like mba schools you know they have case studies for business cases we take social awkward situations that someone brings forth and we try to transmute it into art and then the session itself attempts [5158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5158.159s)

to be art because as the stoips say don't explain your philosophy embody it you can check that out at the stoa.ca and benito roy uh and john viveki will be in conversations on a session called the ecologies of the south which is the first time they're in conversation so that's gonna be quite epic uh so that being said uh everyone thank you so much for coming to the store today [5178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKz9TAsqsRo&t=5178.159s)

and thank you peter again for pulling this together
