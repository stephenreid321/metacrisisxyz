[[music]] the cognitive complexity of issues that the world faces is more than a single person can process single brain that can't actually hold that cognitive complexity so it requires [[collective intelligence]] and collective sense we're probably not going to solve the complex we give existential problems we face with individual horsepower of thing rivalries games we're probably going to need to get together and be able to create a higher form of [[collective intelligence]] and [[sensemaking]] now what and how so the answer now what is decentralize [[collective intelligence]] great how how do we do that [[music]] honest i'm kind of interesting hearing your narrative on why sense-making is important why this question and i'm not [54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=54.51s)

actually gonna name the question yet whatever the question is why it is not just important but central what i think the strange attractor that draws us all here together is sense-making it's about the exploration into what is real and what is meaningful is bound to what's real and we find that we have the at least have the experience of having choice and we're trying to find out how [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=86.64s)

to orient our choice and so since making to inform choice making is what is what is reality what is my relationship with reality what is fundamentally meaningful as a basis for how i can make choices that are more aligned with what i find meaningful yeah my think mine's probably many layers of abstraction below these framings although a totally you know [126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=126.74s)

track and appreciate what you guys are also saying my basic gut senses hey back to complicated versus complex we're probably not going to solve the complex we could existential problems we face with individual horsepower playing rivalries games we're probably going to need to get together and be able to create a higher form of [[collective intelligence]] and [[sensemaking]] and what i've been seeing lately paying attention to this space is it's starting to bubble up but it feels like a wildly unstable element and it's breaking my heart / freaking me out it's not concerning me that we our efforts to create group coherent seem to be going so badly so far and so i'm deeply committed to figuring out what are the rate limiters / achilles heels [183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=183.53s)

missing links that can help us at least stop you know failing forward making you better different mistakes because it feels like our efforts right now are actually just the last half century red ducks with very little go forward learning happening so it feels like transformational culture is basically just repeating the baby boomer hippie new-age traps and just running into the [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=212.62s)

running off the roads at exactly all the same places there's already the skid marks and so talking with you guys i find incredibly valuable on what are the big systemic issues what are other ways to think of this and how do we help give more people in your terms the [[generator function|generator functions]] to keep figuring this up together and make newer better more suspect [242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=242.36s)

there is just not the same hole i heard ridiculous i mean my my patter i think is the in fact it may be identical but my experience of it of the way i would even describe is very first person which is that my path here is through a very very large number of distinct personal failures like just running into a wall and going okay well that's wrong turning a little bit bring into another wall [268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=268.0s)

that's wrong turning a little bit right into another wall ik the number of times that i have  __  up is insane like i came in like thousands if not tens of thousands it's crazy and in the process of that for example this is a good case study one of the things they ended up getting a hold it was the notion that you could actually do things when you could imagine what the consequences of [290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=290.95s)

your actions might be quite a distance down the road and you could actually really really good at that to the point you could actually sit there and hear someone to describe a plan to you and you could listen to the plan and go that won't work right and be very confident that in fact that plan is not a good plan i mean an example might be i'm going to walk up to the fireplace and [311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=311.02s)

point my hands i didn't say light i'll say well you know that's not gonna work i've got a good model of how reality works i've done this sort of thing before bad plan alright so what i found though was that as i absorb more and more life experience and more and more knowledge i began to be noticed that more and more often more and more people's plans were of that sort [330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=330.04s)

and that was like well that's interesting so i took that as an object of inquiry and by the way again my own being first and foremost so okay  __  long-term planning is not working out so i got you know kept going okay how can you actually make effective choices how can you actually plan at all about what's gonna happen in the future and what i began to notice was the stuff [351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=351.43s)

we've been talking about like everything that we currently believe that we can plan won't work like none of the stuff that we have in our tool kit that allows us to make plans for the future is gonna work out fill in the blank like pick any problem i kept running the situations when people describe a particular problem everything we're gonna solve climate we're gonna solve conflict we're [373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=373.0s)

gonna solve education just listen to them talk about their plan and go well that's not gonna work only is that not gonna work it's gonna work like terribly what's happening so this led me to then finally looking at it okay what might and then that began the process of saying okay how do we actually get to the point we can begin to get some level of clarity on what [392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=392.63s)

might actually be a meaningful step and that leads me here that this is the answer to that question the answer of recognizing that the question of [[sensemaking]] together is ultimately a question of how do i make better choices and how do i and you become a we who make better choices hopefully in some context that builds to us collectively actually being able to make the kinds of better choices [429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=429.14s)

that are truly responsive to the environment we find ourselves in like it's just sort of the first step of that cycle [[music]] the way i've been describing it is i do it in a historical narrative which is to say that there was a method of human beings coming together into a group that had certain adaptive capacities that i'm [451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=451.479s)

gonna call the the dunbar coherence and this is what we've talked about it's like that thing that happened somewhere around the paleolithic transition the upper paleolithic transition where humans suddenly kicked into something that was kind of a new thing culture the human animal began to kick ass i'm gonna call that the dunbar coherence and that was really effective and that blew all [479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=479.759s)

over the world humanity covered the whole globe filled every niche became the people in every niche until somewhere in the range of 35,000 ish years ago it started running into itself it was able to out-compete every other organism on the planet until it ran into itself and so when humans from the dim bar coherence ran into other humans were in the dunbar coherence and they were so [504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=504.13s)

successful that their population began rising beyond the carrying capacity the environment that they're in ie they entered into self created conditions of real scarcity then they had to start competing with each other and this led to a next wave of evolutionary exploration for trying to find something that was a more effective way for human beings to come together and work [527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=527.32s)

together than the dunbar coherence that's game a game a is a solution to the problem of how do you get people to be able to work together effectively as a group at scale and so dunbar what the limitation of the dunbar coherence was that it couldn't scale past 150 people so a rock harare posits basically he reduces it all massively and says it's our ability to gossip i don't think [551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=551.709s)

that's that reductio was really bad in my perspective it's a lot of stuff like our ability to embody models of other people's states and the state of all the complementary relationships they have there's an example like there's a lot of stuff going on many of it game a this is all right how do i solved the problem of scale while maintaining the benefits of people [573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=573.63s)

working together and this is the three problems how do i actually create something where the group is effectively able to actually support itself in the context of nature how do i create a condition where it doesn't eat itself from the inside how do i avoid corruption infection and things like that and how do i actually create enough power inside that that group that it can [592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=592.59s)

actually compete now with other groups now of course we had the whole story of game a playing out over time the solution the game a comes up with is this entire store there's society mind paradigms so think of it as like a most computational actuation that simplifies human relationships and puts them in very simple relationships to have inputs and outputs formal structures money law [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=613.98s)

anything that can fit in a semantic narrative the actually have been really held by a person in teaching if you've written down in a book and repeat it over and over again it's simplified there's a lot to it but i want to mean we don't have forever so then we fast forward it's okay game a has a whole bunch of things inside as possibility space so it can we deliver on the ming [632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=632.43s)

dynasty and rome and the prussians and 21st century us sorry these are all inside the thing the game they can be but they're all variations on that theme we come to where we are now the problems that we're facing or a different set of problems right and the problems we run into now is that game a in and of itself can't ultimately deal with complexity both complexity in terms of actually [657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=657.75s)

being able to take full closed-loop responsibility for the for the national environment every instantiation of game a that has ever shown up has always ultimately depleted the resources of the environment that is sitting on top of to a level of collapse of some sort couldn't feed enough people either produced you too many people or depleted the resources it can't deal with [676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=676.8s)

complexity on the inside meaning that it always goes through some kind of group selection on the interior corruption defection dynamic that leads to fragility that causes it to collapse on the outside and then the third is the thing that we talked about which is that precisely because it is so effective at power on an underlying premise of win-lose dynamics [698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=698.97s)

was invented for the purpose of competing with other people in the context of scarcity as it actually has become extremely powerful this is the problem becoming godlike at the level of power but not at the level of wisdom right so a game a runs to the limits of its of its boundary conditions it can't solve those three fundamental problems in evin of itself so something new has [718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=718.03s)

to be developed so it's okay well that's [[game b]] just literally we're just defining a place it's a pointer to something over here so like a wool what is that the first thing is the reason why we can name it [[game b]] is to say what's something that is in fact a different game altogether all right so go over to the basis it's something on the order of magnitude of the difference [737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=737.92s)

between the band level nomadic dunbar 150 human level and every single thing that has happened in civilization since then that whole box is different right that order of magnitude and it has characteristics that allow it to actually actually address these three questions and their complexity natural complexity and the problematic of [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] that comes from learning it's okay what does that look like what are some characteristics of that and that's some of the things we've been talking about today at the center of it for me at least as i've gone through the questioning of this over and over and over again it recognized for example that you have to change the mind otherwise you just recapitulate this [782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=782.56s)

society is this thing we've been calling coherent [[collective intelligence]] and coherence specifically is that the very center of it but in many ways game be even talked about has a bit of that taoist sense to it as you're naming it in the context of game a quite often you're actually importing gaming into it so you have to actually treat it very very carefully it's less about being [808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=808.06s)

able to describe it than it is in fact just being able to do it it is the kind of thing that you do not the kind of thing you talk about you can talk about how you can become capable of it but designing it talking about it is generally a full fundamental error that does that make sense what i'm saying there i mean i think just depends on how [828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=828.52s)

taoist we imagine [[game b]] to be well that's very odd because you can't actually be taoist interesting enough but it can actually be it's more like the taoist insight that points to the dao i can say very clearly if i could articulate it my definition is complicated it's not complicated [[game b]] is not complicated [[game b]] must be intrinsically complex so i cannot define [853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=853.57s)

it in any finite set of statements because any finite set of statements it's complicated so it's not that kind of thing so if i'm explaining as i'm describing it i have to be doing it in something which is essentially poetic not a specification or where as daniel said i'm pointing towards the [[generator function|generator functions]] they give rise to something that is more than the thing that is said [878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=878.29s)

noticing three distinct things to come up one is the question of why why did this thing which i'll just call coherence that we've been talking about the the second is why does it thus far fail to scale and then of course the third is how might we do about solving that problem all three seem to be showing up close to each other in my sense do you want to share more what you [921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=921.52s)

mean by coherence all right immediately what comes up so what is this thing and there's a lot of different ways of talking about it but we might say there's ah actually interesting it seems like you actually have to talk about it in many different ways because it is the kind of thing that cannot be conveyed effectively in language you know it's the matrix unfortunately no one can be [950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=950.83s)

told what coherence is but we can't actually tell a lot of different stories it's become the blonde with the elephant and after a little while we might be able to in ourselves grass perhaps what is being pointed out so one way of describing it is it is a it's a form of [[collective intelligence]] that has as a characteristic a high degree of capacity in the space of novelty and a [987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=987.389s)

intrinsic antifragility in both human and throw powe complexity and nature complexity another way of saying that is if you work backwards in taking a look at all the different challenges and problems that we are currently facing we meaning humanity is the answer to the set that contains those problems another way of describing it is it's something like flow since we have that as a nice [1035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1035.76s)

concrete frame then we can invoke that in an unconstrained way ie we oftentimes associate with flow with flow in a domain a rock-climber isn't flowing climbing rocks a jazz band isn't flow and playing jazz coherence is flow absent context absent a particular application you know so mentioned he said it has a relationship with novelty what prompts you to put [1072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1072.919s)

that into the mix because if i just hear the word coherent so that just feels let you know from physics electronics whatever it would just be things in some form of sync with each other but you added in novelty and antifragility the brothers have seemed interesting but they're not what i would have just expected to come from the word so can you help unpack either the y or the how [1099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1099.14s)

you got to those yeah i think also to begin it's i think what you bring up is good we should just say that there's different kinds of [[collective intelligence]] and some kinds of [[collective intelligence]] we have different names for with my call them different things so in this context we're going to have to be very familiar with the notion that word choice is [1127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1127.25s)

oftentimes going to require some careful definition as you just did so let's just for everyone who's listening just recognize that oftentimes i have a certain vocabulary daniel has vocabulary you have a vocabulary we're all operating under what i've called rule omega which is listen to what is being expressed not what is being said and asked good questions until what is being [1148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1148.48s)

expressed has actually felt it's landed so if we think about the examples of flow you've provided so well one of the things that shows up so commonly is a sense of there being an emergence or a synergy where there's something about a hole that is greater than the sum of the parts and that as it turns out happens to be the best way to respond to novelty let me add some words that i think might [1181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1181.15s)

add clarity to a question i hear you asking we've discussed offline some different types of coherence in different contexts and like formal models for looking at what coherence in different contexts means and so when you mention like physics like things of the same type like pendulums or lasers that's a coherence of sameness they all become [1207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1207.93s)

the same wavelength they have the same periodicity and when we're talking about humans being able to come into coherence we're not wanting a homogenizing coherence and if you think about something like a body liver cells and neurons and fat cells are all very different types of cells and yet they're operating in a way where the body is an [[emergent property]] that has capacities that none of the cells or organs or subsystems they can separately have so it's a coherence of different things where the difference is the basis of synergy rather than being the basis of an unreconciled or conflict the difference is a basis for synergy where each of them have capacity separately and then the whole has capacities neither of them have that are found in [1259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1259.15s)

each of them plus the relationships as opposed to the differences being a basis for unreconciled will conflict so we're interested here in the types of coherence that can occur where there are differences right differences of experience differences of perspective and yet like so i'll just tie a couple other words together jordan said he said it's kind of like flow if we think of [1286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1286.45s)

flow from fluid dynamics in terms of like laminar flow versus turbulent flow there's a more flow is less entropy and actually not just less entropy buts entropy the movement towards holes that have greater than some of the parts and so i think that's what we're really interested in collective [[sensemaking]] is how do we come together in relationship that has less friction less entropy [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1310.51s)

relationally moore's entropy where the group of us has capacities has [[emergent property|emergent properties]] that aren't found in any of us in isolation the coherence is that phenomena that [[emergent property|emergent properties]] arise from right and then so the the other distinction was we've got we've got examples of this kind that have no we're actually gonna get pretty nuanced so we may as well just be careful about the [1341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1341.95s)

were getting nuanced we have a particular kind of coherence i'm just gonna label coordination just we have a label for it and this has a lot of weird angels talking about in fact it has [[emergent property|emergent properties]] so for example if you've got a mathematician having a conversation with an economist there's in fact a hole in their conversation that is greater than the sum of the parts there's there's a connection between those two ways of thinking the toolkits of mathematics that's not available as the economist unlocks things the economist wouldn't have known about but for example the economists questions that weren't things the mathematician was thinking about unlocks things the mathematician wasn't thinking about right so there's a synergy value [1383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1383.169s)

to that that's also not the thing we're talking about that's awesome really good useful but for very specific reasons which we can go to if we'd like it doesn't actually have the capacity to to satisfy the requirements of call it the problems that we're facing kant said if i just satisfy the problems of nature natural complexity it can't satisfy the problems event ropo complexity one of [1412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1412.39s)

which is why it keeps breaking down every time you try to build something like this an trope of complexity often times it becomes the primary reason why it breaks down yeah i mean it seems like if i'm hearing right the question is just how how can we get together with each other in a way that leaves us smarter kind of more creative more courageous more resilient [1438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1438.9s)

than any of us are a part and me at least as far as terms for me flow is often a bit of a buzzword and i think a lot of people project onto it but some slightly more precise like if i'm thinking of examples and you can tell me if i'm barking up the right tree or not but like examples i think of is victor turner's notion at university of chicago community toss which is a it's not [1467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1467.639s)

simply a collection it's not just a crowd or a mom it's a felt presence of coherence among a group and then you think about like quakers use the term a gathered meeting there's a regular meeting we all shuffle into the meeting house no one says much and and people or even people may say a few things and that can not be a gathered meeting that's just a physical collection of [1490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1490.859s)

humans on a sunday morning but a gathered meeting is there you know over centuries of really delicate listening into that is that place where you're speaking only when spoken through and that the [[collective intelligence]] is given voice through a given individual but it's clearly not just their thoughts ideas or words does that try yes for you guys okay [1518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1518.429s)

now i know obviously analogies of humans and brains and minds to computers are obviously problematic and a whole bunch of different levels but as far as a simple one does this also seem to be the notion of connecting cpus or computers in serial such that the connected computational power and capacity is greater than any of the things in between and that they might actually [1541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1541.559s)

even be able to tackle problems that in any individual computer would be uncapable of solving actually no and that goes back to the in addition of coordination so that style of connection is coordination and it does have the characteristic of increasing capacity and in fact increasing capacity in a fashion that is well at least depending on the specific [1569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1569.39s)

kind of problem and the physical capacity to do compute often times it better to polish if you're solving particular kinds of problems that make sense so much of sin it doesn't i'm just winning is there a magic in the supercomputer is there a like for instance if all i can do is let's go back 20 years you know and if all i could do is do email and aol you know [1590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1590.43s)

but if we connected up enough of them together we can actually project a hologram and actually you know model something totally new and different but none of those things couldn't do i mean if it's if it's a problematic metaphor we can abandoned i'm just thinking no it's a big it's a very good metaphor and problematic you don't wanna ban it it we actually [1607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1607.56s)

want to have it be helpful leave double-click on why yeah there are elements of parallel processing and elements of serial processing that are important and then there's something that can't be fully contained in parallel and serial and the thing that i am sensing jordan's calling coherence is what is our we do we have a model where we're reducing consciousness to [1630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1630.18s)

computation and if not what consciousness is other than computation as part of the limits of that model yeah i don't know where this comes from but i think it might be yeah union analysis perhaps but the notion of the third they talked about in like dyadic relationships and sometimes they'll even do couples therapy whether it's almost like you know a plate for elijah or you [1649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1649.41s)

know like you see for elvis it's like there's the third and the third is the intelligence of the relationship and is the third you know a working place the idea that there is between an among us but not specific to any of us an additional intelligence that can emerge and that is that that is that the differentiator between what you were describing is coherence and simply maybe [1676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1676.17s)

[[collective intelligence]] or proper coordination your coordination yep okay very i'm gonna say yes okay yeah and so i'm wanting to translate different ontology listeners might be coming from and say there's a couple at least a couple different ways we can think about this both of which are meaningful so there's a question of can we come into a type of relationship as beings [1706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1706.97s)

where there is a kind of synergy a kind of coherence where there's actually an [[emergent property]] of something antek that then has a top-down effect in us we can actually listen to that and there's some interesting kind of metaphysical propositions that would make that be the case and i would say that's interesting and then there's also the well if that's not true and mine is still processing in [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1733.73s)

separate brains is there still something we're intending to listen in to the group as opposed to just myself and just having the intention to consider the perspectives of everyone there consider the relationships between everyone there consider the group as a whole not just the individuals and the individuals and speak what could be relevant and useful for everyone and feel think about that [1765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1765.08s)

and feel into it use your whole self i don't have to have a ontology of an emergent collective consciousness to have that process be a useful thing so is there a point jordan is is it helpful or problematic to consider so let's say what you just said which is let's call it super skillful active collective listening right where it's it you can take first person second person third [1794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1794.179s)

person perspectives fluidly in order to help both you know articulate it extract make sense of as much information and [[sensemaking]] as we can together that feels sort of secular humanist rational that's just us being better people playing better together is there anything - what is gained and lost by positing the third positing a transpersonal element that may even [1819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1819.94s)

render us our individuality sub ordinate - so clearly right so so in a lot of traditional societies they might have some wild-ass crazy ritual well like you know haitian vodou nor something like that and there may be the there is a god or a spirit that this ritual is dedicated to and when enough of us lose our separate sin itself they would have they would tell the story or [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1847.12s)

make the meaning that that is when the spirit of such-and-such has come through right if we're talking about post rational coherence is there a thing that is super ordinate to us if so is that helpful in the sense of like get out of the way all right we're landing the mothership or is it problematic because it creates magical thinking projections and other [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1871.68s)

stuff well interestingly i think we actually have a nice self referentiality that just happens right here because so the first step might be something like something i call a paradigm mapping and daniel actually did paradigm that many moment ago so you take a particular story that somebody's telling and you point by point map it to a particular paradigm so i could describe that in [1896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1896.26s)

terms of cognitive science and say okay what's really happening is that when we create a proposition that there's a third what this does in our own minds is that it allows us to no longer have an emotional attachment to the rightness or the wrongness a particular idea which gives rise to a cognitive capacity to be more creative more fluid in explorations and therefore is a more generative way [1918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1918.7s)

it's a it's a form of hack that allows us to have that cognitive disposition right so i just did a mapping to a kind of language in cognitive science that would take somebody who loads and runs cognitive science as a [[sensemaking]] framework and make them go okay that makes sense feels good my i don't feel scared or angry about what's happening right now that feels like a feasible [1940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1940.45s)

thing but of course the meta proposition is that mapping it to a paradigm full stop at all is the problem so anytime you're actually trying to make sense by mapping to a paradigm whether the paradigm is a you know vishnu or the god pan or cognitive neuroscience or whatever you're already recapturing the discourse in a particular way of thinking that [1968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=1968.61s)

limits its capacity to be the thing we're trying to actually do so the answer to the question is like if the answer the question like the classic buddhists just whack you in the back of the head like that's the only real response to that kind of a question is don't go that direction sure okay so so yes and then but he so if coherence is this ephemeral [[emergent property]] the best never named the never subject to reality captured reality tunnel capture like it's that thing then how the hell do skill it cuz we're storytelling monkeys and at some point we need recipes to help the thing propagate so this good unless everybody's job yodas then why does it always break down mm-hmm why do why are we to meet we just go doesn't break down [2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2019.73s)

one of the reasons is because as our friend lao tzu discovered and by the way also a friend buddha discovered enter friend jesus discovered every time the storytelling monkeys try to turn to a story to tell they  __  it up so let's be mindful of that and recognize that the storytelling piece of it definitely isn't the answer okay so sherlock holmes style now carve [2043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2043.66s)

that out of the available portfolio of things that we can do how do we go about doing anything at all that doesn't involve being a storytelling monkey okay we've got it we've got an arrow problem it's it's smaller it's a smaller space but you know so let's just think i mean if you know where we are culturally these days there's a lot of people are stumbling into these spaces via broad [2065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2065.899s)

access to ecstatic technologies so whether that's transformational ffedith festivals or you know transformational technologies or whatever it is or psychopharmacology you know all these things people are bumbling into these spaces on purpose or not they're getting there they're recognizing holy  __  we're in the deep end and or this is rad this is awesome this is terrifying this [2090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2090.44s)

is powerful right whatever it will be they they're they know it when they're getting there even if they're not a hundred percent sure how they got there and then the moment they're no longer in that coherent field we're back to trying to make sense of it in the prison-house of language telling stories and making analogies or metaphors so let's take a distinction i [2114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2114.04s)

think we this distinction i think is quite helpful there's at least two distinct uses of language this one over here i'll call semantic reality mapping this is really good for things like building houses or putting together battle plans it orient's coordinated behavior where the checksum of reality is pretty strong science does a lot of this science is [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2145.29s)

pretty much this kind of thing over here is poetry parable where the fingers pointing to the moon and the point is the moon not the finger this we can use we're just to be very careful that we're not doing this so the problem that i think happens all the time particular with the folks that wear lots of feathers and like to take too many drugs is they do this so they have an [2169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2169.329s)

experience and then try to turn to science so pre-scripted versus descriptive both really they do prescription and description because poetry is not really description it's an octave figurative versus literal yes yeah so the trick is we have to actually be able to use language is some way of creating a resonance frequency or protocol match that generates a capacity [2195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2195.339s)

for communication that is not itself specifically semantic which i would propose both parable and poetry do it orient's you in the direction of a feeling in yourself like think about poetry when you read a poem you don't understand the poem but there's something about the way that the poem coordinates language helps you weren't in yourself to an experience that feels [2223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2223.93s)

like the feeling that the poet was also feeling and so it creates a possibility of there being a connection at the level of interior feeling not a connection at the level of understanding well something something you're i mean it felt like you did have some future forward practicality and application in your initial description you said it [2253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2253.539s)

does well with novelty and it's anti fragile and there's me as you thought of it feel like timeless qualities but it for sure feels important now and going forward and and i was wondering because if we can't do the here's the instructions on how to get back here because then we've named a thing that's not the thing and emergent coherence is kind of this [2278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2278.94s)

weird slippery thing to pin down you have communities of practice like quakers and others that have spent centuries and even you know generations passing on that knowledge i was just with some indigenous for dna and lakota folks right and they have an infinite tradition of we will talk until the thing that needed to get done emerges but nor are we on the clock and if this [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2311.22s)

takes ten minutes so be it if this takes 10 days so be it so is there a version of this that is you know kind of quote-unquote scalable in the 21st century for our current situations and conditions and also [[nervous system|nervous systems]] and time scales / distract abilities or are those incompatible and we actually need to say if you humans groups of humans care about the possibility space that [2349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2349.51s)

coherence might afford us then you're going to need to unplug and have a different value set than contemporary mainstream norms and bit rates cominius is pretty simple if somebody says they want to become a to play basketball for in for the for the lakers they probably ought to become a really good basketball player i mean the real answer is that these lineage [2381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2381.2s)

traditions indicate to us that the human instrument has a particular ambient capacity to achieve of things this thing coherent okay our job is to get really really good at that to take that particular ami in capacity and hone it to a level that is the equivalent of a contemporary marathon runner or a contemporary sprinter honing the instrument of running in a way that a [2406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2406.309s)

stone-age human can't become the usain bolt of coherence is the answer to the question it's there it's clearly possible you're not becoming usain bolt though remember once the five-minute mile was at the five-minute mile the three minute mile four-minute mile once the four-minute mile was broken which was considered to be impossible now you've got high school students who can [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2432.829s)

do it and it says one of those things where once you actually get your particular node there's a possible this is a location the possibility space of homo sapiens sapiens but can actually achieve that particular point get there and then build this the tech name of that and bring other people into that place and use that to discover how to actually scale it here i think you're [2456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2456.859s)

asking very important and also the hardest questions and we don't have some of the previous structures together yet that we would deem through so when you talk about how would we have a kind of coherence of collective [[sensemaking]] and collective choice making at scale well we've never had at that scale right as you're mentioning there was a certain level that some tribes were able to [2486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2486.289s)

develop it was part of how tribal life happened and we know that below [[dunbar number]] and above done row number there's really fundamental and then number is not a number it's arranged based on the level of coherence of the type of people more coherence better communication protocols slightly bigger number but one way of thinking about the [[dunbar number]] is a level at which the communication protocols that mediate the coherence break down which is what you're asking a scale question as you mentioned we'll talk it out if it takes 10 days if i've got less than 150 people say and there's a big decision that's gonna affect everybody's life everyone can actually enter a tribal conversation and all get to be part of something that's gonna affect them which [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2535.02s)

means everyone sense-making can be held together this was your question around parallel and series right it's like both those everybody [[sensemaking]] can be heard and then choice making can factor everybody [[sensemaking]] but if i met thousands of people there's no way to have everybody talk to even hear each other without some kind of technology - and so then tribes got bigger than that [2554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2554.46s)

by certain kinds of evolutionary forcing functions by instituting things like command and control hierarchy that controlled the communication flows where some people were doing choice making not informed by the [[sensemaking]] of the whole and now you get diminishing returns on [[collective intelligence]] and that's been the only scaling methods we've had and that was that angry gods [2575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2575.13s)

hypothesis thing that we were sure yeah there's many different technologies for maintaining that particular style of [[collective intelligence]] which of course i could - is called game a like a whole whole way of solving that problem yeah basically game a and scaling coordination or that are pretty synonymous scaling coordination beyond the [[dunbar number]] huh meaning all the other additional bells and whistles of game a you would you would assert basically i kind of follow on for how do you how do you control and coordinate resources and humans beyond 100 250 yeah yeah money formal hierarchy the notion of formality in general the idea that there's a role that somebody fills as opposed to humans are just humans and sometimes like that minute from formal [2622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2622.65s)

subordination to dynamic subordination that shift law policing each one of these are just tools in the gaming a toolkit that are all endeavoring to solve that problem shared n group identity like political left or nationality or religion or race or whatever this allows a coordination of an in-group relative to an out group in an assumed rivalrous context and so game a is basically rivalrous [[game theory]] there's a way of stating it and sort of it has three distinct challenges that it's always trying to solve for it's trying to solve for is it able to coordinate so as to maintain the integrity of the whole in the context of nature get it feed everybody is it able to coordinate in the context of each other its able to avoid defection or [2669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2669.259s)

group selection inside its interior or just corruption and is it able to coordinate because of the other things of the same kind that are doing the same thing that you're trying to steal each other's drinking shudders milkshake alright and you now have history and you have the failure of all the previous civilizations because of breakdowns in those three okay so then let's imagine [2690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2690.619s)

the game be groovy coherence version how do how do we play this let's assume that the kind of cats out of the bag people are stumbling and bumbling into at least transient coherence via more and less more or less and durable means these days and that could literally be site routes at boom festival and portugal plus [[psychedelics]] is doing something and there and the whole reason [2722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2722.869s)

that there's an even sai-san's edm movement i come i can't listen to the stuff personally but i've heard i've heard people who have been skeptical finding themselves in the middle of one of those [[dance]] floors with premium function one acoustic tunes sound systems you know and again overlaid with [[psychedelics]] overlaid with large crowds of people light sound all of those kind [2745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2745.789s)

of transformative technologies dropping into something how what you know how do we enter this post conventional communitas coherence whatever it be without them moment the kind of the peak of it wears off reverting back to a game a power structures in [[game theory]] because that's what i keep seeing i see people glimpsing it people of being lit up [2775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2775.049s)

recognizing it as something new important magical profound healing fill-in-the-blank starting to even agree to organize around it where new family where tribe we're gonna where were the frothy edge of evolution whatever it would be and then the wheels come off monday morning when the checks have to be stroked or when the project you know the project plans are late or we start [2799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2799.74s)

getting back into nitty gritty 3d yeah so this is what i was trying to say earlier i'll say it again i think maybe more actively so when you think about we've got the concept of game you think about game a there's two pieces to it or two aspects or elements one element is let's just call it society and they're they're elements here is mind so there's a particular mind that you're running to [2829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2829.74s)

be able to run the code of your society and society is effective to the degree to which it has code that works and minds that run it well okay well if you delete this oh but you're still running this yes i've just had my side trance experience and i've had connection to the godhead and what i do immediately without even a second hesitation as i immediately began running it on the old [2857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2857.099s)

code i am recapitulate in the old code i'm gonna get the same out no matter what every time which is you know every single time you see for example my the aforementioned individuals who have been the kotick or great teachers the past who studiously didn't write things down and immediately were followed by people who did which me became a state religion which immediately started the process of [2880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2880.97s)

killing other people in their name them it's a pretty interesting story how gay mead does that so the first answer is they wanted the christ we got joel osteen oh yeah how do you not do this what's another kind of mind you might run well okay that's actually a very tricky question because to think about it involves invoking the mind that is not to be to get rid of itself so the [2905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2905.67s)

answer is first slow way the  __  down think developmental right we're going to actually have to go all the way down to conception in the developmental pathway and only do that which is in fact actually within the coherence that we have in fact actually have achieved this is why i said you actually have to go to that center and then build out so let's say you want to say okay we've achieved [2936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2936.06s)

coherence and now let's build a an organization that's like saying i'm a three-month-old i'm gonna go drive a race car nope sorry what can you do maybe you can kind of have a conversation that isn't going into game a maybe sadly but development has a really cool thing you can get better at it so the first is to actually really recognize the absolute [2966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2966.42s)

irreducible necessity of comprehensively rebooting mind all the way down were you saying all the way down down what down to childhood and infancy like early childhood development as we do with conception so jordan's got infant right now and we were so he's very much in that active process of watching and supporting development we were talking about the other day i don't know if it's [2997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=2997.68s)

true or not but there's at least a story of some native american tribes were when they're teaching language rather than and the kid first starts asking the what questions what's that what's that what's that rather than say it's a crow in a mountain and a buffalo they would say that is the great spirit expressed as a crow the great spirit expressed as a mountain great spirit expresses buffalo [3020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3020.27s)

so their initial semiotic s-- their initial ontology had the interconnectivity of everything first and then the distinction and so when you say all the way down it's like to the level of do i identify as a separate self in my own experience that can get the design game-theoretic relationship to you and identify you as other do i experience that or do i experience some [3047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3047.24s)

kind of deeper connectivity in which synergy is the only thing that makes sense okay so now we're into an interesting neck of the woods right by the way just practically speaking though somewhere around eleven ten eleven is a good place that's the level of mind from like concrete operational on up noting that you have to also deal with all the stuff that's going on in the body in [3075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3075.38s)

that pre period so if you haven't resolved childhood trauma or anything that's going on in terms of even simple things like bilateral integration do not the right kind of developmental environment you're gonna have challenges you have to actually work that whole thing that's my conception the stuff that happens those developmental stages going back and making sure that the [3093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3093.82s)

instrument is in fact a fully functioning human instrument all the way up and then of course when you get to that childhood adolescence phase that's where a lot of the paradigmatic stuff starts to begin to layer in and of course everything that you learn from 17:18 on you should put go ahead and shelve most of that shelve it in what way like don't allow or don't allow it to make sense of reality from that's the indoctrination into game a formatting information semantics yes it's the code all the code that you've been running that partitions reality into prefabricated true and good bits and bits yes when you said we're getting somewhere interesting i want to know [3139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3139.64s)

where you want to go yeah it was well it was specifically what you were describing as far as you know the apocryphal indigenous traditions right that never semantically encoded separation of self constantly infused this is a this is this is great spirit as it you know has annex rushon and and and you know presumed or inferred i think is a pre enlightenment [3161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3161.58s)

pre rational sense of selfhood that was actually permeable liminal and you know this is the bicameral mind if you know like if that's it that neck of the woods the idea of hey maybe back in the day humans no matter how much our hollywood movies you know project back 20th and 21st century valley's underwear sandal bible epics you know we actually people conceived of different cells in [3186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3186.3s)

fundamentally different ways their boundaries of self were more permeable and they were able to connect in preconventional collective sense which actually was the subjugation of the self and the subjugation of the of serenity because that stuff hadn't even necessarily come online in the ways we tend to think of it then you've got you know rational french enlightenment [3209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3209.37s)

articulation a hyper individual ego separate selves and then our efforts in this era say 1700 to roughly now right the only time is probably the seventies yeah we've had these we've had fascism communism cults i mean it was cults and colonies right that notion of the subjugation of the self to the collective and it's at odds with our value sets and is often been super [3235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3235.44s)

problematic so this question is is how might we other than just growing your humans which you know i hear you saying for obvious reasons how might we get to a post conventional collective coherence that rather than subjugating individual sovereignty actually foregrounds it and pretty to preserve animates it protects it and at the same time we have that dynamic subordination or you know not [3266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3266.1s)

[[game theory]] capture we play well with each other no one sucking grabs the ring right and we all create the the council of elrond so you just set up hyper individualism and some kind of oneness or collectivism as a thesis antithesis and you're asking about synthesis it's one way of framing it and so far in the conversation for whatever reason you've been doing a [3292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3292.15s)

beautiful job of asking questions but i kind of want to ask back since i know this is exactly the center of what you're focused on how do you see that synthesis emerging beats me man i mean i feel like to your point a little bit like we have to train we have to practice you know you said everybody could become a same bull but like you can't make a soccer team [3312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3312.28s)

whether you're saying bow there's only one of those sons-of-bitches and he's faster than everybody else right and so i honest to god don't know it feels like there needs i mean as as like i hear what you're saying from the kind of full-on like zen cohen of it like don't name the thing and on the other hand if we are looking to migrate people into at least beginning to [3334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3334.6s)

practice it together however messily and imperfectly what are the liberating structures what are the rules to the infinite game right even if baked into the rules of the infinite game or it's not the rules either how can we do that so that we don't have these glimpses of something more shared between us that continually seem to unspool and you know and here's a few that i've seen i mean i [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3364.54s)

think the key thing is to recognize that obviously we don't know how because otherwise we already would have and that's crucial it's important so it's worth continuing to try which of course all of us know intuitively but it seems important to keep putting it out there and my sense is at least my own personal experience is that it's becoming more clear like i don't feel like i've been [3388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3388.93s)

wandering in the desert coming back to the same place now it feels like actually there is more and more clarity so i'll give you some examples of things that seem to be more right than wrong so one is let's just take the concept of learning now what i want to do is i want to i want to shift and this is not novel like this happens there's keats i think it's key is just to hold things in the [3413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3413.59s)

right order the difference between teaching and cultivating epiphany and so teaching is i give you a set of information i through any particular means generally rote endeavor to cause you to be able to repeat that information back to me and verify that you've absorbed it in a way that has high fidelity alright so that is coding its software and i'm creating some sort [3442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3442.71s)

of software mapping in you in cultivating epiphany i try to find some how to actually generate in you the insight they gave rise to that being the thing in the first place all right so it's not even teach a man to fish but cultivate in a man the the capacity of becoming fisherman in himself fine that distinction is definitely one of the distinctions [[generator function]] more than output that's a way of putting it okay and then we go season now i've got some thoughts on how to do that synthesis you said that was one of the distinctions no i think this this useful thing of saying hey here's the here's the stuff i found and you know most of it has been a disaster but there's a few that actually kind of work so it's this let's see what else we got okay so [3500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3500.88s)

here's a few we talked about coherence of difference rather than coherence of sameness like heterogeneous coherence correct so when you're talking about the subordination of the individual versus individuality there's something having to do with that there is a meaningfulness and a beauty and a dignity of the individual that we don't want to subordinate in some kind of [3528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3528.84s)

homogenizing way we don't want to decrease the diversity that leads to the resilience of life right and then the richness of it a my own discernment and choice making even as i'm part of a collective that feels really important right and then simultaneously there are kinds of diversity and difference that only lead to unreconciled bol entropic conflicts and so those are not interesting kinds of diversity and so we want as much diversity as we can create synergy across we get maximum synergy from maximum diversity with maximum parallax so now think about for a moment with the idea of parallax and just just to find that if it was like so parallax in terms of the way the two eyes neither eye has [3578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3578.309s)

depth perception or peripheral vision right and when i have both eyes together they they have a lot of shared things that they see but because they're in different locations they also have slightly different things that they see so there's overlap a difference right and this is important so when i put the two together they're not competing for which one is right that would be [3599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3599.999s)

ridiculous right they're actually the optical cortex is putting the information together in a way where if there's actually an error in this one it's corrected by what this one's doing so they error correct each other and then because i can compute the hypotenuse of the triangle i actually get depth perception and periphery so the two eyes together give things that [3620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3620.819s)

neither of them did separately plus aircraft shape so i want them to have some shared reality and i want them to find their shared reality but i also want them to have difference and then i want them to relate in a deep way and then i wouldn't want my ears to be more eyes right like there's a deeper kind of parallax between ears and eyes where eyes are giving me location of things [3640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3640.259s)

and ears are giving me a different kind of location thing so the ears with each other give me echolocation and the ears and the eyes together give me a different kind of [[sensemaking]] in 3-space so we are mr. potato head so if you think about like every imagine if the ears and eyes were just fighting over which was right and the other one was one was comprehensively right in a [3660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3660.209s)

complete description of reality and the other was comprehensively wrong that would be ridiculous we would dissolve into gibberish right there is a place where they all have accurate information about reality and it's all partial this speaks to them that initiatives like the third that you mentioned so in the context when the relationship between the eyes in the ears [3678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3678.059s)

there's a third we know that third that's our experience our open vote yeah right so then the question is okay eub eyes over years where's our third but it didn't need about that is that then you get some very interesting things where on the one hand you have both of us actually have a clear awareness in ourselves that we are here to with fidelity report what we perceive [3709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3709.74s)

of reality we are deeply cognizant of the fact that that is not reality we are deeply cogs into the fact that the other is here to report reality and that somehow there is something that can happen that gives a deeper grasp of reality and the reason when i'm zooming in on that is that it actually a lot of the characteristics of this kind of place have to do with a a way to fully [3747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3747.69s)

and deeply honor like all to  __  you know without the least bit of attachment to any of it and that's key you have to actually we're not in the it's not the priests the trans so we actually want to know lots of stuff i want to have really amazing frameworks we want to have a lot of life experience i want to bring that all the way in but then we also didn't [3772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3772.23s)

want to have complete non attachment to any of it and be able to code of create a bespoke since synthetic language in real time if necessary okay so that's kind of interesting i mean i loved all that okay so i want to add something to this because this is actually like this is really exciting to me so i've got lots of senses right and they're all taking in some true information they can [3794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3794.28s)

all have error and they're all partial i also have lots of actuator i can move lots of different muscles and of course the the leg doesn't want the to compete with the arm for which one gets to be the actuator it actually wants to not just coordinate but to be in a kind of coherence right and so i've got lots of sensory stuff i got lots of actuator stuff why is it that it's not just [3816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3816.21s)

random splotches of color and sound but it comes together into a coherence of self and world and self in relationship with world as a coherence phenomena so how all the sensing comes together inside of me is a coherence melena that's the binding problem in neuroscience right and in the philosophy of mind and then the actuator why am i not how do all those parts work together [3837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3837.39s)

so well as a coherence phenomenon so if we think about that every human on their own the next level up is sensing making sense and activating but then when we come together like i want you sensing stuff differently than i am and i trust that there is information in that that i actually really want to have access to myself and i want the collective to have and i want you actuated differently than [3864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3864.99s)

i am but i really want to come into coherence so in almost right i mean i wasn't kind of like that the joke about mr. potato head is actually kind of like who is the third right if we personify and your sounds like so we're all different organs bringing different perspectives when we come together we get dimensionality right we get up whether it's echolocation of binocular [3889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3889.71s)

vision we get more out of aggregating and integrating our realities and that then becomes as you said not just fragmented data feeds it becomes a gestalt boom though it becomes a reality for some supersensible version of us that is greater than the sum of its parts yeah so you said initial conditions good with [3918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3918.75s)

novelty and auntie fragile but what and then you also said hey the mind that's running like you take the societal structure off but the mind the mind that was formatted to support this assisted [[social structure]] persists even if you have this experience it's gonna get looped back through old with fundamentally gamei habits and patterns which sounds super  __  fragile this [3942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3942.819s)

right like like right now coherence is highly highly fragile yes and yet you're also saying it either has an inherent property or maybe you just hope that it would be ultimately eventually anti fragile can we pull that up up because i think i wouldn't be having this conversation if it was a done deal or if the first time people glimpsed it we're like  __  got it let's go rock [3969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3969.369s)

with this this is actually wildly delicate right now yeah i think this if you if you hold in your mind the example the game of game that this happens of you like the best current example of coherence and it really is like in the entire universe as far as we know it by the best actual example of coherence and then we say okay well if we do the anthropology and we take a look back and [3995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=3995.23s)

say okay well how long did it take to pull that  __  together finding the member i had that spot in possibility space so imagine a cube and in that cube let's make the cube 1 million by 1 million by 1 million so it's a big cube ok and all over there are different kinds of phenotypes hominids happened to be a sphere about a thousand by a thousand by a thousand in that cute [4023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4023.099s)

mollusks are down here right inside the sphere of hominid there's an even smaller sphere which is homo sapiens which is maybe five by five by five in terms of the possibility space and you're talking sentient biomass what's your what's your million cube my cube is the well it's actually an n-dimensional space but i'm reducing it to three to make it work so don't put indexes on [4048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4048.9s)

otherwise it's go talk down to the beta for example didn't exam doesn't does it hold it so the how do you find in the totality of all the things that are going on a particular complex that hangs together to particular homeostatic autocatalytic phenomenon that has the thing and necessary for it to actually hold coherently all right so what happens is [4069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4069.63s)

that there's a lot of different exploration around this little place just think of it as a place if you're not of sapiens right so in hominid you got primate and you got hominid and you smaller and smaller in prime in hominid there's all these sort of explorations of ok how does this thing where the different ways to play in this hominid game and as you kind of get closer to [4091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4091.839s)

the the location of homo sapiens you got you know homo erectus right and you got a little heidelbergensis there's a some things come together but it takes like a million and a half years to actually land on boop there's the thing that actually has all the different elements together by the way meta contextual it has not just the physiological capacities but it also has grand mothers [4114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4114.91s)

and fathers who can actually support the neoteny authentic necessity for this plus sista to be able to actually emerge with culture so there's a bunch of  __  that's been put together through [[evolutionary process]] it's exploring the space of possibility and as it kind of hits there's enough bending of the space of possibility until orbits around that spot alright now if you take that we're [4136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4136.029s)

looking at something which is inside that homo sapiens sapiens spot and my hypothesized by the way has been there the whole time which just finds a meta [[art]] coming here but we're not gonna go into tlt ology that is maybe it's one by one when it's a small territory but we can notice when so first we can use that as an example of saying okay this is how hard it is so we're gonna kind of vector [4160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4160.029s)

in that direction and what kind of like buddhism will emerge and kind of move the game forward a little bit and we'll kind of learn some interesting stuff and then collapse them christianity will happen and look at him do its thing and a big level up occurs and the general sort of state of homo sapiens but we don't quite get there so now we're at this point where like all right given [4177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4177.279s)

everything we know and given the timeframe that we think we may have actually to pull this off what's the process by which we explored and of course again the point that i'm saying is to degree to which as an individual you can put yourself inside the sphere that defines this location you can get there then in that place can you bring other people into [4198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4198.37s)

that place and in that place just that group what can happen there and this then the conception metaphor so now we're moving from the long-term market the species level is just took at the long-term are up at the individual level the fertilized egg is fragile in the context of once it goes through its developmental arc extraordinarily resilient being an adult human is kind [4226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4226.69s)

of a kick-ass animal really really good at being animal but of course the fertilized egg is still extremely fragile so the question when i asked is like well what's our womb well i'd actually push back on that i'd say a  __  adult human this is a is a weak naked kicked by everybody but with culture with the instruction manual he's badass [4251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4251.02s)

i actually disagree i would point out that the the things that just basic humans can do like the roche it accurately are actually rather astounding in the context of the animal kingdom and the plasticity of the design parameters with human body can actually be trained to do that is not coded in the instinct of a given animal is as impressive as the flexibility at the [4273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4273.58s)

level of ideal space that there is no baryshnikov in the animal kingdom and to the egregious there is the prison to carve that animal cannot also then become an aretha franklin i think that's actually pretty  __  intense how much plasticity in design parameters in this particular physical body then of course you layer that plug that actuation capacity the plasticity of actuation [4296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4296.41s)

capacity in with the plasticity of perception and ideation obviously that thing is got well it gets you to the moon and back but i think the the the proposition that i think you're hitting on like the key question is recognizing that the definition or the necessary and sufficient condition of coherence that i was describing is very much the adult form the mature form [4320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4320.71s)

and so it is very much the case in my experience the coherence as it currently is able to manifest ever ever actually able to establish it is extremely fragile and quite difficult to hold together even in just ordinary conditions much less than quite challenging conditions so the the question of scaling it is a question actually of how do we simultaneously [4346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4346.63s)

increase its let's call it strength its capacity to maintain coherence under a wide variety of different conditions its scope the degree to which it can actually bring in more people and its depth the degree to which it's actually able to fully realize the synergy value of those people like instead of like a narrowband broadband so the question of how do we [4376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4376.679s)

scale coherence i think is all three of those simultaneously if you would if you mind if we can go back to the initiative like the little things that seemed to be seem to be true one of the other ones that i've found is that most of the failures to show up seem to actually fail for relatively simple reasons having to do with either the particularity zuv how human [4416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4416.739s)

development in world delivers certain kinds of trauma or the particular it is about the coming to being of homo sapiens delivery what you might call a species level trauma so either people who are entering into coherence enter into relations of codependency where you've talked about you know the victim mindset and the savior mindset like these are all habitual responses that [4441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4441.2s)

are either hard-coded into homo are coded in what humaneness is at the at the more sort of a primal level or because we are human beings who universally have been developed in the context of society we've developed an enormous lee large number of blind spots bad habits and traumas as a consequence of that so sort of step one of these sort of you know things that seem to [4468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4468.53s)

work is you have to actually gone through all the work of actually at the very least resolving yourself out of the trauma of society to the extent that you know to pretty high extent to be perfectly honest and then having a capacity of being conscious of how biological instincts and habits that are hardwired below the developmental level are going to show up in relationship so [4495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4495.23s)

being able to go through that level of training and there seems to be a kind of a minimum of those two that pete anyone has to be at some level of development along both those kinds of work to be able to enter any coherence at all yeah and so because now we're dealing obviously there are no folks comfortably camping out in a happy game be land and anybody who are going to be the trail [4523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4523.489s)

breakers pioneers bridge builders are going to have to be shedding game a conditioning and potentially accumulated traumas and at least but i think you know we've had some of these conversations to folks that are breaking trail and even let's say folks that are breaking trail and leading the way and even fairly often bringing others into experiences of coherence themselves [4548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4548.11s)

suddenly too significantly still traumatize the wounded healers right and so and even in an instant specifically we people to come across a community that's dedicated to working on all those traumas in fact there's then there's quite a few there's quite a few that you know engaging in their access point to communitas is through helping people better engage experience catharsis right [4572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4572.83s)

and then you get this ecstatic moment of like holy  __  yeah we're healed we're whole we're connected isn't this beautiful and amazing and then it unspools right there and the question is like well wait is it just we need to do more of the thing that these guys are already doing they were partial or they weren't quite there yet and do we get into some puritanical [4593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4593.35s)

increasingly high buff or who gets to play at the coherence game because you know you're bringing your dirty shoes into our pure petri dish like how do we actually help the transitional generations generations well i think you already said that key piece so one is humility the other is patience i think one of the problems that tends to happen is there's a real significant meaningful [4617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4617.889s)

breakthrough which then takes itself up set as having been to the breakthrough oh we did it awesome we're there right as opposed to a okay this is probably a three to five maybe six generation process so it's a more like this this less like this movement and directionality with just an incomprehensible level of constantly going into humility and recognizing that [4645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4645.58s)

no matter how much seems to have been done we may only be eight percent of the way there and so that's a lot left and some since that's that but you can always get you can get closer and and if when you are closer this is crucial right being able to distinguish the difference between when you are more towards that unless and then being able to notice that the choices that are [4675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4675.04s)

coming from more towards that are the ones that should be leading your choice making and the choices that are coming from less from that other one should be trailing and fading so you actually become a vector and so that then you become better and better at using that sense of more like this that's like this in more and more of your choices you [4695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4695.42s)

actually begin to get a very nice progressive movement in that container of humility and patience with enough runway and enough tolerance for creative destruction because you talked about you'd run away well time danny because you talked about like hey humans are amazing and check us out we can figure out living in the arctic in the deserts well not really [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4718.19s)

you drop any single naked monkey in either of those places they're dead in 72 hours but right right but but enough clothes but no cigars and some lucky bastard finally figures it out and then that gets encoded in culture and then not everybody has to die and suddenly where it desert tribe or where did the inuit right so so how do we do this if right there's both fragility and not in [4740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4740.06s)

definite time i am reminded of the movie the martian what i notice is that there's a another trap two traps actually one trap is the trap of urgency and the other trap is the trap of like perceived a responsibility when you say it's a trap of urgency meaning the perception and then the acting as if or do you mean the actual the perception of the acting as if which is in fact fully [4766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4766.43s)

accurate fully accurate perception and the acting as if is a trap right it's the it's the notion of you know james bond defusing the bomb the clock is ticking he has to actually be acting as nonchalant as if he's in the process of you know swirling his martini because even the least bit of feeling and urgency guarantees failure it's the mountaineering go slow to go fast right [4794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4794.75s)

exactly so that's another key right and this happens all the time as you get it and now you can see it happen i've seen that happen many times in myself or there's a recognition of the urgency which leads to a certain hardening and a certain willingness to explain moving into either things that are not yet actually possible into here or rationalizing pulling from the game a [4814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4814.86s)

toolkit oh that's a doozy you're done okay that speaks very much to what you are saying in terms of people falling out of their state and we could talk about what a stage development take from state experience but we could also talk about what are the sources of fragility if we want to talk about antifragility we should understand the sources of fragility and what we can do with those [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4844.11s)

and so some simple constructs if we're endeavoring to create some kind of coherence we could have that breakdown from internal forces or external forces are both right so external forces means rivalrouss type dynamics which is an in-group that is smaller than everything given that it is still interacting with the rest of the world that it's embedded in so i would say all in groups that are [4871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4871.32s)

smaller than everything have some inherent fragility of that kind then we can look at dynamics on the inside that could cause fragility and breakdown which is actually going into rivalrous type dynamics with each other because the coherence that brings about the synergy that brings about the emergent capacities that actually gets selected for happens because of a kind of [4893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4893.849s)

relating that is anti rivalrous it allows a very deep type of synergy to occur i'd like to have a proposal meta and then meta meta move the meta move i'm noticing that the conversation has a particular topology to it i'm curious why that's the case so it's meta because i presume that the answer to that curiosity will have something to do with either homos we are [4922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4922.98s)

in fact primates or something about our developmental environment this causes topology to choose spontaneously emerge which is to say that the conversation is a v daniel's talking to you i'm talking to you daniel and i are not talking to each other and there is no third like something right there yeah so that's one that's the meta move why why is why did that topology settle in the [4950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4950.54s)

way that it settled in then the the meta meta move they unfortunate oh the meta meta move is of course in the act of actually contemplating the meta we can in fact endeavor to be doing it rather than talking about it and we can notice how the doing it informs the talking about it in a fashion that resolves the question and in addition to the three of us and whatever the container or [4977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=4977.12s)

emergent is this is also on film and there's the consciousness of the people who are watching it which i'm also sensing into and wanting to make sure that this is hopefully useful for so that's included in the consideration something between comprehensible and/or interesting there's a third to the enth i mean i i would at least i feel like there was never been moments little [5010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5010.239s)

blips where there's been at least for me new or interesting perspectives and our house and insights and i don't know whether that's things i just haven't heard you guys say before or whether those are actually you know imagine that yes what i'm noticing is that i'm noticing a feeling that they're not being something coming from daniel that actually creates the right kind of [5037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5037.33s)

symmetry in the conversation so i'm interested in getting your perspective in a fashion that is not responsive but is in fact direct like coming from the inside out the thing that was feeling to share i just didn't hear a spot where it was in it was relevant actually very much connects to the conversation that the two of you were having but it was what i [5069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5069.55s)

was thinking about anyways which is this relationship between the subordination of the individual for the collective and the sovereignty of the individual like fractal sovereignty and i was thinking about the body as an analogy of it's such a fascinating thing where all of the cells are autonomous agents governed by their own internal genetic code they could grow in a petri dish for some [5105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5105.85s)

period of time but they're operating in a way that is both in their own good interest and in the interest of the other cells around them in the entire body simultaneously so there isn't a theory of trade-offs of what is good for them is damaging other or they're sacrificing themselves for other and that's tripped the level of cell-to-cell but it's also true at the level of organ [5125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5125.95s)

to organ and organ systems organ system and cell to organ so at vertical levels and horizontal levels there's this kind of just radical anti rivalrous synergy of sovereign things of things that have their own self-organizing boundary the facha of the organ the cell membrane and we're talking about that at the next level of organism to organism and we've done that up to tribe and now we're [5151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5151.9s)

talking about beyond tribal scale but that that kind of process and i'm thinking about cancer in the body because a cancer cell starts doing what seems to be in the short-term better for it it actually replicates it consumes and replicates faster but it breaks down the coherence of the whole and in the process it ends up killing itself killing its progeny right it suicides [5175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5175.48s)

because it debases the substrate that it depends upon in kind of a short term small-minded focus and so there's this idea like regard to like the there's an interesting feeling even of that way of speaking of it as subordinate the individual and i was just thinking of einstein's quote that it's an optical delusion of consciousness to think there are [5202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5202.29s)

separate things when in fact there is one integrated reality that we call universe and so like we can actually rationally get and something i think about all the time is ok i can think about myself as a separate thing but what am i without the atmosphere i don't even exist what am i without the plants that generate the atmosphere i don't even exist what am i without the electromagnetic field without the earth without gravity without the other people that made the things that i use and the concepts that i use so when i get that i'm an [[emergent property]] of the hole that has uniqueness and individuality but it's not separable from that the distinctness doesn't mean separable 'ti then i have both distinct and inseparable simultaneously so i have [5249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5249.54s)

interconnected with the whole and having a unique role to play and so the dialectic there is something that increases actually the distinction and the uniqueness and increases the synergy and interconnectivity simultaneously and the first part is to just recognize if i'm doing the cancer thing it will end up being bad for what i care about too even if in the short term it seems like [5274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5274.89s)

a good thing and i think that's the thing with rivalries [[game theory]] that we're at the place where we realize exponentially larger extraction and pollution and war an information war is existential now so we can't even rationalize that we can keep doing it that way i'm noticing understand that i'm trying to get to the feeling of it which is by the way quite hard but one [5297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5297.5s)

of the places i landed was that you know we still have that nice example of the jazz band fortunately we actually have concrete examples of what these things are like to be in and i'm noticing that as a player in the jazz band that feeling of not being subordinated to the whole but actually somehow being supported in achieving a higher level of [5322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5322.23s)

individuation is felt so the question of course was that feel like it's interesting to notice that while some people not many i think try to think about that strategically like okay how do i make sure that i am in fact protected most people are in fact proceeding by do i actually feel like i am increasing my autonomy do i feel more agenting and [5345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5345.87s)

more autonomous and more able to express my essence or selfness into world symmetries like what does that feel like to actually move into that place and if we could do it like what would actually have felt like for this single cell going into the multi cell because there's something about the quality of that that we can actually grasp at that level you've done it many [5365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5365.97s)

times it made different modes like you've done it when you've gone like creating a team's doing athletic activities together so they flow into something but where the place where each individual begins to drop into a space where they are at their peak as an individual so yeah and that feels like something you know straight forwardly obvious  __  which is basically my [5398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5398.61s)

coordinators are met and i've seen in my worldview and everything and and my needs are validated such that i can then drop them in order to play you know going from my five finite game of separate self into a more infinite game of emergence and it feels like there also needs to be a tolerance for ambiguity and a willingness to get messy so back to the jazz guys i mean [5421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5421.35s)

consistently the most righteous jams come out of kind of going in down into the mud as a band you know someone's off noodling exploring a theme or you know and it's not actually danceable it's not anything and it's even to the point of just unspooling entirely and then some quicksilver starlight comes out of that you know and then it all joe and it's that patience to your point [5448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5448.42s)

about timing jordan you know it's the patience to let it all come undone in order to come back together in some new emergent form that seems almost essential and and i don't know that when you were just kind of cuz i mean as soon as you described organisms organs and i was like oh yeah okay so [[social media]] digital narcissism  __  scraping everybody else's jam biting people's [5472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5472.449s)

rhymes poaching people's dhamma feels like the cancerous impulse that we're experiencing right now and when we come when we glimpse this emergence or of coherence it's sort of like oh you're you know your life's work and special like the thing you're uniquely designed to do you know what in a traditional sense might be called dhamma you know fits perfectly with the thing i'm [5495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5495.85s)

uniquely here to do and holy  __  i was carrying this thing it was lonely it was hard it was scary it was heavy but now i think that actually these pieces lay down beside each other and now we're actually beginning to see a picture that none of us held and none of us could see and that to me is like i think how this happens but on the other hand we're also having people be like oh that's a pretty [5519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5519.37s)

damn picture let me just scribble it and snap a selfie and  __  post it well there's an interesting that happens there right so as an individual if particularly the social environment if you take responsibility in yourself mmm-me to this right okay so the human instrument i think has a really fine-tuned ability to discern the distinction between those two things so [5537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5537.16s)

you can tell when somebody's faking it in a deep way like something in your gut is telling you something's off they're not connected they're not expressing something that's coming from their heart all right they're playing somebody else's jam or whatever the phrase is that you use if you don't when that happens if you give that attention if you give it energy you are  __  up [5563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5563.08s)

everything it is crucial as an individual that on the one hand when somebody is actually out on the tightrope in the middle of trying to figure out how to express something from the heart that is very chuckles that you actually call it that's gold well done awesome and on the other hand when you feel it no there's something off about that this guy here's [5588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5588.8s)

faking it that you also express that clearly and so the what happens you could have very interesting set of feedback loops to degree to which everybody's playing the game of both participant and curator with authenticity and skillfulness you actually start getting positive feedback loops that move into a space that increasingly anti fragile power but if [5611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5611.81s)

there's defection and the defection here i mean things like laziness or bad habit or of course obviously just don't faction defection like oh i'm gonna steal that and run with it then it doesn't come together so but this is this this is nice right this is fine like two degree to which jamie you show up consistently every single time willing to put it on the line and [5636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5636.77s)

calling what is true true and calling what is false false then and i meet you there trying to do the same thing what ends up happening is that we actually build a relationship that has resilience to it there's strength to it and there's strength to it both in the sense that we can have confidence in it and in the sense that it can do more than a relationship that doesn't have that in [5658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5658.64s)

it so there is actually a natural like orientation towards strength that does show up there but is also based on skillfulness determined at the bottom to be a consumer and a curator because otherwise you got the difference between burning man and fire festival yeah well this is goes back to that problem of society so much with discernment is just like almost the first thing that is [5682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5682.01s)

beaten out is discernment and so being able to come back and do things like recognize the whole thing here is part of discernment and being able to listen and say okay my heart aches when somebody says something alright well that's probably real deep important true learn how to listen to it learn how to speak what it means with clarity so this is i came that minimum ingredient [5704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5704.39s)

discernment is a minimum ingredient and in short supply these days and in short supply but everyone everywhere can actually improve the discernment where they are and it will always make their life better so it's an easy thing to say increase your discernment it's never a bad idea to your earlier call there's actually something that i feel to add the [5724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5724.82s)

conversation that hasn't been spoke to yet but actually was feeling into and wanted to speak to the kind of topology you were noticing because there's a something that i noticed about i think is actually really nice so we could ask is it because jamie is sitting in the corner and it's literally just the physicality of it there's probably a number of factors but it makes heaps of [5749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5749.03s)

sense that you and i have actually got to have more conversations on these topics more recently than we have there's kind of an assumed knowing we didn't all get to jam before on this or prepare this this is real-time extemporaneous and i don't know if you've ever even expressed rule omega to jamie but he's just doing it yeah and he's kind of openly inquiring into the [5772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5772.87s)

questions that are really alive and it's a little bit easier for us to riff off what each other saying because we've got some recently shared language on these things and but the rule omega is actually a really simple practical thing that i towards coherence that i would like everybody here to get is if if jordan mare talking or if you and i are talking like we we have this and i think [5800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5800.87s)

we naturally have it as worth making explicit is if you say something that sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy or wrong i actually give the benefit of the doubt that you might have a reason that i didn't understand first so rather than just default into you're probably wrong ask more questions and and that giving the benefit of the doubt that you actually might have something useful to [5830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5830.0s)

say increases my making sure that i understand you before i'm responding and that actually and the disagreeing was something that you weren't even saying because i didn't seek to understand well enough creates very turbulent flow rather than laminar flow breaks down coherence right if people could just do that towards coherence if they could just [5851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5851.0s)

give the benefit of the doubt that each other that everyone has some signal even if it's on a very different part of reality than the part they're focused on and even if there's noise involved and they're listening for the signal first that would change everything that's a starting place so daniel expresses something and let's see he's trying to suppose something's [5874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5874.73s)

hard which by the way the rule make is designed for that kind of a thing like i'm not interested in having conversations that aren't actually trying to break new ground so okay do it dude so you expressing something hard and in the expression ninety-eight percent is noise and two percent is signal like the chance riff but what happens is that my job is to actually do [5895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5895.07s)

two things one hold all of it not just say  __  that was that wasn't a hundred percent right so i'm just gonna nuke it hold all of it then in my self discernment to what degree can i express something back that gets rid of the fifty fifty percent that is noise so now i've got six percent signal express it back and of course if he can then do that [5918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5918.59s)

and now you three is even better a more profound instrument because you're gonna be bringing a different perspective perhaps you can take it and actually zoom in on it down to the point where actually 50 percent signal that's the idea right and so one it's an invitation to say hey we're trying to do some things hard let's all try to do something [5933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5933.2s)

that's hard to be willing to take the risk of not speaking elegantly and on the premise that everyone else is doing their absolute  __  level best to hear that which is trying to speak itself through you and listening in is in themselves like oh there it is tone got it there's something beautiful and clear there here's what i heard and that's real omega and there's a psychological [5961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5961.76s)

safety that's created to be able to try out new stuff knowing that we know we're trying out new stuff and we're giving the benefit of the doubt so it actually does become more explorative and that's where you get more novelty and then i imagine i don't know if this is true for daniel i imagine it's true for you but certainly if it's true for me is that i'm also noticing [5980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5980.96s)

myself like this constant you know when you're meditating you feel this this constant chatter and flow of like all the things that are going on internally that are either like certain ideas are popping up or emotional responses some of them are like social emotional responses some of them are like just like i got a p and like being able to actually notice all that chatter [5999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=5999.17s)

internally and do the disturbing interior and say okay of all that chatter what's that it's actually signal oh  __  but listen to all of it you have to have you'll make it goes in and out right i'm listening to myself fully and i'm listening to the to the others fully and trying to use discernment to continuously allow that process to turn [6018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6018.28s)

that into gold now there's a really important distinction that we're saying something that is different than the way that some people think about multi-perspective ism which is we're not saying i'm not saying all perspectives are equally valid and i'm also not saying that there is no way to integrate them into higher order understanding i'm saying all perspectives have some signal [6048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6048.61s)

generally have some noise and that perspective is itself a reduction of information on the reality being perceived and that's actually quantum foam of it all from just the definition actually of observer observing observed i can't to take myself out of reality to observe it in a unitary way and if i'm observing you now versus in a different state i'm gonna observe different things [6078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6078.88s)

right someone else at a different time if i'm observing the west side of the house versus the east side of the house versus the aerial view versus inside the house they all give me some signal some truth about the nature of the house none of them give me the whole truth of the nature of the house because it's a 3d object with interior tea in depth and i can't collapse it perfectly into a 2d [6098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6098.11s)

picture right so perspective itself is a reduction on information complexity so the first part i give rule omega to myself that my perspective has some signal but i'm also positive it's incomplete and thinking that my perspective knowing that there's truth in it it's easy to think it's the truth or it's true with a capital t and that's [6123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6123.72s)

like an immaturity we have to get over there's some truth and i'm positive it's incomplete and i think there's a pretty good chance if you've been perceiving the situation you might have some additional truth that i actually really want which means truth is trans perspectival and jordan was saying earlier also transparent attic meaning i have to take multiple perspectives [6144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6144.78s)

through multiple types of interpretation that was at the beginning saying like the words aren't gonna quite get it so we're gonna have to come at it from different perspectives because the words are also in a reduction on the information complexity of the thing this is also a big part of that what happens in the post i have it's pre trans you know what's why is this not a quaker [6164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6164.46s)

meeting the quakers are doing something awesome but they're running one paradigm we have to actually say is okay let's run what's what the very minimum from both the lakota and that quicker paradigms while we're at it i'm usually running i don't know 70 or 90 distinct paradigms simultaneously all the time and there's many and ie and it is not to try to collapse them down to a single [6188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6188.55s)

master paradigm but actually to allow each one of them to have the particular piece that they're holding just like eyes and ears say okay cool this paradigm is able to grasp things in a certain way this one doesn't that's neat recognizing always that you're never going to be able to perceive reality but that by virtue of getting more and more dimensions of parallax you can actually [6205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6205.71s)

have more possibility of having some insight and it's the insight is the key not the sense so you're actually going from [[sensemaking]] into insight which is very different meanings you're sort of outside in inside out yeah right that you're trying to actually build a capacity to be someone who does rather than a knowledge you want to understand know what's happening you wanna be able [6238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6238.5s)

to respond to what's happening so it's you become a musician by virtue of having a skillful portfolio of sensitive qualities in self and then a skillful mapping of that into expression you don't become a musician by being very good at reading somebody else's [[music]] so there's something the thing that i was actually saying that i wanted to add to the conversation has to do [6265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6265.389s)

with the rivalrous nature of ego so like when you talk about falling out of it the fact that we exist within a macro economy where we have private balance sheets and our balance sheets are rivalrous meaning i can advance mine by ripping your stuff off and vice versa we have we have structural basis for rivalry because they involved in a rivalrous context we have to change that so there's like not just a new [[sensemaking]] and culture and experience but also new infrastructure and new [[social structure|social structures]] probably beyond the scope of what we'll get to today but even we take the balance sheet away there's the like is someone wanting to take up more space in the jam session because of unmet identity needs and do they actually care about the felt [6315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6315.55s)

experience of somebody else who's seeking to express something and we actually feel do we actually feel each other and are we coming from enough wholeness that i'm not relating out of need most of the time yeah yeah and musicians call that cutting right like it like if somebody deliberately out plays the other person and leaves that and leaves their contribution diminished [6337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6337.389s)

versus accretive yeah right there's a cutting sessions and that's bad for yeah yeah yeah so notice you know if we switch this domain i'm thinking about the folks in this side of the camera so let's take this and make this practical in the context of [[sensemaking]] in the world we live in right now almost everything that we're talking about if you apply it one of the things that you [6359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6359.17s)

notice of course is that all the stuff that typically goes under the heading of [[sensemaking]] is worse than useless so any newspaper any news program pretty much every scientific paper to be perfectly frank you know we've done that analysis isn't taking a look at how a few of them are replicable and how much of an incentive structure there is for actually lying to be able [6381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6381.76s)

to generate local selective advantage at least misinterpreting yeah or overstating or whatever it's yeah it's a mess so game a has a [[sensemaking]] architecture broadly speaking waste of time well that opens up some very interesting challenges alright and this goes back to the notion of game be being immature infantile no zygotic haha [6410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6410.969s)

but where we are now i would say is holding yourself a feeling of care for everything and then truly act and make sense in the direction of your actual responsibility which i believe has been said more elegantly as what does it think globally act locally just take that seriously like the reality is is that everybody's got plenty of work to do at home and we're [6448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6448.659s)

trying well this what i'm saying what i'm ryan articulating is that to do this thing to come into coherence to play game be there's a lot of work that has to be done in the individual in yourself and then the way to learn how to do coherence is always going to be with people with whom you actually have real relationships not us not some three of us your wife your husband your kids your [6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6469.659s)

parents or at least other human bodies with whom you can actually be in real physical proximity meaning for a meaningful amount of time so that's that's definitely going to be the fabric out of which this thing gets woven it takes time for sure and it takes doing the hard human stuff so you actually have an embodied experience of what it feels like to actually do the hard human [6492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6492.76s)

stuff as opposed to book-learnin on that direction and good instincts and good habits built through long practice and the notion is to say oh chris connect the dots the proposition is if you want to actually resolve problems around immigration in italy honestly not to make yourself feel good or to look good to other people but for real then the path to get there is this path that [6518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6518.92s)

starts here in yourself and moves out in spirals through things that you can actually touch and truly take responsibility for and then always showing up from that center of sovereignty mm-hmm so that feels like hero's journey 101 or dorothy in the wizard of oz right well you're saying hey the way forward into [[game b]] and emergent coherence is to actually come [6546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6546.93s)

all the way back home to the basics of good old-fashioned humanity but in order for me to be able to reanimate and fully live into the basics of good old-fashioned humanity i actually have to have gone on some initiatory transformative journey in order to remember in fact that  __  cow town in kansas is the best place ever and there's no place like home [6574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6574.99s)

nice so you just joined i get it and we're adding those two together it comes clear beautiful yeah yeah that's very nice it's very it's actually odd how simple and like plain things are and of course what's interesting is once you grasp that once it lands you begin to see how the the bigger challenges begin to self resolve there's a point you made that wasn't the main point it was a [6597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6597.16s)

tangent but i think it's super critical so i want to emphasize it which is okay so why can't we trust any of the things that normally look like sense-making well there's a bunch of reasons but basically we learn how to do signaling for intentional [[game theory|game theoretic]] purposes and so rather than just share signal that is true and representative we share signal that will advantage some [6619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6619.54s)

rivalries agenda so most signal ends up being that and one of the things that you were just saying is a consequence of it is that there's an ethic to not  __  up the information ecology right like in the same way that we say don't pollute and most people get pretty comfortable and don't throw your cigarette butt on the ground don't actually dissing form anybody else [6645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6645.09s)

for your own getting ahead or withhold information where you can avoid doing so because you're actually disempowering the [[sensemaking]] of others in the process and to really be tuned into as though as i'm seeking to make sense i want to increase other people's sovereignty in their capacity to make sense so i want to increase the intactness of the information ecology [6668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6668.01s)

they're exposed to rather than decrease it right up to but not beyond the point of boström and those guys info hazards yeah-oh to the degree that someone else has clearly rivalrouss agenda with regard to information then you have to factor that in so far as sharing information with them within decreased sovereignty for lots of people but glue together what daniel said and what you [6696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6696.36s)

just added to what i was saying to the degree which i'm playing this game with complete strangers out in infospace well never meet i'm probably gonna lose i don't have my how much info info playing which game the game of will omega the game of information ecology cuz [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] someone's gonna be a dick she agrees i'm playing with my wife i'm probably gonna have a better life so [6719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6719.97s)

that's the idea yeah it is if you're playing it trying to say okay hold on i'm trying to solve the [[game theory|game theoretic]] problem with complete strangers by telling the truth anybody who had interests chance how to do came through he's gonna say oh you're the one who's actually the dupe we found this up don't be med stuck don't pinhead stark unless you're actually in [6739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6739.86s)

winterfell with your family then be ned stark that's the idea right don't the key is don't go to king's landing . that's the key the sensor to your point though if you're saying hey yeah you know honour information ecology for the enhanced [[sensemaking]] of all - the folks will do the multiplayer polar trap grab the ring capture the flag but in a rain in a realm of infinitely distributable [6768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6768.75s)

digital information aren't we always simultaneously playing both of those games at once without even clear understanding of the which and the when and the who that's when this thing has got to go away unfortunately this sort of the remember i said the inverse is and the current [[sensemaking]] environment i have an expectation that i should simultaneously [6791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6791.26s)

be aware of everything that's going on in the world and a sense of my having responsibility for it you just pointed out the media infrastructure that supports that possibility has a catastrophic collapse around it so bizarrely enough the only way to have a prophylactic sense against that catastrophic collapse which we can double-click on it that's not clear what [6814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6814.42s)

i mean by that is to only have your media infrastructure be driven by direct real relationships so begin with real relationships and proceed from there lots of problems with broadcast but the ability to amplify dangerous and wrong memes and to be able to share without context and without relationship and without connection and without relevancy and without being able to speak into the [6844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6844.69s)

capacity for listening and if you just come back to the body for an analogy cells go cancerous the body's dealing with them all the time right you'll you only get cancer if the body can't deal with it but imagine if a single cell had the ability to broadcast its message to every other cell simultaneously and it didn't have to go through propagation through the cells surrounding it and [6867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6867.07s)

those types of things like we'd be  __  instantly we the kind of key thing that's helpful is that each cell is being modulated by the cells near in to come back in to check and so there's error correction processes okay so let's unpack that because so for sure you said hey think globally act locally but that  __  doesn't scale fast at all you talk about developmental processes [6888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6888.64s)

patience that stuff doesn't meet timelines and then we discussed the notion of the moment you go to some form of politics of suspicion effectively right and and the idea that there's esoteric exoteric you the secret with an inner sanctums outer sanctums those kind of things i think that's clearly worked in the past for any you know ultimately infinitely [6915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6915.76s)

potent linear traditions and the kind of those sort of things there's there with its filters and gates of who had access to the information in our unique contemporary situation taking the example like sasha shogun right so the chemists who you know re popularized mdma created a lot of you know design or molecules compounds and [[psychedelics]] and then was collaborating with the dea and [6940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6940.75s)

then when the dea looked like they were going to be shutting down and repressing that information published his two cookbooks where he open sourced i said this big thing about open sourcing versus closed source and he opened source all that information now net positive on the world but if we use him as an example if he went the [[open source]] route now you also ended up with street corner chemists being able to do things they never would have anila do without his two books published you also ended up with the advent and rise of and popular promulgation of psychedelic therapies did sasha do the right thing should that have been kept and cloistered and how does the notion of coz i mean the thesis of stealing fire was the only shot we've [6985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=6985.27s)

got to avoid weaponization commodification or collapse into hedonism and particularly the first two are just better funded better focused they're gonna beat our asses every time is to [[open source]] reliable techniques of self initiation effectively right and ideally in service of coherence faster than efforts to capture it and i don't know whether that's true and i don't [7011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7011.64s)

even know whether that's wise but that was the best  __  idea i had at the time so like what did we think about that because you could say just dump it all out there publish it let the chips fall and hope that the rebel alliance right somehow hangs on to the plans for the death star ahead of the instead of the empire building even better desktop what i was thinking as you're saying [7033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7033.18s)

that was lou tick she's dead metaphor while the stuff was going through me as you were as you were talking and one of the things that came to me was i feel reasonably confident that there are in fact things that are appropriate to being [[open source]] we actually mentioned one earlier discernment so discernment is the sort of thing that is somehow now just uncapturable it's anti [7056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7056.73s)

capturable so two degree to which somebody actually goes to the process of building their discernment they are in fact more likely to become an ally than they would otherwise have been for example and so the rebel alliance shouldn't be building or outsourced in our open sourcing plans on building death star's they should be building an open sourcing plans on how to build a [7082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7082.89s)

rebel alliance so that if the import what about lightsabers hold on it's just so if the empire gets a hold of the plans all that happens is the empire becomes more rebel alliance unless empire so not lightsabers not lightsabers this is this is actually really tricky topic one relevant concept is the concept of safe to fail probes and so in you were [7106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7106.08s)

mentioning earlier that the people who went into the arctic like probably most of them failed and then some small set figured out how to make it and then those are the ones that figured it out right so and the same with the jazz riff where it's mostly gibberish but some beautiful thing comes evolution it has a very high fail rate but it's exploring a wide search space and then the things [7132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7132.06s)

that make it through are awesome right and one of the things you're asking about timing is can we do an [[evolutionary process]] factoring the time that we have and can we keep allowing failure with exponential failure possibilities and so the cdc open sourcing everything that it knows about [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] would be stupid because on one hand you could say well it's cool [7156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7156.6s)

that they're open sourcing the knowledge so more people can work on protecting against it except you actually have more capacity for that knowledge to be harmful than to be beneficial and with [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] or with anything that can be weaponized at that scope with ai with nanotech with you really have different considerations because you can't really control safe to [7176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7176.23s)

fail probes and say so say that again like justjust phrase that a different way if the worst thing that can happen is your jam isn't that good like that's not that bad it's a bummer and you the next thing you have a better jam if the worst thing that happens is you release a autopoietic pattern replicator that kills all life you can't  __  around [7198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7198.83s)

with like playing with that thing and so you you actually have to be much more careful that if anyone is exploring how to create antifragility to that knowledge that should be held carefully okay great so labeled so how do we say hey let's just imagine that we have with a little bit of thinking let's say we could woodshed you could fund you know whatever 24 rad and mcarthur level super [7223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7223.1s)

smart folks to come together and come up with protocols for group coherence that work more often than not do we [[open source]] that or are we more concern that it can also build the borg well if i double-click on the content of that the answer is it we [[open source]] that but that's because there's no such thing underneath it the do such thing which has protocols for group coherence [7255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7255.8s)

there's more along the lines of remember it's we were trying to cultivate insight not teach so it's there's a way to generate a in individual humans the ins the embodied insight to be able to in themselves build a capacity to come into coherence that then does actually come into coherence so if you were to be able to again the sermon ism is the canonical point the [[open source]] determine great [[open source]] practices and techniques that work in the directionality of improving discernment at the individual level but i want to go back to something you said earlier because i think this ends up being quite key you mentioned something that about the like the path of relationality doesn't scale well for me with the addition of how a [7311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7311.78s)

supersaturated solution does it phase transition to crystallization that i think is the answer if you actually do this thing where what your your field effect which is to say your [[open source]] broadcast is bringing more and more people into a poised state where their ability to move into coherence is becoming easier and easier and easier then when as up happening is that a [7333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7333.13s)

small amount that actually does drop into coherence creates a crystallization phase transition that could actually scale extremely rapidly and has the characteristic of being very strong and very precise because it's starting on a basis that has no compromise yeah i think we're actually i mean it depends on how we're defining coherence and what you're what you're perceiving as initial [7369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7369.65s)

conditions okay and your question about states and stages basically because it feels like you're emphasizing a stage based argument which is that it's slow it's hard work and you have to really grow and develop into the person that can stay really hold coherence and i think what i find notice what i'm tracking i'm like yeah absolutely that's the foundational level the springboard [7390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7390.74s)

from which you leap and obviously the higher that is the less hops you gotta have right to get to the level of coherence and between you know smart tech pharmaceuticals you know lineage practices like there's enough out there these days that you can for sure create at least you know like the vomit comment you can create moments where everybody is weightless you can [7419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7419.87s)

create a a transient group coherence that and there's it's a bell curve distribution from what i can tell 10% of the people lose their  __  don't know what to do with that space or you know in maybe it's like 10 it could be more but like to say tails you got you got the people who and lose their  __  and then you got the people it doesn't budge at all and those [7442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7442.79s)

are the psychopaths and they should not have been exposed to this and then there's the bell curve in the middle who were like oh wow you know the omega principle like oh wow i'm an organism i'm in here i'm an ai holy  __  we're seeing in parallax this is joyful wondrous amazing transformative and so what do we do with that i'd like to enter topic we haven't [7470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7470.69s)

talked about yet which is the what trust is to coherence it was mentioned earlier not defecting and so one model that i just used personally for trust is i trust people as much as i trust them in their worst states yeah yeah because if there's a bell curve distribution on the states of behavior they're gonna go into maybe which is for most people pretty coupled to their emotional states [7508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7508.58s)

unfortunately right i want to uncouple those so that even if someone's in a shitty emotional state they don't behave shittily that they can witness it and not act on it right like i'm in the fetal position right now no smashing and crashing things right and then i want to help what makes them go into the shittiest emotional states which is trauma and [[meaning making]] patterns i want to help heal that right so they don't go into a shitty states as often but then also decouple their internal state from their behavior but if if someone mmm sometimes takes information i share with them and uses it in really synergistic ways and generally it is at least discerning but when they're pissed off uses it as a weapon against me but that happens well i can't share certain things with them right so there is raising the floor of the shittiest behavior you allow of yourself in relationship that makes you more trustworthy that is actually really at the heart of our ability to have anti fragile coherence that says you know what no matter how upset with you i am there are certain  __  of things i'm just never going to [7575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7575.85s)

do as my own standard for myself and then part of our discernment is to also be able to pay attention to where someone is not just in their highest states after the state induction methods you're talking about but where they are in the shitty parts and one of the things i'm really interested in is not just making people's highest state's higher well what brings them into their [7595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7595.29s)

shittiest states is still anchored and now they they actually have a wider space to reconcile and they can even get bipolar about it it happens a lot yeah i want to help clean this stuff up for sure and it's recursive i was landing there as well i was thinking okay so state and stage obviously for me the first thing that comes up in terms of state is there's the constant recurrence [7618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7618.36s)

of the trap of taking the state for the stage all right so let's carefully partition them and say okay they're not and to the degree to which you've gone to burn him in and take taking drugs you are not in fact actually else anywhere but maybe you saw michael imps that there is somewhere else to go that's neat so very carefully so the first is big [7635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7635.85s)

red flag state is not staged the state is not going to get you to stage by itself take it slow okay so then what happens in state and as i was kind of just again for some first-person experience well a lot of the stuff that we were talking about in terms of what given individual has to actually be able to come into to be able to start participating in a direct collaboration [7660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7660.48s)

and getting to stage in my experience actually happened in states i you want to try to heal trauma trauma healing can happen very well with say [[psychedelics]] [[art]] of transparent mind really really effectively supported by certain kinds of ecstatic states so there's a lot of things i think i think if you actually take the state and think of it as an instrument they can be pointed at [7683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7683.64s)

particular capacities that can be moved into stage because or through the use of that so how do i use a particular state experience to actually develop men to the level up a stage in my [[personal development]] and just have iterations there then i think we're good then i think it works very nicely but we know where the center is here we want to develop mature human [7706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7706.05s)

beings and there are many many different state experiences that are part of the process of doing that many of which we have to use now because our developmental environment so  __  us up that we're gonna have to use some pretty interesting tools to break stuff out yeah absolutely i mean that would be my sense as well it's just that they are it is a [7725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7725.55s)

beautiful thing that a peak state that creates safety security connection insight belonging can lend itself very strongly to to be the fuel source for deep anything we see this with mdma ptsd therapy and a bunch of other things but it basically allows you to go back and reformat and reintegrate places that are currently wounded or traumatized and that we do that in relationship with [7753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7753.09s)

others tightens trust tightens bonds and then further creates the capacity for us to learn to play well with each other through all those stages which you know surfacer if we can learn to share states well with each other and experience momentary coherence momentary transpersonal [[sensemaking]] and be in in the in the mud with each other supporting each other you know that in [7783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7783.38s)

the the linkage between those two is the community oz is like you know to me it feels like this you know nothing new under the sun kind of  __  but like if you think of like gospel churches you know coming out of the african american slave experience it's like there's that sense of they are perfectly designed you know vehicles for a lot of this which is you sway you impact you do you guys [7805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7805.26s)

sealant that the trailer for the new aretha franklin amazing grace so it's like this she did this ripping album called amazing grace in a watts gospel church in like 1974 and then all the footage was lost and it's just come out like i literally wept seeing this this  __  trailer was unreal and she starts [[singing]] the song amazing grace and she just takes that a and she just [7824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7824.85s)

does her she goes all over the she's like 29 years old at the time and but but the gospel choir who's backing her up are like giving it up like they're feeling the shimmy shakes they're feeling the juice they're giving it up for and then they stop praising and testify like the whole thing just goes through the roof and you're like oh my god and [7841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7841.8s)

then there's the swaying the clapping the dancing the movement and you're like it is weeping for the humanity of our wounding it is praising you know the divinity of our possibility and it's connecting like literally like church as a vote and you're like ah  __  man we got it you know we see the dust that  __  off and like create new versions i mean when you imagine the gospel church [7865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7865.44s)

one of the things that makes it so powerful is that you're also noticing it is in continuity with a bigger context it's actually part of a real community right and so it's not like you teleport to the gospel church and then you all fly back to your different cities you walk out and then you go live with each other and it contains the whole of humanity it's got little kids and [7888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7888.15s)

grandmas it's got grandpas it's got the whole human family in a single place so it's kind of like a heuristic if your state experience is you and a bunch of other 20-something rich white people it's probably not right something's probably off about that there's something gonna be missing if it contains the whole of humanity turistic right not ideology heuristic this you [7907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7907.889s)

know it's a and you know across different a whole community if it's continuity if the group is spontaneously getting together in bali and then everybody's flying back to their west coast east coast flyover cities again probably not gonna get the thing done if on the other hand you're already living in community and the state experiences supporting a [7931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7931.619s)

deeper communitas that is lived 24/7 okay that's more likely to work so it sounds like you're adding state stage in place enduring enduring continuity wholeness all right think of it think of it as part of a whole continuous process and then of course what happens is you get all kinds of interesting stuff because now you know one of the things as your particulars you're talking is [7953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7953.849s)

likely this really interesting thing like okay what are the failure conditions in the efforts to go here again like where does it fail and one of the ones was really interesting is like the difference between makalah gluing together analytics and true synthesis so gluing together analytics is this thing we're like okay i've got one piece trans paramedic of mine i've got another [7973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7973.559s)

pieces that i've worked really really good in my [[yoga]] practice to be able to feel peaceful i got another piece where i've taken a whole lot of drugs to get this a bunch of people so we really feel close and we work some stuff out of her over ayahuasca and then i'm gonna do is kind of like put these in the same space and pretend that by sticking them together really hard i've actually [7991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=7991.26s)

achieved some new synthesis in fact what i have is i have three distinct things that aren't actually actually integrated so it's the difference between a puzzle and a photograph or even a puzzle and a real piece of reality and i think we're into this a lot it's almost like the group equivalent of spiritual bypass which is that we can arbitrarily generate a simulation of eating each of [8012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8012.229s)

the artifacts of coherence and we can do so so consistently and so effective with it we really do think we've actually achieved coherence like do you feel it yeah i feel it me do you have transparent mind i'm got it no problem like every piece every piece that you can identify you can show and yet it's not the whole thing because it's actually not integrated into a [8029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8029.389s)

continuous wholeness so that i think is something to be very careful about is that you can't stitch it together it actually is coming from the direction of is this actually part of an integrated wholeness with these heuristics you know do i notice that there's a whole of the human family the whole human tribe a community a real community is the state experience connected on both sides with [8047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8047.959s)

living this that kind of stuff like i think there's a lot of really good stuff that can be done using those heuristics and preventing the failure conditions unless that hope your grandmother like does it grill corn does it grow corn right can it produce children who grow up to be good kids right that kind of stuff and of course the point there is that because that gives you a check [8069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8069.05s)

something you know if you're evolving in a simulation of coherence but you can't actually resolve just basic stuff in yourself but you can always just teleport back to new york and have your basic stuff nobody notices anybody can fake it from 60 days but if you actually have to raise children together okay reality is going to tell you whether they actually deliver on the thing yeah [8090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8090.469s)

there's a grow corn hope you grandmother nice i'm stealing that oh they say one of the interesting things in a world where the market has subsumed almost everything is the difference between production and extraction has become unclear most places and so someone can do well financially without actually growing any real corn by manipulating markets by [8115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8115.559s)

manipulating marketing financial services are mostly that type of phenomena marketing is mostly that type of phenomena and so someone can have a false sense of being a success that their ideas work because they're financially successful though they have been net in tropic to the world their work has actually been net entropic that's actually that whole notion you've [8136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8136.88s)

been describing you've shared that with me recently i've been thinking it ever since you first said it but the idea that wisdom has been subject to kind of i don't know what the exact phrase you use like captured by the market yeah can you speak more than that because i mean obviously you're talking you were talking about discernment and you're saying hey if you want to show it and be [8153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8153.63s)

a good person and just that right trust the omega principle but not everybody else is playing that you're undone yeah and then you've been thinking through even the signifiers of wisdom they're available which would hopefully increase people's discernment how gone tits up i mean jordan mentioned earlier when he's talking about take a teaching from jesus or from anyone and then see what game a [8180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8180.329s)

does within it when it becomes like how the teachings of the guy who emphasized forgiveness became the basis of the crusades and the inquisition is like a really great example like how the  __  did we figure out how to do that and so there's still a similar thing that happens when if someone makes their living by sharing wisdom and they're able to split test optimize the nature [8207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8207.45s)

of what wisdom people respond to the most and what persona expressions and they can click optimize and they can even just allow facebook's algorithms to click optimize the version of wisdom expression that it lands the most you get a capture of wisdom by rivals games and this is the kind of  __  we have to be like really honest with each other about and honest with ourselves about to [8231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8231.899s)

create an information ecology that doesn't have disinformation  __  in it because right now like if true information about reality is a source of competitive advantage within rivalrous games and i both want to withhold true information and i want to dis inform and i want to miss signal you slow down there say all that again because that last two senses this felt [8254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8254.17s)

like important if true information about the nature of reality is a source of competitive advantage in a rival wrist game i know where the water is and you don't but if you go toward the water hole is you'll  __  it up for me or whatever it is then i want to not tell you where the water hole is i also want to dis inform you and tell you that it's somewhere else so you [8273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8273.849s)

don't accidentally find it i also want to maybe exaggerate the specialness of my knowledge so that i become the only bearer of water or whatever it is right so we have insu not not back to you but just to some other potential consumers right right so your this is potentially like rival ris supposed wisdom keepers against each other i mean there's the kind of unwashed masses to which we flog [8297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8297.76s)

 __  and it doesn't even have to be that conscious and intentional right it simply happens in the nature of i want to get this message out there well this version of it is more acceptable and it gets out there better and right so then there's this kind of [[multipolar trap]] degeneration of the content to be susceptible to broadcasts and susceptible to mainstream ability of [8321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8321.159s)

premature focus on scaling in which case split tested analytics and and then what that means is i'm compelling people to listen which is the opposite of supporting their sovereignty i'm actually figuring out causal psychological manipulations to manipulate their choice to do the thing i want them to do rather than try and support the sovereignty of their choice [8339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8339.429s)

making yeah it's a pain in the ass but we have to like every single time we go to the like when you think about these kinds of problems you at least for me i keep coming back to the same basic place so obvious is a prophylactic against this entire thing is just you know broadcast my and as soon as wisdom is in fact just lived relationally it's why that's why landmark is bigger than the [8362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8362.229s)

pasta right i mean they've gone they've gone they've diluted to the lowest common denominator they've made no bones about putting people exposed vulnerable states and upselling and living  __  up yeah it is transactional yeah there's gonna be problems if it's broadcast there's gonna be problems i just have to speak to it irony of us talking about this on [8381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8381.36s)

broadcast fortunately three white men specifically within about roughly the same age i think we're actually the same person well i think the beauty of what's happening though is that it's so unlikely that anybody's actually going to watch this video because it's so incomprehensible and just hard to follow that it's it's actually not a problem [8398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8398.431s)

the with tinchy answer is kind of thinking about that in terms of like the meta is to degree to which this is actually interesting at all what i would say is that this is genuinely just a conversation this is i mean for those who happen to be watching this is straight-up just exactly what a conversation as  __  up as that is what we talk about and this is no [8424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8424.101s)

different as far as i can tell i mean i've had conversations are both of you in some conversations the three of us together i mean me a little bit more formal but not a lot i think was a slower start up like we cut it there was a little bit of that's right we didn't jump into it but this is more or less just water conversation with us is like so but your point i think is quite quite [8447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8447.811s)

nice okay cool so what do we do heuristics like how do we actually prevent this from creating unintended negative consequences so here's something i wanted to enter in that i didn't yet and this was coming in it from a completely oblique direction of anything we've talked about so far but it has to do with what the motive for us doing any of it is for doing any doing [8469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8469.95s)

actually and so it has to do with the nature of desire and this is something i i find really fascinating if you look at the beginning of if you look at buddha's noble truths and desire as the source of all suffering and as kind of a essential eastern teaching and then you look at desire as the cause of passion and creativity in western teaching there's a really big dialectic between those [8500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8500.82s)

that's kind of worth navigating and there's some deep ontology as to why and why i model those differences and so in a western model made in the image and likeness of the creator be creative and desire is the source of the imagined more beautiful rich future for us to be creative right eastern model it has us disconnect from the fullness of the moment to imagine [8526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8526.22s)

that a future moment could be more full and it actually makes us feverish and  __  up and then when we get it we're only happy for like a moment and then we want something else eastern model focused on being which happens in the moment western model has a model of time that is reified focused on doing and becoming which is fulfilled in the future and so of course i'm only [8545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8545.899s)

happy for a moment that i want something else because becoming is actually what's relevant becoming more and more full one way i think about this is if i think about desire as like voltage right like a pressure or a gradient for flow a basis for movement i can think about the low gradient inside of me in the high gradient in the world some some lack or emptiness and myself that creates a [8571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8571.16s)

desire to get something from the world get recognition get money get sex get attention get something right and i think that buddha was right to say that that is the cause of or at least related with suffering and it's kind of like to the degree that i am affirming a sense of self that is in lack i get more of that sense of self to those who have more shall be given to those who don't [8600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8600.189s)

have the little they have shall be taken away biblical quote but we're having is like a state of experience a state of consciousness so then there is a different kind of desire that is not just no orientation for movement which is an inner fullness that actually has a imperative to flow into the world so there is a desire and there's a basis but it's actually coming from wholeness [8623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8623.06s)

not from unholiness is that molly bob marley like my cup overfloweth and i don't know what to do yeah how fez this poem i become this beggar has become so rich that my biggest problem that was empty my emerald filled pockets into the world quickly enough and so there's if i'm coming from that place in the jam session i can totally just let you jam if you're in a meaningful place if i am coming from the other place and i need to be seen then i'm going to cut you off to make sure that i get seen or make sure that my lick was the best or something like that and this is where the identities that are still seeking more and then can feel less in comparison to each other is the basis of rivalry that [8670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8670.46s)

creates the fragility of the coherence mm-hmm yeah it's such an interesting thing like the yeah i agree with you that that teaching is which is say useful and works that there's a way to actually recognize that you are capable of being full with simply yourself there's no need to have something from the outside to fulfill but rather through doing something in self and then [8698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8698.39s)

when you're in that place ah this is actually very similar to what you were talking about when you talked about the the least city to the most to the when there is a high low there's actually okay a way of developing self so as to be able to even when the interior the self is actually lacking in some way still to relate to that as full because the reality is is you don't actually [8728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8728.479s)

need that much very very little really minuscule amount really particularly in contemporary environment and so there's a disposition that can be achieved which is nice like there's a disposition that allows you to then be in a relationship where that gradient form desire is not have much traction it does not pull for me at least i can constantly feel it there's a pole but does not have much [8752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8752.109s)

pull and i should mention by the way for me at least the training has also been having a noticing when it's going to build i'm thirsty now okay well i better take care of that that actually is something that needs to be an actual conscious choice to satisfy i need now this is the thing with your focus on sovereignty and starting at home that is so critical is [8773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8773.54s)

because if i'm not tending to my own wholeness i i actually can't do any of the stuff we're talking about right exactly and then and then what happens is in my experiences that is that every human being i've ever encountered is a cup overflowing provided we're resourced right so my sense would be is that is that you were describing some element of like well if you're buddha writing [8799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8799.25s)

you're completely understanding and you're purely coming from being you've integrated that relation the constant you know dialectic between being and becoming then that's how you play the game but like you were talking about culture architecture and how do we actually get humans in culture and in game a with all the traumas of life how are we helping us you know walk each [8819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8819.53s)

other home then i just keep coming back to that ocean notion of you know that gospel church which is the idea like if we can have momentary provisional transient experiences of coherence right church you know the holy ghost feeling right and we can use that as metronome oh yes i was off the one and now i'm back on the one right i remember and a tuning fork oh i was banged and [8848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8848.84s)

scraped this week but man i'm just like you know i've sweat my prayers i've done whatever i've done and then training wheels now i'd like mdma therapy right now i feel resourced i feel love i feel connection i feel coherence and now let me go and it might lost me the next hour it might lost me all a sunday it might lost me to hump day who the hell knows but i get a little further each time [8874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8874.971s)

practicing so rather than just we got to do a whole bunch of hard slow grooming up to develop to the place where we might finally get to start practicing can we do these in parallel type of gig and a:hover talks about that like well which is it you know the tops down bottoms up gross you know anything it's both because that's how life happens and if but if we [8893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8893.15s)

and i'd feels to me like the peace that socially we're missing the most these days to your point about bali and but you know transformational culture is that people that really good at the atom bomb peak experiences these days they can blow  __  up sky-high their  __  they're terrible at the other 360 days of you the simple stuff yeah and right sleep right you know like at a daily [8916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8916.109s)

practice and like even like a revival a meditate corrective sabbath elective that tone the bell yeah yeah i've actually i noticed it's such an odd thing for me is that i grew up in in texas in the 70s so where prayer at mealtimes was actually very commonplace but my family didn't practice that so i had this experience of like what the heck is that and this was when move into [8938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8938.64s)

secularism and even the new atheism was becoming part of the cultural fabric so as would is that and also a little bit of like that's not cool alright and as i got older that actually kind of disappeared but i've actually noticed over the past what maybe even four years i've actually been to build a prayer and mealtime practice myself but from the inside out meaning that it's not formal [8960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8960.029s)

it's not imposed i'm not like we're just reciting a script that i've learned i haven't learned it rather i had an insight which was oh well there's a lot of basic practices like feeling deep gratitude that are crucial and you always have to eat yeah so i would always forget to have my gratitude practice but when i said you know what i'm gonna do this before i eat i'm gonna [8985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=8985.529s)

do my gratitude practice i'm just gonna bind something that just has this really cool characteristic of being really hard to forget ie eating with something that's really useful and has a little bit of cultural vectren just combine the two and then it just began to expand from there so this is of course the recreation of ritual it is also part of the story yeah and [9005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9005.479s)

that's a lot of culture hacking we can do right i mean i mean grace gratitude at dinner shabbos you know sabbath day down a down day every week to reflect and reset like these are simple things that are easy to dust off and reanimate and i really think again i think there's a lot that can be open sourced we just have to make sure that we're not open sourcing the technology we're open [9027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9027.979s)

sourcing the technology to and bring into insight so don't [[open source]] the info [[open source]] things that build developmental capacity the generative process led tampa so when you said you didn't come back to prayer because you were deciding to adopt the tradition but you discovered that that made sense yeah and earlier you're talking about [9054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9054.631s)

education that is not teaching info but that is facilitating epiphany yeah when someone has real epiphany and they figure out something that's useful and then they teach other people and the other people don't understand why and that happens a few generations the dharma becomes dogma right like the thing that that had real wisdom just becomes a thing to do because the [9075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9075.631s)

authorities told us and then liberation actually looks like rebelling against it and even if we're submitting to it we don't really get the gist and so to not have dharma become dogma and become a control system it has to be alive and real and rediscovered for everyone and that's a different process than an emetic transmission exactly the medic transmission well what about a catalytic [9096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9096.45s)

mimetic because that has to be a lot of good syllables doesn't it sound like no truly i mean what would to your point about your you're giving your to your disclosing and the protocols for self disclosure that that could arguably be a catalytic them principles more than protocols mmm-hmm yeah yeah no more i mean i'm interested like we're even a mythopoetic catalytic mimetic so what is [9121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9121.83s)

the story of how we begin to remember and it's going to have to be again more in the direction of poetry or the parable of how we begin to remember so that it's hinting to people in themselves moments in their lives but they have in fact come across stumbled across or opened into beginning to remember such that they can find in themselves the thread that is there is [9150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9150.631s)

that they can begin to follow with greater clarity mmm-hmm yes and then i can testify by the fruits right and then we have to be very mindful of the fact that you this is what the twelfth done we've kind of gone through this cycle on who's counting which we got the axial age we had the christian islamic era we had you know we have a series of points where there's like okay guys [9178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9178.8s)

here's a whole new level up you know somebody has an epiphany they have a real epiphany it's for real and they're like all right this time it's not turning to dogma guys let's get it right the trick of course here is that we kind of have to okay so this comes to what you were saying earlier that i wanted to comment on i'm gonna say something that will sound like really inspiring or [9201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9201.84s)

depressing or ridiculous i'll go with ridiculous go so i'm gonna speak mythopoetic ly about the space that we read we've talked about it like this before is that [[exponential tech]] the technology extends the power of our choice making and but our we have tools that give us the ability to make better tools that give us the ability to make better tools so we have an [[exponential curve]] it's just been very slow and now it's not very slow now it's in the very quickly compounding place and so we're getting exponentially larger levers on our choices but we're not getting exponentially better choice making and so we are getting the power of gods without getting the love or wisdom of gods to wield that power that's a self-determination scenario i don't see [9248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9248.91s)

any scenario where we don't get the power of gods that seems eminent and unavoidable and so they're really like there really is this enlightenment or bust thing that i see which is if we have catastrophic level tech not just isolated two state actors but they can be radically decentralized who gets to be totally  __  up nobody or even not be very omni considerate to can do [9279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9279.391s)

catastrophic stuff on accident so this is like the existential bodhisattva yes it is this is the bodhisattva imperative actually has to become universal for us to make it through this phase and that wasn't true in the bronze age or stone age or iron age the other ages because we could just kill a lot of people we could destroy a lot of environments and we did now it's [9299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9299.13s)

just kill everybody in all environment right so let's then jump back to the story i was trying to tell earlier quite poorly so zone of proximal development we've all got that notion right that there's a place we could get to now let's think about them the level up from homo habilis to homo sapiens and the many many different things that all had to come together simultaneously for that [9321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9321.689s)

zone of proximal development tool and you had to have yet yatta knee and grandmothers and fathers and the emergence of the capacity for language and a certain affinity to not beat the  __  out of other males as soon as you can counter like a whole bunch of stuff each one of which independently isn't necessary particularly useful and any one of which is lacking it the thing [9343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9343.02s)

doesn't hold together very well right so you've got a bunch of like little micro versions and if they don't that don't work and they fall apart until eventually get to the zone of proximal development and then pop it kind of pops together i was thinking about that in terms of ok we've we're in this place for all right we're making another run at it we're trying to get we're trying [9361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9361.199s)

to get to this spot and the question is well was what are the pieces what are the pieces of the puzzle and i was really interested in like noticing that we've got a whole bunch and they come from lots of different places you know you mentioned the quakers and the sioux and we've talked about like buddhism has stuff like non-attachment like one of the interesting traps for [9380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9380.22s)

example i was thinking through in terms of like okay if i had an epiphany and i want to share it and it turns to dogma one of the reasons when in terms of dogma is attachment i want people i'm attached to the good word and so some interesting things about okay what's the toolkit what are the pieces of this next stage that if they come together they mutually support each other like the mat [9405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9405.3s)

that when people stand in a circle they all kind of like turn and they begin to sit down simultaneously we're just perfectly as you begin to lose your balance you sit and you land on somebody else's knees and it goes all the way around the whole circle like what's that thing where all the pieces come together and the stage now has the elements that support each other so we [9422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9422.58s)

actually have reached a new place and what i notice is this this really interesting thing where like if i applied non-attachment and humility by the way which are really interesting cross products if they're coming from very different latin lineages and they reinforce each other quite nice so say them again non-attachment and humility in the [9441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9441.3s)

context of urgency and in the context by the way of we've done a lot of conversations about the if you really really think clearly about the circumstances that we find ourselves in even just the simple construction daniel did of as you're becoming more and more powerful as you become unlike and to god in the direction of destructive capacity if there's not an equivalent like unto [9466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9466.439s)

god then in level of wisdom and care you're likely gonna  __  things up real quick and we've been through this many many times there's every construction you go through leads to the fact that we really don't have that much leeway we don't have that much time and the number of paths that are not in fact catastrophic are extremely narrow okay well hold that that's true [9490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9490.59s)

hold that hold the energy and the degree to which that creates a motivational push to cause you to just do stuff that is hard at the same time have both humility and non-attachment yeah those the and committed at a level of intensity that's like way up there and not attached like that's the stuff that moves you to this point this singularity where the pop happens and the stage [9515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9515.96s)

settles in yeah this is the being doing dialectic being grounded in a being that is actually full means unattached to needing fullness from the doing achieving a particular thing and yet like a way i think about it is there's a fullness of what is but i stopped thinking about reality as a noun and think about it as more verb like i can have a fullness with what is and they [9547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9547.47s)

can also recognize an evolutionary trajectory i can recognize the beauty of life and be nourished by it and i can also know that it's mine to add to the beauty of life as best i can and that's being appreciating the beauty of life doing adding to the beauty of life becoming increasing our capacity to be and do at greater depth rebel wisdom is a new [[sensemaking]] platform bringing together the most rebellious and inspiring thinkers from around the world if you're enjoying our content then you can help us make more by becoming a subscriber which will give you access to a load of exclusive films also you can then join our group zoom calls to discuss the ideas in the films and you can send us ideas for questions for upcoming interviews we're also [9598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es_WTEgZHE&t=9598.009s)
