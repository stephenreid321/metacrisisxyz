welcome to future thinkers podcast episode number 57 one of our favorite guests daniel rotten burger from neuro hacker collective is back on the show today daniel is talking about a concept which she calls the [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[existential risk|existential risks]] so these are the deep causes from which the [[existential risk|existential risks]] we face today come from this interview is in three parts that should be listened to in chronological order to [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=22.71s)

get the full understanding of the concept in part one daniel explains what [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[existential risk|existential risks]] are and how they affect the world in part two and three he elaborates on the [[generator function|generator functions]] through a few different lenses and reflects on what we need to do to solve these underlying issues to listen to all three parts and get all the links in show notes go to [41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=41.52s)

about how to assess and prevent [[existential risk|existential risks]] and we got a lot of positive feedback on that episode people really loved it and i know you've spent a lot of time thinking about the subject since then and you've refined your position so i wanted to ask you what is your current thinking on [[existential risk|existential risks]] and how to deal with them alright great very happy to be back with both of [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=143.45s)

you it's valuable for us to kind of go up a level when we're thinking about risks existential or just any kind of [[catastrophic risk]] it's not just a weird fetish topic and it's not just purely there is some risk and we want to survive the deeper topic you know in future thinkers you guys are looking here at the future of economy and the [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=167.15s)

future of sense of making the future of technology the future of healthcare the future of ethics the future of lots of things right and in the presence of [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] that makes possible changing things that we're never possible to change before what is the guiding basis for how we utilize that technological power well and make good choices [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=185.69s)

in the presence of that we've always had a sense that [[human nature]] is a certain thing fix can genetically or at whatever level fix and then we're looking at good behavior you know within that framework and as soon as we're at the level of genetic engineering humans as a real at least [[thought experiment|thought experiments]] could be a real possible technology we could work to genetically engineer all people to be [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=207.5s)

sociopathic hyper computers who didn't feel badly about winning at win-lose games at all and were optimized for it we could work to chip our brains into a eyes that could take us even further in that direction of being able to win those games we could engineer aggression out of ourselves completely and so then we start to say like wow those are really different realities what do we [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=231.53s)

want well we want to win the game why do we want to win there's an assumed game that we're playing against whomever right that some ways some in group is playing against them out group and whether it's us versus russia versus china or it's you know whatever in-group out-group dynamic we say well what happens when you keep playing that in-group out-group game forever [253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=253.67s)

well those games have always caused harm they have a narrow set of metrics that define a win and everything outside of those metrics is externality so when we're playing a win-lose game whether it's personal in person or team on team and whether the team is a tribe or a country or a company or a race or whatever it is right the in-group competing against an out group for some [276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=276.56s)

definition of a win we're directly seeking to harm each other right - cause the lose to each other and we're also indirectly causing harm to the commons which is we're competing for the extraction of scarce resource we are externalizing cost pollution whatever it is to the commons if we're having if we're competing militarily there's a harm that comes from warfare right we're [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=296.12s)

polluting the information ecology through disinformation to be able to maintain the strategic competitive advantage of some information we have so all the risk games necessarily cause harm so if you keep increasing your harm causing capacity with technology and technology that makes better technology it makes better technology so exponentially exponential harm causing [318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=318.979s)

eventually taps out right eventually it exceeds the capacity of the playing field to handle and the level of harm is no longer viable and it's an important thing to think about that when we think about the risks of weaponized drones or crispr bio warfare or any of the like really dreadful things that are very new technologies that we could never do before they're not really different in fundamental type than the things that have always sucked like when we first came out with catapults versus not having those or cannons or whatever it is they're just a lot more powerful of the things that have always sucked and but it's important to get that we have been murdering other people in mass and this thing called war is a reasonable [362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=362.87s)

way to do with a difference were to get ahead for a long time for the whole history of the thing we call civilization and we have been unruh new ibly you know plants out of the ground in terms of agriculture cutting trees or whatever in ways that lead to desertification for thousands of years all the early civilizations that don't exist anymore don't exist anymore [380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=380.15s)

because they actually led to their own self-determination really critical ways so it's not like war an environmental destruction and etc is a new topic it just if a mayans fell or the byzantine or the mesopotamian or the roman even the roman empire fell wasn't everything there was a lot but it wasn't everything but when you have the in-group out-group dynamics keep getting larger tribe two [405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=405.169s)

groups of tribes 2 villages fiefdom kingdom [[nation state]] global economic trading bloc so as to be able to compete with a larger team that you know keeps having the incentives to do those with larger weaponry extraction tech externalization text narrative tech information this information tech you get to a point where you have like we have today [428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=428.72s)

it completely globally interconnected [[supply chain]] and globally interconnected civilization dynamics because of scale where the collapse ends up being really collapsed of everything and the level of warfare possible can actually make a non habitable biosphere right can actually not just be catastrophic for a local people which previous wars always were a catastrophic for people and so yet that [449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=449.66s)

rivalrous games have always caused behaviors of humans that have sucked but exponential stock is existential as an important way of thinking of it and that means that we have to be different than we have ever been in the history of the thing we call civilization to simply not extinct ourselves because the way we have always been has been a smaller scale of the same thing at this scale is [473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=473.87s)

now extinction airing that's a big deal because it means that the solutions we're looking for do not look like previous best practices because those were practices at how to win win lose games we're winning at win lose games is now the omni lose-lose generator right it is now the thing that we can't keep doing so we don't like to think this deeply about things we like to take [492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=492.95s)

whatever things have been like the good best practices and figure how to like iterate a tiny bit and run with those things except the entire tool set of best practices we have are actually why we're at the brink of a gazillion different x risk scenarios that are the result of using those tool sets and so words like capitalism and science and technology and democracy are [514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=514.44s)

like our favorite words because they give us a lot of redshift they did they also created a heap of problems and problems are now catastrophic in scale where the solutions need to be new stuff now people freaked out because if you say something other than capitalism they think that you mean communism and you want to take their stuff and have the state force everyone to do shitty jobs [533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=533.08s)

and if you say something of the democracy again it's assumed that it's gonna be like some kind of fascists terrible thing and something other than science means i could rest with religion no i want to be very clear that i'm not proposing systems that suck worse than the current systems we have i'm proposing deeper level of insights and deeper level of what we would actually [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=552.07s)

call innovation and novelty then have been on the table so far so for instance democracy you know when churchill said democracy is the single worst form of governance ever created save for all the other forms he was saying something very very deep which is democracy is the best form of government we've ever created and it's terrible but all the other ones are even [572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=572.89s)

worse because the idea of government or governance is this really tricky thing where we're trying to get lots of different humans to cooperate or agree or make choices together and like we just suck at that and he was admitting something very important and true and jefferson said similar things which is we were able to get a lot of people to care about each other to see through [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=595.33s)

each other's perspective to make agreements if it's a tiny number of people and this was tribes the history of tribes hence why they kept out at a very small size was above the size at which you could care about everybody know about what was going on for everybody factored their insights share the same based reality where if you heard anyone you were directly hurting [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=613.81s)

someone that you lived with loved and cared about as soon as you start getting to a size where you can hurt people without knowing it anonymously through some [[supply chain]] action or voting on something whatever it starts to become a totally different reality right anonymous people when we're willing to give up some freedoms for people we to depend on and care about and have [631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=631.92s)

this close bonding with so but as soon as we get to larger than tribe dynamics we have had a real hard time doing that in any way that doesn't disenfranchise lots of people we have democracy it says okay there's no way everybody's gonna agree on anything but we have to be able to move forward and decide if we make a road or not to go to war and not or whatever it is right so let's come up with a proposition or something to do and let's at least see that more people like it than don't like it at least at least it seems to represent the majority of thinking that seems like a reasonable idea and whether we have a representative or not or it's a 67 percent majority or 51 percent or a voting currency they're all different versions but basically of the same idea [670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=670.26s)

let me explain something about how bad the idea actually is the catastrophic problems that it creates for democracy will stop being like this really wonderful word and it doesn't mean we don't give it it to do for the beautiful place that is served in history it's just it is a place that is in the rearview mirror in terms of if it's continues in the forefront we actually [688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=688.41s)

can't navigate it's not an adequate tool for the types of issues we need to navigate and again remember i'm not going to propose any other system ever proposed proposed the things that don't even sound like governance but that sound like a different method of individual and collective [[sensemaking]] and choice making but mockridge is a process where somebody or somebodies [706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=706.769s)

make a proposition of something right we're gonna build the bridge this way or go to war whatever it is and they make a proposition to benefit something that they're aware of that they care about but they're not aware of everything and they don't care about everything that's connected equally so other people realize hey the thing that you want to do is gonna stuff up that i care [725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=725.76s)

about that bridge that you want to build so that you can get across the river without driving all the way around is gonna kill all the owl's in this area and mess up some fisheries and i care about that that was in the fisheries and other people are like you and the environmental fishery stuff like we need to get to work and what you have now is a basis where if the proposition goes [746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=746.25s)

through it will benefit some things than harm other things and if it doesn't go through the thing that would have been benefited now isn't benefited but the thing that would have been harmed now isn't harmed and so you will get an in group of people that care about the one set more who then banned against the out group of the people who care about the other thing this will always drive polarization and eventually the polarization becomes radicalization and we didn't even try in the process to figure out what a good proposition they might do a better job of meeting everybody's needs was we didn't even try and do a context map of what are all the interconnected issues here what would a good design that everybody might like look like and can [785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=785.35s)

we even try to find a synergistic satisfy that's not even part of the conversation right maybe rather than make the bridge there we could make the bridge a slightly different area and there's no owls there maybe we can move boughs maybe we can use pontoon boats maybe we don't even need to make a bridge because all the transportation go back and forth is for one company and we [805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=805.42s)

can just move the company's headquarters maybe but the [[sensemaking]] to inform the choice making is not a part of the governance process so if i'm making choices blind or mostly blind based on a tiny part of the optics then other people who have other optics are like wait that's not a good choice and right now we both know that if one eye shows something but my other eye shows [827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=827.02s)

something else i want to pay attention to both eyes i don't want them in a [[game theory|game theoretic]] relationship with each other right they do parallax and give me depth perception and my eyes and my ears don't want to make each other the same they actually really want to do different functions but i also want to pay attention to each other because if i hear something and i think that it was [843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=843.58s)

over there i'm gonna go away from it but my eyes tell me it's actually somewhere else like i want to pay attention to all of my [[sensemaking]] so my brain is doing is really interesting process of taking all of this different sensory information putting it together and trying to pay attention all of it to make a choice that's informed by all that sends me we have never been able to [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=857.8s)

think about governance processes like this where we start with how would a group of people that are in our affecting each other that are in or affecting within a particular context as sense-making nodes be able to share their [[sensemaking]] in a way that could create parallax it could actually synthesize into a picture that could create design criteria of what is [881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=881.11s)

actually meaningful good desired etc by everybody that could work towards progressively better synergistic satisfiers that are based less on theory of trade-offs that will always create some benefit at some harm which will lead to some in groups fighting somehow groups to increase seating a power on both sides that will eventually turn into a [900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=900.73s)

catastrophic [[self-terminating]] scenario and you know when we look at it we see that this type of scenario has always led to left/right polarization davinci becomes radicalization that ends in war to stabilize but you can't keep having war with [[exponential tech]] we're non-state actors have existential level tech you just can't keep doing that and so the thing that we've always done we [921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=921.97s)

can't ever do anymore right like this is a big deal but we also are able to think about how do brains put the information from eyes and ears together how do a bunch of neurons come together a neural networks to make sense in a way that none of them individually do can we out of 50 trillion cells as autonomous entities operate in your body in a way that is both good for them as [943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=943.209s)

individuals and good for the whole simultaneously where they are neither operating at their own benefit at the expense of the ones that they depend on nor are they damaging themselves for the other like they are really in a kind of optimized symbiosis because the system depends on them and they depend on the system and that means that they depend on each other and the system in etc can [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=962.47s)

we start to study these things in a different way that gives us novel insights into how to be able to have higher-level organization [[collective intelligence]] collective adaptive capacity collective [[sensemaking]] actuation capacity and the answer is yes we can and we can see that that's not the thing that we've called democracy right the thing that we've called [981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=981.13s)

democracy some process of a proposition based on some very limited [[sensemaking]] with some majority that is always going to lead to polarization that's gonna lead to the group that doesn't get it feeling disenfranchised and then having antipathy against the group as a whole and then you know the warfare that occurs between them of whatever kind with our info warfare or actual warfare [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1000.209s)

and so the reason i bring this up is because like democracy was great compared to just like a terrible fascist dictator right but it definitely is not adequate to the complexity of the problems we have to solve nor can we continue to handle the kinds of polarization and problematic dynamics that inexorably creates the same is true with capitalism the same is true with [1024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1024.9s)

the thing that we call a science and tack which is a probably the hardest one i'll get to that one last so the thing that we call capitalism we all know the positive story there that it in cents people being self responsible and being industrious and seeking to bring better products and services to the market at a better value and those who do will get ahead and they [1043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1043.8s)

should get ahead because they're gonna be good stewards of resource because they got to resource by bringing products and services at a value that people cared about and etc like we know that that story right there's some truth to it like there was some twisted democracy story and it served evolutionary relevance and it most certainly can't take us the next set of [1060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1060.96s)

steps so you know for instance the thing that we call money and ownership you can actually think of it related to governance as a type of choice making process if we don't think about deeply enough the nature of what these types of structures are if i have a bunch of money it means i have concentrated choice making capacity because i can now want to make a choice that i can extend [1084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1084.57s)

through a bunch of employees right i can have a bunch of them working aligned with my [[sensemaking]] on my behalf to increase my actuator capacity or i can get physical resources to be able to build something that extends my actuator capacity and so we recognize oh a system that ends up determining who has resource and then the resource ends up being a way that some people are [1106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1106.47s)

actually directing the choice making of other people is a choice making system and then we say well is that your shitty choice making system because the idea that those who have the money are better choice makers for the whole is just silly right like it's just really silly even if someone did bring good products or services to market effectively that doesn't mean they're kids who inherited [1127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1127.98s)

it and it doesn't mean that i can't make money by extraction rather than production that is net debasing the environment and it doesn't mean that i didn't externalized i figured out how to externalize more harm and cost to the commons than somebody else did which drove my margins up so i got more of it and i didn't mean that i didn't do war profiteering right and so we search [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1146.429s)

whereas okay well that's just actually a shitty choice making system so we stopped even thinking about what is the future of economics in the future of governance because the words are so loaded that we just can't help ourselves but boot bad concepts when we think think of those words so we started thinking about all right as humans are making choices [1164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1164.58s)

individually and in groups based on information that we have towards some things that we value and hope to have happen right so how do we get better on value frameworks what we really seek to benefit how do we get better on our [[sensemaking]] processes and how do we get better on their choice making processes and what is the future of individual and collective value framework [[sensemaking]] choice making processes and that ends up being what obsoletes the things we call economics and governance now now we come back to capitalism for a minute okay so not only is it just not a great choice making system and not only does it end up actually being a pretty pathological choice making system because it's easier to extract than it is to actually produce and it's easier to rip off with [1207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1207.929s)

someone else worked really hard on than it is to work really hard on making thing and it's easier to externalize cost to the commons than not and you know etc but we say ok it's not just that it said we've got 70 trillion dollars worth of economic activity give or take every day trade hands back on what you consider a dollar we're pretty much all of that externalizes harm at [1228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1228.24s)

some point along the [[supply chain]] meaning the physical goods economy required mining and turns it into trash on the other side so the linear [[materials economy]] is disruptive to the environment causes pollution along the whole thing etc causes marketing to be able to drive it that is polluting people's minds with a bunch of manufactured discontent and [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1248.25s)

you know etc drives disinformation of some companies trying to just inform other ones to maintain strategic advantage is running on dollars that are supported by militaries and so you just think about the whole thing like wow ok even the things that i think are good like the just a movement of what those dollars are is externalizing harm in an exponential way that is moving towards [1272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1272.779s)

catastrophic tipping points all right well that can't work and then even worse you say all right let's take a look at facebook for a minute because facebook since last time we talked between russia and cambridge analytic and tristan and etc there's a lot more understanding of the problem of platforms that have a lot of personal data but also have their own agency with respect to you [1296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1296.549s)

and we say okay so facebook wants to maximize time on site because there they make money by selling marketing and the more users are on site more often more they can charge for the marketing so they figure out they used very complex ai analytics split testing etc to see exactly what will make online stickiest for you possible so you happen to so really left out when you see pictures of [1322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1322.02s)

your friends doing without you and that makes you click and look and makes you feel really bad but they optimize the out of that and your feed because it's what you actually stay on and other people it's the [[hypernormal stimuli]] of the girls that are all airbrushed and photoshopped that makes them stay on or the whatever it is but it'll always be a hyper mo stimuli and [1339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1339.42s)

if you think about the way that mcdonald's wanted to make the most addictive or coca-cola or phillips morris if i am on the supply side of supply and demand i want to manufacture artificial demands that want to maximize lifetime value of a customer right lifetime revenue and so if i can make you addicted to my stuff that's the most profitable thing so when [1358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1358.62s)

you look around at a society that has ubiquitous rampant addiction of almost all kinds everywhere you realize that's just good for business that's good for gdp and so we see that facebook is just by its own nature of doing what it's supposed to do public company [[fiduciary responsibility]] to shareholders maximize profit blah blah blah is they're gonna maximize your time on site and [1378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1378.42s)

maximizing your time on site is gonna work better by [[hypernormal stimuli]] that make you addicted and by things that make you sovereign work because you actually realize that your life is better when you get the off facebook and go hang out with real people and so it has to drive addiction and discontent and whatever else and it's really good at a bunch of crafty [1394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1394.11s)

tricks for how to do that and so we see then that corresponding with that is the rise of bulimia and anorexia and and all kinds of body dysmorphia we see that corresponding with it is depression and probability for suicide rates we see that the [[hypernormal stimuli]] of polarizing news grabs people more than like non polarizing news because fights in an [[evolutionary environment]] are really important things to pay attention to they're kind of hyper monel stimuli and so the most polarizing names are gonna show up on youtube videos and get the most traction and you notice whenever there's a debate that's supposed to be a friendly debate you look at the name the youtube video that gets the most shares and it's so-and-so of this rate [1433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1433.41s)

so-and-so right yeah destroys this person yeah and that [[hypernormal stimuli]] grabs us in the basal ganglia and the worst way possible makes the worst versions of us but it maximizes time on site so now you look and you say okay so the net result of facebook is increased radicalization in all directions increased broken sense-making like [1456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1456.05s)

decreased sense-making increased echo chamber and antipathy at a level that will increase both the probability of civil wars and world wars and everything else and the increased teen depression and suicide rates and shopping addictions and you're like wow this is evil right like this is a really terrible thing this facebook want to do that we could almost make up [1478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1478.17s)

a conspiracy theory that it's like facebook has optimized how to make the world wars as fast as possible facebook doesn't want to do that facebook is just trying to make a dollar right and justify to itself that it should continue to exist and it just happens to be that how it makes a dollar has the externality of all that stuff in the same way that when exxon was making [1495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1495.42s)

$1 or when the military-industrial complex or a secure industry that makes money when people are sick and not when they're healthy like okay so look at that right so capitalism is inexorably bound to [[perverse incentive]] everywhere and at an even deeper structural level if we tried to fix that we'd say okay we're competing to own stuff and the moment [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1522.24s)

you own something i no longer have access to it even if you're not using it even if you hardly ever use that whatever it is right drill you don't even remember where you put it i don't have an access to it and as a result and there's a scarce amount of the stuff and the stuff that is more scarce we make more valuable and so then you own it i don't have access to it but because you [1545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1545.31s)

want to be able to provide for your future and whatever and there's uncertainty you want to own all the that you can and pull it out of circulation put it in safes and security boxes so that takes a lot of resource from the earth where everything you own is just bothering me because it's being removed from my possible access so we are in a rival wrist relationship with [1563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1563.64s)

each other because the nature of the good itself is rivalrous because of the ownership dynamic ring and the valuation on scarce things in particular and everybody can say well it makes sense why we'd value scarce things because if there's enough for everybody it's not doesn't have the same type of advantages if there's not enough for everyone so that kind of [1583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1583.8s)

makes sense except the problem of course is if we make decisions based on an economic calculus which we do right the cfo who looks at the numbers and says no this quarter we have to do this and they're only paying attention to the numbers they're paying attention to then if ar isn't worth anything because there's enough of it for everybody and i can't increase my strategic competitive [1602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1602.67s)

advantage over you by hoarding more air then air is worth nothing even though we all die without it literally is valueless to us and our economic calculus so we will pollute the  out of it and burn the out of it phillip felicio to pull the o2 out of it in the oxidizing of hydrocarbons because we don't factor it because it's not scarce and doesn't provide [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1624.57s)

competitive advantage where's the gold on the other hand the gold we will fight wars over will destroy environments and cut down trees to mine it out that we're actually putting the oxygen in the air that we don't give a about so that we can put the gold in a safety deposit box that we don't ever look at and doesn't get to do anything other than be noted on my balance sheet as it's um [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1645.9s)

increased kind of competitive advantage i have over you because if there's not enough for everybody to have it then i get some competitive advantage by having a new table and the value is proportional to that not the real physical asset of what that metal could do which is why the metal is not actually being used in electronics it's being in gold bars and for gone [1661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1661.95s)

somewhere else right this is all insane and of course we see that the moment that we make abundant things worthless even if they're the foundation of life and we make scarce things worth a lot even if they're meaningless then it creates a basis to artificially manufacture scarcity and avoid abundance everywhere if i have something i supply and i make it abundance and all of a [1686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1686.79s)

sudden is worth nothing which is why if i make some software that i could give to the whole world for free once i've made it i just have to make enough money there may be no no i'm gonna patent protect and comes through you if you figure out how to pirate it so that i can keep charging you even though i have no unit costs right i've actually solved the [1704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1704.94s)

scarcity problem and i'm gonna artificially manufacture scarcity to keep driving my a balance sheet of course the kimberly diamond mines burn and crushed their diamonds because we thought diamonds were scarce for me at the price i then we realized they weren't scarce if people had the price i didn't want that to be known and you know etc accelerating so if we want a [1721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1721.049s)

world of abundance for everybody we can actually make it technologically engineer the scarcity out create abundance everywhere is a feasible thing to do we can talk more about that later but you can't in have an incentive on scarcity and engineer it out at the same time right so now they're scarce stuff we're competing for it you own it which means you possess it and you remove my [1740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1740.039s)

capacity for access and so i want to own it faster than you own it and so then i know and now we get into a tragedy of the commons and a [[multipolar trap]] thing to say i go cut down a tree in the forest i don't need that many trees right now but you're in this other tribe and you're gonna go cut down some of the trees i would like there to be a forest rather than a total clear-cut [1762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1762.629s)

environments for store beautiful and they grew up with the forests and i like the animals that are there but i know that if i don't cut down the trees and i leave the trees they're still won't be a forest because you're gonna cut down the trees and since you're gonna cut down the trees and the other guy the other tribe knows that and they know that i'm going to and so we say it i gotta [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1778.59s)

cut down all the trees as fast as i can because if they're gonna be no trees anyways i might as well get them rather than them get them because if they have increased economic power over me they're gonna use those pieces of wood against me and more in an economic competition and for now we all increase the rate of the destruction of the forest as fast as we can even though we'd all like [1797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1797.07s)

a forest because we're caught in a multipolar prisoner's dilemma with no good way out so the tragedy of the commons is a multipolar or trap the [[arms race]] where we say you know what we should just not make weaponized ai we should just not do that that's it everyone in the world thinks that the idea of facial-recognition weaponized ai drones is a world that would be [1819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1819.149s)

better not to live in right like nobody wants live in that world because it doesn't matter how rich or powerful you are you're not safe to a bunch of beds in here is normal but we're all making them like everybody's advancing  tack why are we doing that why don't we just make a treaty not to do it because we make a treaty we secretly know that the other guy's gonna defect [1838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1838.659s)

on it secretly because if he gets the tech first he'll rule the world and he'll beat us and he knows that we're gonna defect on it so either we make the treaty and we all defect on it secretly while agreeing to it publicly well trying to spy on the other guys while trying to dis inform their spies about what we're actually doing or we just don't even agreed with right so [1859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1859.96s)

we move forward towards a world that increases the probability of extinct in all of us every day in this scenario the tragedy of the commons these [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and we'll come back to this i was on capitalism but i'm gonna connect as [[multipolar trap]] so please remind me to do it one of the things we have to solve at a [[generator function]] level is [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] as a category meaning all instances of them categorically because a [[multipolar trap]] basically means where the local optimum for an individual agent if they pursue it leads to the global minimum for the whole right but if i don't make the noobs or the ai or take the tree down i'll get  right now if i do it i don't get  right now but as we all do it we all get worse later right so you [1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1913.84s)

made a scenario where the incentive of the agent short-term locally is directly against the long-term global well-being that is the world writ large right now and capitalism is inexorably connected to that right because it drives these [[rivalrous dynamics]] and rival worse than em extra the basis of [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and so i could just sound depressing except there are actually solutions to [1941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1941.32s)

all of these things there is a basis for how we deal with physical stuff it is not you owning some scarce thing and removing my access we all know examples of it we know that when you go to the shop to the grocery store and you use a shopping cart you don't bring your own shopping cart that you own which would be a major pain in the ass and i don't do that you have access to a cart where [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1962.35s)

there's enough car during peak hours the busiest hours there's enough cards for everybody and enough left over for repairs and so your access to the cart does not decrease my access to cart so i'm not upset that you got a cart we're not in any competition over carts and because i only need enough for there to be enough during peak time which is maybe 200 people only [1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=1982.34s)

need 200 cart learn plenty cart train even though that store might service 10,000 people months so think about 200 carts vs. 10,000 carts how much less resource it is from the environment how much more efficient it is so now you start saying all right well let's look at other places where this thing could happen say well we've owned cars as a good and when you own a car i no longer [2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2005.35s)

have access to it but then you're mostly just gonna leave it sitting and hardly ever use it you'll use it now and again distance been 95 percent of it's like just sitting places and as a result of that there's a lot of cars to not provide that much transportation and that's a lot of metals taken out of the earth and a lot of plastics and a lot of you know actual environmental costs to [2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2026.23s)

be able to make those to have most of them never in use now you start to say okay well we look at car sharing like uber and lyft and whatever and we start moving there from a possession of a good to an access of a service that's pretty cool i'm still gonna pay for it it's still kind of shitty because there's not enough of it to have give me good access everywhere but it's pretty easy to [2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2048.099s)

imagine did that thing takes over right and then you use something like [[blockchain]] to disintermediate the central company that's pulling the profits out of it and so now it's cheaper access for everybody and puts more resource back into the quality it's a transportation and then it becomes self-driving cars so it doesn't actually even have that cost it's just a self [2066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2066.25s)

maintaining dynamic an you say okay now it takes a tiny fraction of the metals coming out of the earth to provide higher quality transportation units for everyone where you having access to transportation as a commonwealth service does not decrease my access to transportation as a commonwealth service but when you use transportation to go to school and learn stuff or to go to a [2087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2087.97s)

maker studio and make stuff or go to a music studio and make stuff you're gonna make theft that also becomes part of a commonwealth enriches the commons that i have access to so we've moved a rivalrous ownership of scarce goods to an anti rival with access to shared commonwealth resources now we went from rivalrouss not just to non-rivalrous meaning uncoupled ray and and rival [2111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2111.09s)

rouss were anti couples your well being is directly against mine but now to anti rivalrouss which is a coupled good where as you have access to more resources that make you more generative what you generate enriches the commons that i have access to so i am engendered i am incentive to want to give you the maximum to support you having the maximum access to generative resources [2133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2133.38s)

now i'm not explaining all of what the feature of the [[economic system]] looks like right now but to just start giving a sense that when we think about the problems of capitalism there there have been problems associated with it forever and but the scale of the problems is just more catastrophic now but i'm also sharing examples of ways that we can start shifting some of the things that [2154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2154.8s)

we couldn't shift previously some of the things that neither marx nor smith had available to them and this is very interesting we have to shift all these systems and we can at the same time and this is to me a very interesting developmental insight when i look at biology in particular is that if we look at the 40 weeks of a baby in utero it can't actually we talked about this [2175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2175.02s)

before but i bring it up again in this context it couldn't be born much earlier it would be preemie and without and icu for it or whatever it would die but it also couldn't stay much longer you could get too big and never be able to be born and kill the mom and kill itself it comes out in a pretty narrow window where both for the first time can it actually now has the capacities and [2195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2195.15s)

hostage can't stay any longer and it's interesting that this it's got 40 weeks on one growth path right it's growing the whole time there's a growth curve it's not gonna stay on that growth curve forever if we tried to forecast its future and just continue the progression of 40 weeks around 50 weeks it kills itself in the mom right so that's not the thing it goes through this discrete [2213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2213.0s)

nonlinear phase shift that if i had never seen it before i'd have no idea how to predict and out of the birth canal umbilical cord cuts respiration through the lung stuff coming in through the mouth rather than the belly button everything's different and it does it in a way that's unprecedented to the whole 40 weeks of its existence previously so if i tried to [2232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2232.32s)

the curve of what has been it is not bad and it does it both when it has to end can and if we look at any type of developmental phase chicken developing inside of an egg if it tried to come out earlier is still goo if it tried to stay in later it starts if we look at a caterpillar to butterfly through chrysalis same thing if it tried to just keep eating it would eat itself to [2252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2252.87s)

extinction if it tried to go into the chrysalis earlier doesn't have enough resources to make a butterfly it would die in the chrysalis this partial good this is really interesting that when we look at discrete nonlinear phase shifts where there's one phase right the caterpillar is getting bigger and bigger and bigger eating everything in its environment and if i just forecasted it [2271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2271.59s)

keeps being there i forecast it eats all the environment and it does except that's not what happens it does this really different thing that is not an extension of the previous curve and so when we try to take our capitalism curve our nationalism curve our science and tech curve and keep extending him it's just silly and it's why we come up with silly stuff like it asymptotes [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2289.98s)

into infinity with the singularity it's just you know on one side if we take all the things that seem like they're good then if we ask them toth into a singularity if we take the things that look bad then it just goes into self extinction it's neither of those curves right cuz is getting exponentially more powerful which means better and worse at the same time but that means [2308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2308.19s)

it's neither of those curves that means that this phase is just coming to an end it's destabilizing the things that are getting exponentially worse will in the phase before the things that are getting exponentially better will change the nature of those things but that means that what we're actually going to get something altogether other if it is other than extinction and it's very [2326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2326.43s)

interesting that we're at the place where these types of dynamics both have to change right now because that we have catastrophic level tech that we never had to have the same things that always suck to be unsurvivable and can change because we actually have the level of insights that make possible things that are different at a deep enough axiomatic level if it's kind of like when you know [2347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2347.55s)

you've got a bunch of cells competing against each other and then there's this metamorphosis for now they're inside of a slime mold and they're act and there are part of the multicellular organism where they're participating together as part of a shared identity that's like a really deep level of reorganization and people going from that shift as separate rivalrous competitive agents modeling themselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] trying to compete with each other to be the most [[apex predator]] and predate the environment so we modelled ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] right there was an easy thing to do we look around at nature and we were like we're kind of more like lions than gazelles we look a lot like chimpanzees they're kind of badass hunter [[apex predator]] they coordinate etcetera so we're like that cruel to the [[apex predator]] thing so we both want to see where we can get in the dominance hierarchies and we get add the prestige hierarchy but how we do within our tribe but in our tribe as a whole our species as a whole relative to the other species is ins kind of apex position there's a reason why we cannot think that way anymore and again we felt [2408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2408.71s)

this way forever and we cannot take this way anymore when i say we thought this way forever i don't mean every indigenous tribe talk this way because they didn't write they had a web of life and were merely a strand and it types of thoughts but the ones that thought this way became more [[apex predator|apex predators]] and killed those other people and so it was effective to try [2424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2424.34s)

and do this [[apex predator]] thing up till now but now it also destroys everything so again the thing that has been adaptive is now anti adaptive which is why the thoughts that have made us win or the thoughts that make us extinct now and so if i take any pix predator how its ability to be a predator its ability to kill other things and compete with the other predators for who's most [2447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2447.65s)

badass is pretty fixed and it's pretty symmetrically bound with its environment so lions can't get better at killing faster than gazelles get better at running and so they co evolved where the lion slowly get a little bit better at some things and the gazelles also get better at other things because if the lions just rapidly got way better they'd kill all the gazelles and then debase [2469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2469.43s)

their own capacity to keep living and then they'd be extinct if great white could make mile-long drift nets and just take all the fish out of the ocean and reproduce at an exponential rate like they would have already self induced extinction but they can't all the years the great rice never got a driftnet but we have drift nets and we have [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and we have d nines and we have the ability to technologically extend our predatory capacity and to do so in a way that exponential and that makes us completely asymmetric with the environment that we depend on so again i come back to the lion and they say all right the most badass lion the most badass gorilla is not like 10x more badass than the next most badass grow up [2513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2513.28s)

it's like marginally better right like marginally can win in a fight and only for a pretty short period of time before the next guy takes it but then you look at like a putin or a trump and you say how much military capacity does that one person have to bear if they wanted to or economic capacity compared to say a homeless guy you look at the spread and you're like oh this is a very different [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2535.03s)

distribution of power than any other species has other species did not have a million x power dynamics within the same species or a billion x that like it was freaking tremendous or that much more power relative to their environment so if the lions could get technologically more advanced in their predation faster than gazelles could it would debase the stability of the entire ecosystem the [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2558.52s)

thing to realize is like if a cancer cell starts replicating in a way that's good for it it's actually getting more sugar and replicating faster inside the body if it keeps doing that it kills its host and kills itself it is ultimately suicidal its own short-term success is suicidal viruses that kill people too quickly don't propagate for very long because they kill their hosts they don't [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2577.99s)

get a chance to propagate the viruses that are less lethal end up being the ones that gets selected for over a longer period of time to get a chance to propagate so if there was a species that was so good at hunting that it killed everything in its environment then it would go extinct so it's not the most competitive advantage that makes it through its self stabilizing ecosystems [2595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2595.09s)

that make it through just such a way more complete understanding of evolution which is individuals within a species don't make it through because they wouldn't have survived without the whole species and species don't even make it through because they wouldn't survive without other species whole evolutionary self-stabilizing niches make it through that's important thrace [2616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2616.54s)

yeah this whole idea of survival of the fittest is kind of challenged with this concept because at no point are we is survival of the fittest taking the whole system into account going forward and infinitely like it has to go through that phase shift yeah survival of the fittest was something that had a local truth but was not the only global phenomena that was [2639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2639.24s)

operating because there was also a tremendous amount of cooperation it was happening in cooperation within members of a species with each other and between species and interdependence on each other and so but again it was like almost the idea of competition it's a [[hypernormal stimuli]] it was like an early [[hypernormal stimuli]] hijack like sugar and porn and airbrushed pictures [2659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2659.37s)

and likes on facebook because in an [[evolutionary environment]] sites stand out even though they're not mostly what's happening right like mostly if i'm in a forest there's a gazillion interactions happening every second of aerobic and anaerobic soil bacteria having a relationship with each other and gas exchange between me and the plants it's just boring but it's like almost [2678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2678.09s)

everything but then i see a couple lions fighting in like oh that's really interesting rights to rebel with fittest so there is this [[hypernormal stimuli]] that made us actually miss emphasized what was happening as a part of the phenomena that was not all of the phenomena miss emphasizes now there's also this thing there's we're moving forward right now [2698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2698.13s)

the way we have been applying that thinking which is that some individual agents or some in groups countries companies races whatever some in groups can be more fit to survive than others through better militaries or better economic extraction tech or bettered info and disinfo and narrative tech that has always been true i'm not criticising that that was always true and even [2724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2724.98s)

necessary because if one tribe killed another tribe and their life got better because now the other tribe wasn't competing for pigs with them and now they got all the pigs and they got like all the stone tools that our tribe it may whatever they're like oh i realized that that's like killing other tribes thing is actually a pretty good evolutionary strategy now all the other [2744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2744.15s)

tribes have to build militaries or die by default right the win-lose game becomes obligate so one the win-lose game worked it actually worked if you were good at it and two it was obligate which is if you didn't do it you got killed by genghis khan or alexander the great or whoever the it was right when we look at culture that did not focus on militaries but [2765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2765.38s)

focused on the arts and humanities and education and healthcare and etc that out competed the other cultures in terms of quality of life but that wasn't where that the thing actually got decided they all got murdered and the really effective murdering cultures combined and combined and made it through and that's us today and yet the tools of murdering and their tools of [2786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2786.95s)

environmental extraction are going up and up until we're at a level where the playing field just cannot handle that game anymore you can't keep extracting more stuff from the environment when you've already got peak resource when you've got the biodiversity issues and [[species extinction]] issues and etc you can't keep polluting an environment when you've got [2804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2804.28s)

[[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean from nitrogen runoff and co2 levels in the air and etc getting to the point of cataclysm and you can't keep doing increasing military tech at following [[exponential tech]] curves we're then non-state actors can have fully catastrophic level tech and you can't even monitor it you just can't keep playing that game and so this is the gist is that the thing that has [2829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2829.79s)

always defined the game is that it's always been a rivalrous [[game theory|game theoretic]] environment and the rivalrous [[game theory|game theoretic]] environment if it can produce tech that keeps increasing will always self-terminate at a point and we just happen to be in the eminence of that point so this is the first [[generator function]] of x risk now we tie this over back to the beginning of the [2852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2852.08s)

conversation and i obviously got long-winded the beginning conversation we said why are we focusing on risk well if we're focused on how do we design a civilization that is actually good enough it's beautiful it's desirable those are hard terms and we'll get to that in a minute that starts to get to some of the inadequacy of the thing we call science right now and it's in [2873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2873.8s)

commensurability with ethics get to that but what does a beautiful civilization look like well the first thing we can say kind of easily is that it doesn't self terminate if itself terminates we can mostly all agree that's actually not a desirable thing so if it is inexorably [[self-terminating]] it is structurally [[self-terminating]] not just kind of like one little accident that we can [2897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2897.38s)

but over determined through mini vectors because of underlying [[generator function|generator functions]] that's not a good civilization design so the first design criteria of an effective civilization is that it's not self determining so then we say well what are the things that cost self-termination and what we find is that even though [2912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2912.859s)

there are a gazillion different ways that it can express ways that it can actually happen it's from some very deep underlying dynamics that if we understand those and we solve them at the dynamics level we fix all of them so the first one is this topic we've been talking about and we talked about previously which is the rivalrous games multiplied by [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] self-determining because rivalrous games cause harm with power and more power ends up being more harm until it's more than more than is handleable a playing field we got that so [[exponential tech]] whether we're looking at a scenario of everything getting up by ai or by bio warfare or by nanotech stuff or by read so many different types of scenarios those are all the same types [2959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2959.539s)

of choices humans have been making just with those exponential powers at it given that we cannot put those technologies away we cannot get the world to stop making them much as i often this we could we either figure out how to move from arrivalrous to an anti rival rif environment that is developing and deploying those technologies or we self-terminate so this is the first [2983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=2983.599s)

design criteria is that we have to create rigorously anti rivalrous environments it doesn't end up being all of it i'll do two [[generator function|generator functions]] that's one and that is what we see in terms of all of the either [[exponential tech]] risks or war risks or economic collapse leading to failed state scenario risks they all come from things like that now all of the like [3013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3013.599s)

environmental biosphere collapse stuff is also related to tech getting bigger right as we're fishing out more fish as we're getting more co2 it also relates that but it's a slightly different thing that we look at here which is whether we're talking about co2 in the air or mercury in the air or the water or microplastics in the water or a continent of plastic [3035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3035.74s)

in the ocean or nitrogen affluent in the river deltas or those are all toxicity dynamics those are all basically stuff that has accumulated somewhere that it shouldn't have right we call that pollution so we don't need to solve the [[dead zone|dead zones]] issue or the co2 issue or that we have to solve all of those categorically that we're not creating accumulation dynamics and on the other [3058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3058.48s)

side of that same coin is depletion dynamics so cutting down all the old-growth forests fishing out all of the fish [[species extinction]] [[biodiversity loss]] peak nitrogen peak oil etc those are all where we are using something in a way that depletes it then it gets turned into trash or pollution on the other side were to accumulate somewhere so we can define toxicity formally as [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3083.32s)

depletion or accumulation because of an open loop in a network diagram and if the loop was closed the things wouldn't accumulate they would go back to the source of where we would get something from so it wouldn't have to deplete and we noticed that when we see any kind of natural system we go to an ecosystem whether it's of coral reef or a forest or whatever won't go to forest there is [3106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3106.09s)

no trash the body of something dies it's compost there's feces it's compost something gets cut and bleeds it processes don't matter what it is anything you can think about that is part of that environment from an evolutionary sense the environment designed to be evolved to be able to process and there's also no unknowable use of anything right anything that is [3126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3126.88s)

utilized is utilized in a closed-loop fashion so one of the things we see in [[complex system|complex systems]] and natural systems is comprehensive loop closure one of the things we noticed about the human design systems is open loops everywhere the [[materials economy]] itself linear [[materials economy]] that takes version stuff and turns it into trash after using it for a very short period of time [3147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3147.88s)

is a macro open loop but there's micro open loops everywhere we have to categorically solve that right we have to basically close all of those loops and another way of saying what this [[generator function]] of issues is is that nature the stuff that nature makes is what we call complex right it's self-organizing self-creating self-organizing [3168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3168.359s)

self-repairing and the stuff we make design tools is complicated it brad right like the computer we're talking on is rad but if it got broken it would not self repair and it didn't self organize it was made it was soldered whatever made them design from the outside we can think about complex stuff comes about through evolution complicated stuff comes about through design two different [3192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3192.09s)

types of creative processes with fundamentally different characteristics and complex stuff has comprehensive loop closure everywhere because it couldn't external eyes something and still be selected for adaptivity right the adaptiveness factors everything whereas if i'm building something i might make it for one reason or two or three reasons but it actually [3212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3212.73s)

affects a lot of other stuff but the other stuff wasn't what i was trying to optimize for so it ends up being where externalities occur so even this computer i'm talking to you on right now was not optimized it was optimized for a bunch of things so it's really cool but the fact that it's got a backlit screen that is 2d that's at a fixed focal length from my eyes where i'm getting [3232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3232.5s)

macular degeneration from spending too many hours on it was one of the things that my eye health was not one of the things that was built to try and focus on or the fact that it's up my posture ergonomically by me looking down at the screen it wasn't one of the things that tried to focus on or the you know a gazillion other things right what happened to the environment and the [3249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3249.45s)

[[supply chain]] process of getting the metals to make hitter the making of this computer affected a gazillion things that were not part of its design criteria which means the making of it required externalizing a bunch of harm ie a bunch of open loops where it affected stuff it was not internalized to the process we can see that if a forest burns it repairs itself if a [3267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3267.99s)

house burns it does not repair itself and if my computer gets broken it doesn't fix itself but if i cut myself it fixes so there's this fascinating difference reason we're bringing this up is to say if for something to be anti fragile it has to be complex complexity is the defining origin of antifragility and complicated things are all ultimately fragile more or less fragile [3293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3293.73s)

if we have a situation where complicated subsume their complex substrate then this means continue to grow right so basically we're converting the complexity of the natural world into the complicated built world and it's continuing to grow it will eventually collapse because the complicated world and if you know it's just like my computer the water infrastructure is [3317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3317.06s)

complicated not complex the pipes don't self repair they can break easily they're subject to being broken on purpose or accident rate the same is true with the everything right the roads the energy grids everything now when i look at globalization i say i've got an increasingly interconnected complicated world that is increasingly more complicated where the failures anywhere [3341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3341.03s)

can prevail yours in more places because nowhere can actually make its own stuff anymore it's just as complicated enough has to be made across this whole thing right like this computer we're speaking on took six continents to make and so if china died everywhere is if the u.s. died if there's so many play that if if mining wasn't accessible in africa everywhere sucked and we see an [3365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3365.15s)

increasingly interconnected li complicated which also means increasingly fragile built world that we're trying to run exponentially more energy through in terms of human activity dollars etc etc and that's happening while decreasing the complexity of the biosphere far enough that if known antifragility is going away we're getting to a place where [3391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3391.46s)

rather than climate being self stabilizing it can go into auto destabilizing positive feedback cycles where the biodiversity is getting low enough that you can get catastrophic shifts in the nature of the homeostasis this made it possible to have a biosphere like the one that we've lived in if you have a world where complicated systems are subsuming their complex [3410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3410.78s)

substrate and continuing to grow they will eventually collapse so these are two different [[generator function|generator functions]] where we can say if i'm trying to solve ocean [[dead zone|dead zones]] or plastic or [[species extinction]] as one offs i will certainly fail because at most i move the curve collapse a year but there's so many other scenarios for fail that are over determined if i don't solve the [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3437.48s)

[[generator function]] of all of them i haven't actually got it the having a right relationship between complex and complicated and having loop closure within the complicated and creating anti rivalrous basis it is a safe basis for [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] is the first level of assessment of necessary design criteria for a viable civilization music alright that's it for this episode to continue listening to the second and third parts of this fascinating interview go to future thinkers org slash 57 and to check out our sponsor qualia go to future thinkers org slash brain hack if you're new to the show and you'd like a list of our top episodes and resources go to future thinkers org slash start if you want to sponsor our [3483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAd9O6a6R5w&t=3483.26s)
