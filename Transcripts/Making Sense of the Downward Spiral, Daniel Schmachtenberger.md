music so in the last few days as we see what started in minneapolis and then went to atlanta and seattle and then everywhere in the us it's interesting how consuming a new cycle can make the most concerning issue of three days ago almost completely absent in people's minds and attention but you also lose almost all perspective if that happens so it's important to kind of pay attention to [25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=25.289s)

the sequence of things and the narrative arc and the things that are not forefront in the attention cycle so right before the racial violence became forefront we were seeing in the us and escalation towards violence there was very left-right oriented between red state blue state having different focus around how they were going to open and it was kind of showing up as the mask [50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=50.219s)

wears versus the non mask wears and we saw armed people going to capitol buildings in protest of quarantine and shut down we also started to see an increase in racial focus in the news over the week leading up to the case in minneapolis that set it all off and i'm not gonna say like a single narrative of some central command and control function that i think is orchestrating [88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=88.53s)

everything but i'm gonna mention anomalies that i think you should be paying attention to so we see the case of the man who was jogging and the retired cop and his son shot him that was like a week before and then we see increased news of white supremacy and a lot more images of white guys with guns at capitol buildings then we see in relationship to the guy who was running [119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=119.82s)

and got shot and there were protests black open carry of weapons associated with the protests and then also black open carry of weapons taking escorting a black lawmaker to the courthouse or some state building and then we see joe biden's comments about you ain't black and like just a whole bunch of increase in race attention in primary news cycles and then we see the [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=151.349s)

case with george floyd so there's a big question for me of like did we just have a particular unusually racist week or does the new cycle not actually reflect the background rate of things for other reasons and for it for every situation like we see with george floyd the number of those that aren't caught like it's just um it's just a much less rare phenomena than i think most people think [188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=188.23s)

it is sadly i think most black people in inner cities know it's not as rare a phenomena so then we see the video circulating that the we see this guy with a hammer and black tactical gear breaking the windows of the autozone right in minneapolis and we see people jumping to thinking assessing that he's a cop as an agent provocateur or that he is a antifa guy or a white supremacist [219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=219.88s)

or a soros agent there's a lot of different hypotheses but a lot of images are surfacing of the buildings being set on fire and the windows being broken by white people at the black protest rallies that were not breaking like me and the initial movement to property destruction and violence was not actually then and broken windows theory is very clear that once like who ones [244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=244.87s)

the first molotov cocktails thrown and it becomes much easier to engage in throwing molotov cocktails once the first windows are broken because there's like a threshold to move past that that has already been broken and so the idea that police officers or people with other agendas infiltrate a protest group that is otherwise peaceful and throw the [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=273.78s)

first rock to justify use of police force on the other side like that's a very well-known phenomenon but right now we can hypothesize a lot of groups that would have a motive to do it for a lot of reasons so some people either are buying the standard narrative or they're too quickly jumping to the alternate narrative of it was the cop for this reason or it was the white supremacists [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=293.789s)

trying to blame the black guys or it was the deep state hillary clinton joe biden supporting liberals that are trying to create incite more reason to have people stay at home than the quarantine already was to move towards their goal to steal an election there's like a gazillion hypotheses i think the problem is the people who aren't buying the mainstream media narrative are buying the first [322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=322.259s)

alternate narrative that appeals to their [[sensemaking]] desire to not have uncertainty and put the pieces together before there's adequate evidence that that alternate narrative is actually much better so the guy who broke the windows was definitely not a normal part of the protest but i don't know who he was an agent for or what the motive was because the data that suggests any of [349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=349.58s)

the 10 different hypotheses are not solid yet so one of the things i'm wanting to encourage is don't let your attention cycle be controlled by the attention cycle of your [[social media]] feed or your mainstream news that's one thing the other thing is be very careful about how easy it is to get induced into being on one side of groupthink and [[conflict theory]] let's talk about [[conflict theory]] for a moment it's there's a few types of natural cleaving x' or easy cleaving ziff not natural where it's very easy to drive conflict between people political left-right is a very easy one you can do red state blue state stuff you can do they have a make america again hat versus a rainbow gay flag at like they're they're literally wearing [403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=403.199s)

flags of different kinds to symbolize red shirt blue shirt right like the type type of team they're in and then you can drive conflict between them which both creates a sense of clear [[sensemaking]] of i know who my team is i know what my might the group think of the narrative on my side it is and so red blue is very easy people versus the cops is very easy race issues are very easy races may be [430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=430.55s)

the easiest because it's where the flag is biologically built-in if everybody here has not studied [[conflict theory]] you're gonna have a hard time making sense of the world without a good model of how conflict arises between people how it gets intentionally stirred up how people resolve it and there's a lot of difference schools of conflicts area that are worth studying but at a minimum [460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=460.319s)

everybody should know rene gerard's work and i'm not saying that i agree with gerard there are things that he said that we're extremely insightful so specifically his idea is that the fundamental nature of conflicts comes from the fact that desire is mimetic meaning that we learn to want stuff the same way we learn language by watching other people and that i don't know [496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=496.589s)

mandarin and i don't know so he lee and i don't know dutch because i didn't watch people speaking those i watch people speak in english so i got conditioned to think in a world view through aesthetic frames through like it's very deep how much my whole identity and everything was conditioned by what i watched so his arguments is that much of what we want is also [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=518.31s)

conditioned by watching people and so we end up in nate lee wanting what other people have which means that desire and extra blee drives conflict somebody people have stuff you want that thing more similar kinds of things then as more people are wanting the same things and conflicting over it the conflict itself becomes mimetic people learn through [541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=541.44s)

mimesis to identify with the zionist or the anti-zionist side based on which side of the wall they grew up on or the you know whatever the conflict they happen to have been born into and then in gerard's model the conflict continues to increase until there's so much embodied energy that you're gonna get something like a war and the least violent way to deal with it is to have a [565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=565.26s)

scapegoat a sacrificial rather than a all against all war be able to have some sacrificial person that everybody gets that is able to be effectively blamed for the whole scenario and then we're able to take them out and decrease the embodied conflict energy for a while then the cycle has to repeat jords work really says that there is no there historically has been no way out of that [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=595.709s)

and the role of various religions was to figure out how to do scapegoating well and that that's what all of the sacrifices of various religious traditions were about that christianity was actually trying to get rid of scapegoating by showing the person they scapegoated was actually innocent - not only innocent with the highest kind of innocence so that the way people would [618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=618.98s)

get out of his answer actually of how you get out of scapegoating was everyone developed christ-like virtues but specifically as critique said that by getting rid of religion and this is relevant to the goals of this group that is trying to reinvent of human virtue by getting rid of religion we got rid of the way of dealing with the mimetic conflict while simultaneously getting [648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=648.54s)

much much larger weapons of destruction so that rather than have things heat up in europe and kill a jew sacrificially it had to be this massive kind of killing of all of these jews and so okay so why am i bringing that up i think it's very easy to i think there are lots of reasons to want to drive conflict and to want to keep groups of people having attention focused in [687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=687.27s)

different ways maybe this is actually the way i'll talk about it power pretty much translates to power over other people to have power over their behaviors whether i want people to vote for me in a particular way or i want them to buy my stuff or i want them to publicly support my ideas i need to control other people's behavior to control their behavior i need to control [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=714.0s)

their minds and so warfare is main mainly not fought with bullets like the kinetic warfare that we think of as warfare that's fought with weapons is maybe 1% of warfare 99% of warfare is diplomatic warfare political warfare economic warfare [[narrative warfare]] information warfare all of this comes together to what we call hybrid warfare or really just politics or [[game theory]] or the game of power but but think of it as high hybrid or population centric warfare so in this war the treasure being fought over is people's minds and the battleground is people's minds the primary weapons are tools the tools of narrative influence and emotionally vacation and control of the information flows and in these wars they're [779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=779.31s)

asymmetric wars because you have some actors that have access to billion or trillion-dollar level information technologies and ki empowered micro targeting and then you have other people are just to figure  __  out on their own and they don't even know they're in a war and they don't even know that their own mind is the battleground of the war and they [805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=805.29s)

think they believe the  __  they believe and they think they came to it on their own they think they're doing a good job [[sensemaking]] and they don't realize that as they're researching of the trillions of pages of  __  they could see the ones that they will ever even be able to see based on what shows up in their youtube feed or their google search or manipulated by algorithms that have [824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=824.779s)

agendas behind them as well as the original source material of whoever put it out for which reasons ok so zooming out from the current violence for moments we have an election coming up in the u.s. that will be radically consequential for the world either way no matter who wins currently whether the election is illegally tampered with and stolen or not half of the population [858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=858.029s)

will think it was this is a real problem right because what happens when a third to a half of the population no matter which way it goes thinks that it was stolen and thinks it was radically consequential well like one of two really bad things happens either the people get violent much more so than we currently have and that sets off one [883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=883.62s)

whole cascade of scenarios where they don't get violent and the people who want to steal elections get even clearer that they just can with impunity so we're like  __  what do we do with this moving forward now mail-in ballots our mail-in ballots easier to corrupt than in-person voting yep totally a & co vid as one reason violence could be another but co vid is one reason to have mail-in [918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=918.99s)

ballots like might there be reasons associated with that yeah now might there be reasons that people who really want trump out of office would want to initiate things that make trump look worse and that say look at all the bad  __  that's happening during trump we could also talk about what motive the trump campaign would have to be engaged in [940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=940.5s)

something where you wouldn't want transfer of power to occur so i'm not there's a there's a version of this that is easy to buy for either political leaning i don't find that most successful politicians that i have encountered near the top of the power actually believe red vs. blue ideology they just believe in the game of power and they signal red vs. blue ideology as [970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=970.47s)

part of their mimetic warfare to control the people that are going to vote for them just like i don't think most of the people that end up engaging religions and holy wars at the most strategic level really even are religious i think they know that these are ways to get people to do things for reasons that are mostly strategic as we look at war a little bit more and we look at the [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1000.8s)

tension heating up on the india china border it's such a big deal like what's happening there and the india china pakistan interaction and the india china russia interaction and as we look at it with kovat related stuff obviously what what happens to the spread of the virus with all of the protests that are definitely not social distancing well we'll find out what happens when like [1025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1025.43s)

with germany and south korea and china who started to get second waves of infection after reopening what happens when we start to get second waves here and the political tension is so heated around the idea of closing again and then we also start to see things like because of the cova chat down of transportation the [[food supply]] system got radically damaged right giver [1064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1064.04s)

take the [[food supply]] for two billion people got damaged and so nigeria has a 25 million person in secure food population that all went from food insecure to actually don't have food and now violence has been raising on the ground both insurgencies local crime and boko haram that's probably going to trigger an exodus and a massive refugee situation but after syria it's like [1090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1090.86s)

where do the refugees go so then what it what comes from that conflict why so we're definitely at a unique moment in the world we are at a moment where because of the connectedness of [[supply chain|supply chains]] because of the ability for viruses in airplanes to move around the world so fast because of the ability of news cycles to move so fast so we go from an event in [1113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1113.51s)

minneapolis to in every city because of because of those things the inner connection for the cascade of events from anywhere to everywhere and from one sector to other sectors is so high on top of systemic fragility on top of very high embodied emotional energy this next phase of time is going to see a continuance of a cascade of very serious problems how do we make sense of the [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1146.21s)

world given all of these dynamics and how do we respond i always feel stuck when someone asks me there how do we for some very large audience have we respond because it's gonna be very different based on people's skills and capacities and interests there's not like a very good generalized answer to that like david how are you responding well [1170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1170.5s)

you're trying to both put out information that helps people and share frames that help people process information and maybe that helps them get less emotionally hijacked so they can have some more clarity like those seem like within your bailiwick of things to do that you can do super important things that need done there's gonna be an equivalent of that [1197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1197.1s)

in totally different ways that everyone on here has as a possibility so i think people recognizing that they actually have some choice and where they put their attention and some choice in the meaning they make so both where they focus and actually they have choice and where they put their attention they have choice in the process of coming to belief are they just kind of letting [1230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1230.95s)

themselves by the conclusions put in front or are they really asking that am i sure of this how would i be sure of this because they're going there's going to be a response to their own sense of certainty or uncertainty and they also have some choice in the meaning they make around the things and all this is gonna affect their state so it means it's overwhelm is something someone [1253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1253.149s)

really has a choice to indulge or not and so sometimes i'll notice that there's so much coming in and i'm like what the  __  do i do about this and there's a beginning impulsive overwhelmed and i know i i'm not trying to pretend or repress it but i also know that going into an overwhelm is not useful and i have a kind of deep commitment to be useful so i have a deep [1278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1278.32s)

commitment to want to think about things in a way that allows me to continue to respond so i'll be like okay well let's just step back and actually write down what are all the things that i see going on let's make a situational assessment map right let's so rather than just start to spiral into something like let me start to identify what are the knowns what are the unknowns what are the [1300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1300.669s)

things i might be able to do something about where i want to put more of my [[sensemaking]] into that area because i might actually have some agency in that area so some people on here that will what is theirs to do will be largely around serving their local communities but you know other people might have might work in the finance sector and have specific [1330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1330.47s)

things that they can do that are particularly meaningful to be able to get the right types of projects funded or yeah i don't know what i can say not to do right is definitely make sure okay here's an important one i'll say one thing to do understand the basics of strategy if you're gonna try and do anything so that you don't just make sure it worse or be [1363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1363.98s)

totally useless so strategy 101 every response everything that you do if you're effective some people will not like and it will evoke a counter response factor the counter response in what you're doing and see if it's still a good idea if you are not factoring counter responses you are not doing strategy you're just being reactive now you might be super righteous in your [1397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1397.52s)

reactivity but you that doesn't mean that you are actually a pawn that is being manipulated by forces that are doing strategy you aren't actually doing strategy and so if you're wanting to do something to make sure trump doesn't get reelected or to make sure that systemic racism gets addressed or whatever it is you just have to think in this particular action who that will feel [1427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1427.01s)

threatened by this will counter respond in what ways and what resources are available to them and if i'm escalating the game right if i'm increasing the war on one side driving an [[arms race]] of escalation am i driving it in the right direction do that if you aren't doing that then you're most likely escalating things in the wrong direction [1456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1456.89s)

you're doing guess listening to you i mean we've done quite a lot of conversations around i think phase shift for humanity was the first one where you talked about the [[self-terminating]] nature of the current dynamic and i guess it's one thing to talk about that and to have seen it as a possibility it's another one when you feel it on a kind of visceral level and [1479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1479.94s)

i wonder i just wonder whether you because you talk i mean you use some beautiful metaphors about the caterpillar and the butterfly and i'd say for talking about kind of phase shift and [[self-terminating]] systems you actually sketch out quite a sort of positive vision as well has that changed or you each still no it hasn't changed i think that everything that's happening [1512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1512.69s)

right now was going to happen some version of it there's a lot of path dependencies if it didn't have to have cove it as a path and it could have been a different pandemic or it could have been grid collapse or it could have been [[climate change]] driving refugees driving a war there's a gazillion things that could have started the cysts the systemic cascades but it was inevitable [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1540.779s)

which is why i like that's mostly what i've talked about for the last six or seven years was trying to have hope people say that was inevitable let's see what we can do to do anticipate ori good good things if you identify every area that there is a risk there is also a meaningful upside and this is a way to think about what might be yours to do when an environmental niche gets [1573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1573.359s)

disturbed it's much easier to have new things come in and change the process so if we go through and look at all of the areas where there are major problems and where there are major risks and say what is the system that's actually breaking down and what would a better version of that system be and what could we do to implement those better versions of the system rather than try to [1599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1599.83s)

reinstate the security of the old ones that would be a beginning of thinking about the opportunity space and we could talk about that with global finance we could talk about it with infrastructure we could talk about it with the healthcare system on and on write the judicial reform all those things and someone just posted this in the chat and i think it's really true so far it seems [1621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1621.1s)

that the pandemic and the crisis is accelerating all of the we're not in a shift into a new system it seems to be just accelerating and compounding all of the worst aspects of the old one most sense of of how that process might play out and where where's the sort of hope in that if there is any most people who care about things widely care about the global commons long term suck at doing [1662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1662.86s)

things like they suck at doing things at scale because most anyone is good at doing things at scale one at the game of power because to do things at scale means to be able to influence things in a way that will beat out competitors and go against people who want things to go otherwise so right now there's a lot of people dirt like during the cova time there's a lot of people feeling like [1694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1694.029s)

they have more free time than ever but the most powerful people in the world have been busier than ever during this time they have been consolidating the market and buying up distressed assets and massively increasing opportunism during this time so one of the things i would say is necessary for it to be other than you just said david is that the people who [1724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1724.01s)

actually are committed to the well-being of humanity and the earth and civilization long term must learn to be how must learn how to be effective at actually making things happen at a global level do you like to ask your question roy yes what do you have to say about yes the the resource of cross-generational mentoring and networking in in the [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1755.2s)

situation we're in it's complex it's easy to say mmm cross generational collaboration is good like it's it's easy to say that diverse perspectives of any kind being in conversation will enrich everyone who is there that's true the current situation that we're facing the last times we face situations that were relevantly analogous none of those people are still alive in terms of the [1793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1793.01s)

generations that actually know anything about it like the people who were in world war 2 aren't still here the people who were in the great depression aren't still here the people who were in the 1918 plague aren't still here and this is like if you study generational theory like straus how or you study baudrillard typically things repeat on the cycle that once the people who had the [1815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1815.57s)

hard-won knowledge are dead we repeat the thing because they're gone right so part of the generational connection i want people to do is study the work of the people who really understood the last relevant issues who happened to be dead it might have been alive a little while now there are still people who were involved in in vietnam and the counterculture movement and who were [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1843.92s)

involved in different times that are relevant and to discuss so like i have a friend mark stallman he was involved during that generation but he was doing intelligence work and like he was working with freeman dyson directly regarding what was brought to jfk to do with khrushchev that was a big part of what's led to things broke down there so there's knowledge that he has [1881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1881.13s)

firsthand that super directly relevant but like when i look at the counterculture movement as a whole and i look at the green revolution and the sexual revolution and the civil rights process and the women's rights all the various things the deeper story that i see most of the activists who were there don't know the deeper story i see is like actually understanding cointelpro [1914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1914.82s)

and how the fbi cia and other intelligence agencies actually infiltrated the the progressive movements to very specifically derail them and get them focused on shift it would be an effective that is that we're still doing today so i happen to believe that there was intentional up regulation by those power structures of post-modernism as a [1943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1943.05s)

structure of thought because if the people who studied social science only studied how to critique the game of power without actually knowing how to effectively organize then it would make sure that they never could actually really do anything so if every time someone's organizing well you call it imperialism you won't end up organizing well becoming an imperialist so you'll [1966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1966.63s)

just be noise and that's fine and the social sciences that are like actually studying the history of military theory and political theory and and strategy itself got very downregulated in exchange for something that would make people feel more righteous while being less effective and so i want to make sure that we're learning the right lessons [1998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=1998.79s)

from the right periods of history so what i would say is that when i think about generations and i take all the generations that are alive now i would say that 99% of the people in all those generations have been the victims of intentional disinformation and a mostly just all confused so we can have intergenerational sharing of some confused generations with others it's [2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2026.36s)

still nice to have different perspectives but i would mostly like for people to have more clear and incisive insight at all and across a longer time period than their own experience a deeper study of history and like that so i was just wondering what you know where you feel stuck and you feel like you're kind of in a hopeless situation making space for grief so emotions of [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2051.1s)

all kind can influence our [[sensemaking]] they can also influence our choice making i want we all know what it's like to have emotions that are not being clearly processed influenced our choice making in damaging ways right reacting out of anger or whatever but then we can also say ok so i don't want to be reactive emotionally so i'm going to suppress emotions and pretend to do like [2089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2089.96s)

do a bad version of stoicism and just numb down emotional intelligence in which case i'm taking one whole type of information one whole way of [[sensemaking]] and turning it off and you could call emotion um this is reductive but i'm just saying one lens you could call emotion a way of being able to read data partly our emotion is responding to [2119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2119.09s)

the situation partly our emotion is responding to the narrative we make of the situation so in terms of the narrative we make that's where we want to do cbt or dbt or byron katie's the work or krishnamurti inquiry it's a see where did i make up some meaning that  __  me up but then there are some times where it's like if i see a cop kneeling on someone's neck and killing [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2145.75s)

them and i don't feel angry something is wrong with me like that's not about meaning-making i actually try and say no i'm only upset because if meaning-making means i have to instantiate a metaphysics where nothing matters and then say well i'm meaning made well yes i have a metaphysics where things matter and in a metaphysics where anything matters then [2167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2167.39s)

if the sacred is being harmed i can feel pissed off i can feel sad i can feel scared right so you know i'm kind of inundated in data about [[catastrophic risk]] so the most  __  up things all the time and so it doesn't have the same emotional response immediately that it did the first time that i was exposed to it but i still will just sit back put my computer down and just cry when i think [2197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2197.39s)

about what's  __  happening in nigeria or when i think about what's about to happen or because if i don't i will actually have to dead in something and then i become less sensitive which means my sensing decreases and the wholeness of self decreases so yeah you you neither want to let you neither want to repress the emotions and not listen to them and learn from them nor do you [2221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWk-ZpJdRFg&t=2221.51s)
