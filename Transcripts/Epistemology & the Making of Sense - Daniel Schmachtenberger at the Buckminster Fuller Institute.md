welcome everyone back to trim tab space camp uh we're here today with daniel schmucktenberger trimtab space camp as you all know is this opportunity for all of us to think big and to explore the world around us and understand the wider context within which we all live we're looking at different defense making frameworks we've learned about ecology and gaian systems and rapid prototyping in this course and leave it to daniel to go meta and teach us about [[sensemaking]] itself daniel is a good friend and a student of buckminster fullers started reading him before he could read [44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=44.0s)

actually uh his parents would read him synergetics as bedtime stories um and he's kind of a protege of fuller's amongst others and just uh i i look to you daniel as a source of wisdom and uh confidant and advisor for the buckminster fuller institute and just such an honor to have you here [70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=70.64s)

today thank you so much for making the time amidst this wild global crisis uh and thank you for all the response work that you've been doing for this i really appreciate it very happy to be here i remember when you and i first talked about this type of course happening for uh bucky fuller institute where [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=89.6s)

people could learn good [[sensemaking]] tools and be able to apply them so i'm just really delighted this happening now i think it's a great service yeah they met a great time so we're going to explore scents making today uh could you kick us off with just telling us some of the core principles of [[sensemaking]] and how we can maybe apply that to this global crisis it's a funny way to see a conversation like principles of [[sensemaking]] and the reason we use a term like [[sensemaking]] is how do we make sense of the world and reality that we live in which is kind of a uh common vernacular for epistemology how do we go about knowing things and what is the basis for appropriate belief [136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=136.4s)

in something and this obviously a not only the basis of the philosophy of science which is how do we go about knowing objective things about the objective world but all of philosophy the epistemics of whatever it is that we're claiming is true about anything what is our basis of our truth claim and so [158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=158.16s)

someone can easily study this field for their whole life and scratch the surface of all the good thinking that has been done and our basis for right action in the world to be effective at anything is going to be our basis of understanding the nature of the world and the nature of being able to consider what the effect of a particular action [176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=176.8s)

are going to be so uh overview of sentence making 101 like we're what i hope we can do is um share a few principles that are a valuable start to just add something to the picture that can also inspire people if they're interested in terms of where they can go further um and maybe be able to show the application of those to things that are currently trending questions with regard to this you know covet 19 global crisis and the attendance out of world issues that are happening so i'm going to assume also that the basic philosophy of science and kind of basic karl popper uh sensibilities and kind of understanding of logical fallacies and critical thinking is at least somewhat familiar and if that's not true then take a look at those terms that i said and at least go read the wikipedia page on them um logical fallacies critical thinking [242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=242.319s)

philosophy of science popper those would be starting places those are by no means an adequate frame for [[sensemaking]] but they are common valuable frames good starting places so i'm going to kind of assume those and build on there uh if i use terms that you think would be unfamiliar please [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=261.44s)

stop me and we'll unpack them so the difference between science and epistemology writ large just to kind of say it is uh science is an epis the method of science is an epistemology it is a process of knowing about the objective world we find ourselves in meaning objects that can be [284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=284.479s)

measured and then where we can do repetition on measurement and then be able to abstract patterns from those but measurable things are third-person things right we can all measure something independently get the same type of measurement and then be able to so measurable and replicable science [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=302.8s)

exists within the domain of the measurable and replicable if you imagine we have a two by two matrix of things that are measurable and unmeasurable there are a lot of things that are real and are unmeasurable like an emotion you can measure a neural correlate and you can't get anywhere close to actually measuring all [318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=318.4s)

the things that are happening we don't even begin to understand how to do that we can do very rough you know qeg whatever kind of stuff you can't measure in motion it's a first person thing you measure third person things uh you can't measure the inside of a black hole you can mathematically infer stuff you can't measure things that are [334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=334.4s)

below the scale of measurability there's a lot of things that are real that are unmeasurable which means they're formally outside of the domain of science but that doesn't mean that we can't that any claim about them is equally true right there are still methods of uh sense-making that are going to be more reliable than [349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=349.759s)

others and then replicable there are certain things that are measurable but not replicable because it's not a control kind of situation where we can replicate it so formally the thing that we call science the processes of science exists within one of four quadrants in which the real includes all of those [369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=369.44s)

so when we talk about [[sensemaking]] we're including all of it and uh so science is necessary but not sufficient and it ends up becoming actually bad epistemology when you collapse the real to the objective right because then subjective is not real if you make real an objective synonymous [391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=391.44s)

subjective is also real but it's not measurable and you can't do repeatability on the non-measurable things right um and intersubjective things are also not subjective right that's that's actually a whole different quadrant of uh things and even some things that are [408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=408.72s)

objective or not properly measurable um or where there's causation but there's no way to assess necessary and sufficient causation in a formal way there's nexus causation like in complexities we have to apply different kinds of principles so um and this is when you hear people talk about the problems of reductionism right [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=427.84s)

trying to reduce all of the real to the objective trying to reduce complex situations to a subset of the variables and that can be very useful reductionism is super useful but it also has limits and so it would be bad [[sensemaking]] to use reductionism without understanding its limits it would also be bad since making to [445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=445.759s)

reject reductionism in a kind of overly sweeping sense now when we're looking at social situations there's and trying to make sense of politics and economics and whatever there's a lot of things where we won't really be able to measure what's going on there's information that our company secrets and trademarks and [470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=470.0s)

patents that are intentionally kept classified or obscured by governments there's stuff that we haven't figured out yet and yet there's still consequence to what's happening now and we want to figure some stuff out that we don't have the ability to do the appropriate formal science on even if it was in the domain of science and [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=485.28s)

why are certain agents doing the things they are has to do with intent which is outside of measurability we can only measure the effects of it and try to infer so [[sensemaking]] of what's actually going on and how do we know and how do we get enough confidence to inform right action and when do we not have enough [502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=502.479s)

confidence to inform right action and how do we have a clear basis for what our confidence margin is and what our confidence margin for right action based on the consequentiality of the situation what should it be this is like kind of how you start to think about what the topics that [[sensemaking]] is addressing are i'll actually speak about confidence for a moment one of the things oh well actually come one step back the essence if you wanted to say there was an essence the essence of good [[sensemaking]] is earnestness in the desire to understand what's happening and in earnestness it [539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=539.279s)

both wants to know what is rather than wants to believe something in particular and an earnestness that is willing to do the work that it takes to actually come to understand that rather than jump to premature beliefs because that is comforting or allows you to be part of an in-group or seem knowledgeable or whatever else kind of brings us back to a couple of [560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=560.56s)

things we've learned both in ecology and in in rapid prototyping just like the importance of humility and curiosity you know of of not being attached being maybe committed to something but not attached to what it may be um in the case of rapid prototyping and then in the case of ecology yeah just [580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=580.48s)

being kind of humble and curious about the world around you and seeing it in more of that kind of dynamic as well right right so curiosity and humility and earnestness these words all kind of go together here right and um so it was a very nice definition of science [598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=598.88s)

eddington gave that science is the earnest endeavor to put into order the facts and experience so what are the facts of experience how do we know and like what are we what am i experiencing what are others experiencing can i trust that they're recording the facts of their experience you know in an adequate way and how do [614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=614.48s)

we put into order some kind of sensibility of that um so if earnestness and like depth of curiosity is the kind of essence of science and epistemology in general then bias would be the enemy of it and bias can come from lots of sources it can come from wanting to be part of an in-group that believes a thing so you [637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=637.68s)

where it's costly not to believe that things you'll be excommunicated from your religion or seen as a conspiracy theorist or a status quo or whatever it is that your particular in-group would happen to see as bad that's going to create a source of bias if you want to be seen as in the know because you have particular kind of ego [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=656.64s)

identifications or you want the previous thing that you did your phd on and got famous for to keep being right even though new stuff is coming out that might suggest otherwise right ego stuff can obviously be a source of i want this to seem true whether it actually is true or not financial interest is probably the main thing that messes science up [673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=673.44s)

because somebody's funding the science and typically that funding is coming from some existing pool of money that made the money by doing something that makes money that is going to fund stuff that makes it more money so it is not interested in things that are not going to make money it's interested in things it [688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=688.8s)

probably will and that means that either self dealing right self dealing and you know even if so it's totally possible that someone is doing science in a way where they're actually doing authentically bad science because of financial interest they are um hiding data and whatever but it's [711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=711.6s)

also possible that someone does quote-unquote good science but that where the preponderance of evidence is misleading because they're only looking at the parts of the whole picture that have profitability so if i look at pharmaceuticals for instance and the research into healthcare doctors currently because the regulatory [731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=731.92s)

landscape in the u.s aren't allowed to prescribe something if it is not fda approved to prescribe that thing fda approval process requires phase 3 clinical trials that cost most of a billion dollars who's going to pay for that well a pharma company can pay for it if they can make that money back [747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=747.2s)

and make enough money back so to be able to make that much money you have to look at a patented thing because otherwise i put in the research money i put in the billion dollars and then i'm selling something competing on the margins with other people that can make the thing at the same cost and didn't have the upfront billion dollars [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=761.92s)

so i've got to be able to recoup that money by having a much higher price that nobody can undercut me so we can only patent synthetic molecules for the most part not things that are in plants or nutrients or whatever so those things are just never going to get the same kind of research funding so then you'll have a preponderance of evidence that [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=778.079s)

says these things are more effective than these things but it was because they were and it's not even necessarily that each study was bad but it's it's not well distributed the distribution of what's being studied in the distribution of reality don't match right and um so that's another place [792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=792.079s)

where bias is going to uh be able to affect and mess up [[sensemaking]] so because of that i would say that we have less real science in the world than i would like to see and we have a lot more of the r d arm of capitalism and this becomes one of the things that for individuals trying to make sense of the world when you're even if you're [813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=813.519s)

reading scientific papers trying to make sense of all of the papers in a space together trying to make sense of the biases of the authors trying to make sense of the bias associated with the funding looking at the methodology itself these are all things that are worth factoring when trying to make sense of something i was going to say something about [832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=832.72s)

confidence and certainty so it's very one of the major sources of bias is emotional biases do we talk about cognitive bias a lot in science and that there are like all of these logical fallacies or cognitive bias but a lot of them come from emotional or identity or existential or [853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=853.92s)

social kind of needs where believing something actually feels like it is meeting some need or way for me to live so i have a basis other than just knowing what's true to want to believe something in particular so a lot of people who are seeking security conflate that the way to get security is [872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=872.079s)

certainty about the nature of reality and so they will seek excessive levels of certainty with an insufficient process for gaining it because they actually have a certainty bias because they're unsafe if they don't have that right or something like that that's an example it's not exhaustive so a fundamentalist religion would be a [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=892.399s)

classic example where i am utterly certain about the absolute nature of reality the name of god uh what happens after you die and all this kind of stuff and it's like really um that whole idea only came about not that many thousands of years ago and before that that people were just as certain about other [913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=913.76s)

and uh that you know that that particular god name had never been proposed and um but there is the you can see in the face of the uncertainty and the unknown of death if someone is not friends with the unknown if they're not friends with uncertainty and they have then [930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=930.079s)

where they can't see they can project scariness into that space then they want to be certain and so they want to have faith even if it's not epistemically grounded it's actually very interesting people's fear of dark and it's like why is it that i'm more afraid of the exact same environment [952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=952.16s)

when i just can't see it than when i could when it's the same environment with the same agents in it and i'm not even somewhere that has nocturnal animals or whatever like what maybe sometimes that's warranted but a lot of times that's not warranted right so where does that come from well if i can see i know there's nothing bad if i can't then my mind starts [969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=969.759s)

projecting stuff in there people have this of dark water of deep water you know where they can't see in death right so and unknown in general so it's very easy to have a bias towards certainty and now that can be expressed through people who are quote unquote using scientific ideas just as much as it can religious [988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=988.16s)

ones so there are people who are quoting science but what you can see is they don't think of science as a process of knowing they think of it as a body of knowledge and that there are these things called facts and that they're totally well known and that those people who understand it are right [1003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1003.519s)

and other people are not just wrong but stupid and um and uh and they you'll notice that the bias and the nature of their communication is to always have pretty high certainty even it's just even if it's just very high certainty that other people who are presenting something that doesn't look like the science they want are certainly wrong and so you're like oh they've got that same bias going and they're plugging in a science uh set of languages rather than a religious set now on the same side people can have a bias towards uncertainty but these are still biases so this is classically what happened with post-modernism right and post-modernism said science actually claimed some that it shouldn't have claimed it actually had the wrong epistemology and it had bias going and this was specifically in the social sciences where uh whatever victorian white men were looking at the racial superiority of men or [1064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1064.799s)

the white race or looking for monogamous pair bonding in nature because of victorian ideals when they did zoology or whatever you're like oh this is actually a pretty significant [[confirmation bias]] messing up the thing that we're calling science but being accepted scientific ideals so then there became this idea that science was just the same as all [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1083.2s)

the other i'm giving an extreme example so forgive me obviously foucault and daradah were not stupid and they didn't say this but a lot of the people who don't read them all that well make this kind of generalization that uh that there is no truth there is no absolute truth there is no way of knowing what is more true and [1104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1104.0s)

that anyone who claims to have a more more access to or a valid process of truth is just some form of imperialism and that because science wasn't spreading industrialism at the same time that empires were using it to suppress the lower class and kill indigenous people and ruin the environment that those are somehow [1125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1125.52s)

conflated and that then all perspectives on reality are equally valid and we need to listen to them all equally and there are no valid truth claims this is gibberish right because recognizing that social science is subject to bias in a particular way where you have extraordinarily high complexity and a high basis for bias is [1144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1144.08s)

very different than say physical chemistry that does not conform to it like that's very very simple and uh doesn't have the same kind of bias being admitted so um and also then the fact that some people did social science badly doesn't mean that it can't be done more earnestly and better so it doesn't mean does it mean that we [1165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1165.36s)

always want to be looking at bias yes in science that we shouldn't consider science unbiased yes but does it mean that all truth claims are equally valid no the social science thing is the um acronym weird weird populations white educated industrialized rich and democratic there's a narrative a you know a [1187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1187.52s)

rightfully so narrative that a lot of the social scientists uh sciences have been studied on weird populations those you know people who are kind of readily available in uh industrialized college settings um so that's one thing that people have been pointing to more and more and i think it's it's really important right now for us [1210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1210.64s)

to kind of just point out like where where are we exhibiting different you know racist or colonialist perspectives but yeah also not throwing out the baby with the bathwater and i think that differentiation you made of science being a methodology rather than kind of like the set of um [1232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1232.96s)

truth that's like already known um is really critical you know as we're putting out the design science you know decade uh as buckminster fuller institute like getting people to kind of blend in the design thinking with um all that we can um yeah glean and understanding the world through science uh it's really helpful to have [1257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1257.76s)

that differentiation so when you think about the social sciences here and what we said in the beginning about the measurable and repeatable i can measure a chemical pretty well i can do different types of measurements i can use microscopy and spectrometry and whatever and and then contrast that and a lot of other people independently can and uh the physical properties the chemical properties of it will conform pretty well i can't measure what someone feels or really the nature and nuance and complexity of what they think or the sense of their relationships or their motives are [1298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1298.72s)

or whole populations or how those change i can observe certain things about the output behaviorally but then i have to infer a whole lot and so the total complexity of social science is way more complex way more variables and there's way more that i can't directly [1316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1316.559s)

measure right it is out it's not third person it's first person and second person and so that was absolutely an overstepping of the idea of what would fit into the rigorous domain of science and what the nature of the truth claims could be um so while it's true so yes it's true that there's a lot of [1336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1336.4s)

stuff that we have excessive certainty of that we shouldn't it's also true that we can overcompensate and pretend that we don't have uh the certainty on some things that we should and uh that there are not better epistemic processes even if none are perfect for coming to confidence in something so this question [1357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1357.12s)

of what is for a particular topic in that domain what is the appropriate epistemic process to come to us to relative confidence why do we think that it's that as opposed to something else and what are the axioms that we're drawing upon and how do those reify themselves and um what is an appropriate level of confidence and what is an appropriate process to come to that level of confidence to inform certain kinds of action right those are all kind of important questions now i'm i'm getting into this a little bit more formally than i thought we would and [1400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1400.64s)

um to get into the more probably daily practical stuff we'll get there in a moment and it might go beyond the course of what we can do in this uh short time but i wanted to say this thing about certainty and uncertainty is a mature relationship to certainty uh there's a rabbi friend of mine that actually first told me this so it came from that background but a [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1426.64s)

mature relationship to certainty is that we're comfortable having certainty where it is warranted knowing that it's never 100 but there might be 95 or 99 based on the total amount of data that we have relative to the total situation and we're also comfortable in uncertainty because if like the postmodernist [1446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1446.48s)

we're scared of certainty or uncomfortable with it or like on the other side we're uncomfortable with uncertainty both of those are biases that won't actually have us just think clearly so we want to be friends with uncertainty knowing that the unknown and actually the unknowable is a very large infinity [1464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1464.559s)

and then we also want to endeavor earnestly to gain the certainties that inform appropriate right action responsible right action where we can actually take responsibility to affect the things that we care about in the world so i don't want to be attached to that what i think is right but i do want to be attached to understanding reality as [1484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1484.48s)

clearly as i can so that i can act as effectively in service of the good so if i am working towards helping hunger and i work really diligently and earnestly and make no progress and more people are getting hungry i want to be able to say that i'm failing right like i it's it's very important and then i want to be able to say i [1505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1505.919s)

should do something different rather than continue doing that thing because i actually am result oriented here not just processor i actually care about the people getting fed or the chronovirus getting solved and so i want to make sure that the pro that my understanding of what's going on [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1522.08s)

that informs what i think would be effective that informs the things that i try that then i re test to see are they working is actually working okay that's all very basic but it's still worth kind of framing up um i think we can get into how does what are good tools of episemics but probably i think the place where maybe the most [1546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1546.0s)

value can be harvested the fastest is what are the most common places where people mess up like how do you you're probably [[sensemaking]] badly if yeah i think that would be helpful especially in this moment as we are all trying to make sense of this crisis and what it means and you know a lot of people in this course looking to like what is the opening that's being provided by all of this right and wanting to step into that without being tone deaf too i think it's a theme that a lot of us are looking into um and part of that is just making sense of what's happening yeah making the tragedy worse okay so with regard to that you know the tragedy worse is there an opening to make it better the better and worse are not what we'd normally think of as epistemic questions they're ethical or existential right like what is good and what is bad and but that's absolutely relevant so there's bias [1611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1611.2s)

there and let's speak to it so there is a bias that i notice really damaging people's [[sensemaking]] when it comes to coronavirus and it also damages their [[sensemaking]] regarding [[climate change]] and [[existential risk]] and kind of risk writ large i'm going to oversimplify on purpose to start the topic and knowing that i am oversimplifying [1633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1633.84s)

and we could get into a much richer discussion of it there are it's it's easy to have a bias that we could kind of flatly call a positivity bias that doesn't want things to be really bad like just doesn't want to believe that think that can't be with it doesn't want to feel it and [1657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1657.6s)

so wherever their people are claiming that is bad they're likely to think that it's probably alarmists those are probably people that are catastrophizing there's probably some good innovation that's going to come along that will solve it like they there's a before even researching it there is a immediate bias either to be [1676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1676.32s)

kind of almost aesthetically repulsed by it or to move away or to assume it's probably wrong or probably won't be the whole story whereas when evidence comes along and things are getting better or it's not that bad there's an instant resonance before doing a similar level of [[sensemaking]] it's like oh this is look see things are getting better and there's a kind of positivity bias that i think is actually worth having and a kind that isn't worth having the kind that biases our assessment of what is is terrible the kind that is committed to understanding what is very very clearly including all of the [1714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1714.48s)

negativities that are current and the negativities that could be the risks so that we are empowered to help make things better and the positivity bias is that i want my thought word indeed to all be working towards making things better which requires understanding what is that kind of positivity bias is great it's not messing up our [[sensemaking]] it's applying our [[sensemaking]] in an empowered and constructive way but i'm not going to be good at making things better if i'm not seeing what is clearly so there is a you know when you think of the term spiritual bypass but it can be a psychological bypass or a kind of epistemic bypass of any kind it's any [1753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1753.919s)

spiritual idea or philosophic idea or bias that wants us to not be with the some pain right so in the kind of spiritual bypass whether it's like well they reincarnated to have they incarnated to have those lessons or their soul chose this or there will be some silver [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1773.36s)

lining in it or god works in mysterious ways it's some way of being able to say i don't have to feel bad about this thing that otherwise i would feel really bad about because i don't feel like i can hold that or be with it which is kind of like a pseudo-sociopathy right one of the things about sociopaths [1793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1793.12s)

is that others can be hurting and they don't feel bad which is why they can hurt others and so any idea that makes us able to not feel bad in the pre in the presence of others feeling bad is taking beliefs that are moving us in the direction of a sociopathy-like set of behaviors so when i'm seeing people who are gasping [1815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1815.12s)

for air and dying in that way and their family members can't even be with them on their deathbed because they would get sick upset about it right and that it's unnecessary and they could have prevented that i'm super sad for them and i'm super mad at [1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1832.159s)

the people that are making choices that they for poor reasons that could have prevented it or done a better job and i don't i wouldn't want to feel any other way like there would be something wrong with me if i didn't feel those feelings it would mean that i like i had to be fractured inside [1852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1852.48s)

i'm speaking to this because i see this rampantly with people latching on to oh there's this new drug it looks like it's going to work before there's really good [[sensemaking]] that we know enough about the drug because they really want something that's going to work oh there's this great new diagnostic test oh there's this one epidemiologist [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1868.96s)

that said it's really not that bad oh look there's this thing that shows empty hospitals maybe it's really not that bad and they'll latch onto that ship before really studying it but reject the other which means that they won't be part of making things better so this is a very common bias and of course it goes without saying the exact [1887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1887.919s)

opposite bias is also common which is a catastrophism bias which is whenever there is something that looks like it uh could be that something isn't that bad or there might be a solution someone tends to think that it is probably going to fail and when they see anything that looks [1906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1906.08s)

like a possible risk they assume it's probably going to happen and they emotionally and it's it's like okay let's say we look at the situation today where the response to covet has started to damage the [[food supply]] that's a huge deal because messing up the [[food supply]] and wars and riots over [[food supply]] and insufficiencies of [[food supply]] whatever could kill a lot more people than the virus and that's a place where our response to the virus might be much worse than the virus itself and we it's a big deal so is there a big deal when you start messing up the [[food supply]] yes does that mean that [[food supply]] is already so messed up that it's inexorable that two billion people are going to starve no we can still totally do stuff about it but there are some people who i've talked with over the last couple days who've called me freaking out saying did you see like there are locusts in northern africa and the middle east and crops rotting in india we're losing the [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1962.0s)

[[food supply]] everybody's going to starve well it's true there are locusts in northern africa in the middle east and it's a big deal and crops are rotting in india it's not true that 2 billion people are going to starve it is true that they and but what's happening is that possib typically we want to do worst case scenario forecasting so we can prevent [1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1980.88s)

it because if you don't know that it could happen then you don't see what the escalation pathways are then you can't prevent it and but then if we prevent it the people the positivity bias will say see you were just catastrophists for doing that nothing bad really ever happens all that bad ever happened [1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=1996.72s)

it would have happened had we not done these things it only didn't happen because we did the worst case scenario planning and saw what it took to prevent it um so i want to do worst case scenario but know that it's a scenario it's not that it's already happened and then i want to see how to prevent it so i want the positivity to be oriented towards [2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2011.84s)

action not towards [[sensemaking]] um so does this make sense on positivity negativity bias and how they mess up our [[sensemaking]] mm-hmm definitely especially where there are high consequence high pain topics yeah yeah and it seems like there's just kind of this through line of um kind of like the ego getting in the [2032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2032.159s)

way of like people want to have the the bias towards certainty but a bias towards certainty kind of shows up in this way too intermingled with the positivity and the catastrophic bias of just people especially right now because everything's so up in the air people just want to have some grinding [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2051.44s)

you know and so i've seen in myself and in others just biased towards okay i want to make sense of this i want to know you know what's happening in what order with what time frame um and i think something that we've seen again in a through line through a lot of what we're learning is just like the world is [2070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2070.879s)

dynamic it's always shifting change is the only constant and so how can we kind of be more comfortable with not knowing exactly what's going to happen but be in that state of um i'm still widening our view still having like facing that with like a deeper [2090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2090.32s)

hunger for knowing as much as that we can yes and the deeper hunger that is not a hunger that jumps to false conclusions because we want them but it does the hard work that it takes to actually endeavor towards so you know i really want to know what you were just saying right i really [2109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2109.44s)

want to know what's going to happen what could happen what the right order of operation should be how we should tend to think that's i i'm working on knowing that stuff but i don't think that i can scroll my facebook feed and read for several hours and have a good sense of those things um it's kind of like i [2125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2125.28s)

want to be buff and i don't want to work out that part like it's just not going to work right this so there is an input output equation that has to happen and like being buff or being able to play the piano like being able to make sense of a topic takes the work that it takes and um so now this brings us to the next [2143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2143.52s)

bias well i can't do that much work because i'm not an expert in virology or an epidemiology or an immunology or a industrial sanitation engineer or in uh diagnostic medicine or in the privacy considerations for contact tracing or in macroeconomics or in domestic politics security or in the nature of [2169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2169.2s)

what's happening with geopolitical positioning or in [[supply chain|supply chains]] of food how the could i possibly know all that but there are authorities that know this so i'm going to defer to the authorities i'm going to cognitively offload that complexity now there is a bias in terms of how people relate to authority that's [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2184.88s)

important and it's similarly oversimplifying has a by some two directions both of which are bias which means not clear which is there are people that tend to think that most of the people who are in the primary authorized positions are probably trustworthy which would be a silly thing to think [2203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2203.359s)

and other people who assume that they're always untrustworthy and corrupt which is also a silly thing to think and those are very kind of sweeping generalizations that keep us from actually doing [[sensemaking]] because we're not looking at what are they actually saying what is the track record of where they've been right and wrong on this topic so far and historically [2221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2221.04s)

and where is there a divergence or a convergence of opinions of people and am i biasing towards some of them because of political association or because of positivity or negativity bias or things like that so can i find virologists that are saying oh this is not mutating in a way that's going to have a worse strain yes can i find other ones that are saying oh the next strain is probably going to be many times worse yes who are experts so how do i possibly make sense of this if i'm not a phd virologist and there are eminent ones who disagree you know pretty intensively and on every topic we can say something like that right well you actually can this is the nice thing is that the the you have the benefit of being able to look at where experts are converging where they're also diverging and what the basis of the divergence is and possibly having less bias than them because you didn't get a nobel prize saying this thing where you have an ego [2281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2281.2s)

invested in defending this particular thing and you don't have research grants that need to believe in this thing and you haven't had all of your attention in this one part of the picture where this virologist is looking at this this one's looking at this one's looking at this you can have an epistemic flexibility that can look at those and [2294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2294.88s)

also look at what the nature of the bias they might be running is and try to get some parallax across those and so um but on this one about authoritarian versus anti-authoritarian bias this is one of the most common things that i see that messes up everyone's [[sensemaking]] so there is a meme complex you can see all over the facebook say which is i'm tired of  tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists talking nonsense and armchair epidemiologists this is the place for experts if john hopkins in the cdc say if that's what's true nobody else should be weighing in [2340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2340.0s)

on this would we should listen to the things they say and empower the experts on this and vaccines work and i don't want to hear anything else about it and um whatever the authorities think are appropriate measures are the things that we should do right and that everything else is gruesomely irresponsible [2355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2355.76s)

and then of course we also hear this other meme plex that all of the authorities were completely corrupt for various vested interest purposes and we can't believe any of them and everything that they're telling you is false and and i think both of these are pretty close to equally gibberish yeah you know hanlon's razor is a [2374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2374.64s)

philosophical razor that's like don't attribute to malice what can be adequately attributed to ignorance yeah and i think so many of us you know yeah our trust has been broken in however many ways and then we like think you know they are out to get us um i think it can be a waste of precious [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2394.64s)

human brilliance it's a ways of thinking okay so there's very strong bias in both directions when it comes to conspiracies conspiracy are there times where some people conspire meaning share information with each other that they don't publicly share to advance particular agendas that if publicly shared wouldn't work all the time like that is the nature of the world now does and so like for every watergate and enron there's a million of those that are not publicly caught but like that's what machiavelli told everyone to do that's what sun tzu and the 36 stratagems that's what military theory and political theory is all about right how do you conspire with some in group to advance a particular agenda in against out groups and anyone who'd get in the way of and when you look at genghis khan and napoleon alexander the great when you look at the barbarism of the 12th century we're genetically those people still we have the same brains and the same [2453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2453.52s)

hormones like we're not that different we have just like we we're more civil in some ways we also just hide it better so you know our lovely previous democrat president we bombed a lot of civilians to death in the middle east with the largest military the world's ever known um but it wasn't here right and [[factory farm|factory farms]] are as brutal as anything has ever been and their mass scale and most people contribute to it financially they're paying other people to do their dirty wet works for them and then feeling civilized um and so we should not wrongly assume that we are more civilized than we are and that there is not a ton of [2495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2495.92s)

malice or even just having accepted that that's the nature of the world and you know rationalized ladder climbing in politics we also shouldn't assume that every time that there's something that doesn't make sense that it is highly coordinated malice because coordination is actually fairly hard and [2515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2515.599s)

very often it is just incompetence and or the nature of the incentive systems so assuming any of those things means you aren't thinking if you're assuming it's probably ignorance you aren't thinking and you aren't paying attention you're bringing your own bias into it if you're assuming that the authorities are probably well intentioned or they're probably not you [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2535.2s)

are not thinking and so this is what i want people to notice in their bias is what things tend to bother them there are a lot of people where if it comes from an authoritative claim they're just bothered off the bat or if it sounds conspiratorial they're bothered off the bat this is not good [[sensemaking]] or there's something that's a rule of thumb like you just mentioned that they take as if it was almost absolute like they apply it kind of uh feverishly what i'm wanting is for people it's like ecclesiastes a time to kill and a time to heal and to sew in to reap there's a time for every epistemic tool like there's a pla there's a place where they all [2572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2572.48s)

apply and so what you want to do is go into a situation and say maybe malice is happening here maybe simply incentives and politics are maybe incompetences maybe it's actually being handled brilliantly and my overall assessment of why something handled brilliantly is wrong i don't know and i don't know just [2589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2589.52s)

because it's an authority or just because it's a wealthy person or a whatever or just because it is part of trump or you know the people who are against trump if trump happens to like hydroxychloroquine no one should automatically like hydroxychloroquine more or less because trump happened to say it because the fact that he happened to say it has nothing to  do with whether it works or not and obviously trump didn't just pull hydroxychloroquine out of thin air some doctors and scientists told him some data about that now so we should actually look at the data on that very closely and carefully [2626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2626.0s)

during the obama administration and all the administration since nixon washington dc primarily ran what they called the benign china hypothesis china's not trying to become a world empire and you know free trade with them and blah blah and you know we started hearing trump china china china china and [2650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2650.0s)

people being upset that there he was wanting to do certain kinds of uh tariffs or trade war type things or whatever but being concerned about what the uh chinese geopolitical agendas were he was right he was actually right the benign china hypothesis was gibberish if you read the hundred year war uh and you look at the activities of [2672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2672.96s)

chinese communist party there's absolutely global agendas it would be silly to think otherwise now he wasn't right out of nowhere he was right because bannon and others happened to give him insight there and it happened to resonate with that as just kind of a deal maker kind of guy when he sat across from them [2694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2694.96s)

he probably had the sense of like oh  it feels like these guys are playing some pretty serious game that i some some go game that i don't feel well set up for now he's been wrong about a gazillion things and so again wanting to over norm that he's wrong and stupid and evil about [2712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2712.96s)

everything or right and the savior on everything is not thinking now of course it's fine if i'm trying to sense make there might be some people who are right often enough that i look to them as sources of higher signal lower noise up front but i still check and there might be other people that even though they've been right a couple [2729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2729.28s)

times i assume it's probably low signal enough that i generally don't check but i can't generalize on that in consequential areas so hydroxychloroquine i'm going to use this because this is a very good example of where [[sensemaking]] is tricky where it's consequential [2746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2746.48s)

so hydroxychloroquine is a anti-malarial primarily but it also has antiviral properties has been used as an antiviral and is used in rheumatology uh heavily for rheumatic conditions it's a drug that's been used for many decades very heavily since vietnam the united states military has put most u.s soldiers on it before they [2769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2769.04s)

deploy to areas that have malaria as a malarial prophylaxis so before they go to every week for the first four years of my life because they lived in ivory coast yeah exactly and um so we have a pretty enormous amount of data on the long-term effects and the safety and the whatever [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2793.599s)

of hydroxychloroquine is it a totally benign drug no it's not vitamin c uh it can absolutely affect hearts this thing called the qt interval uh it's contraindicated with some meds in some conditions but do we at least understand the contraindications in the general safety profile well especially as a old generic [2811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2811.44s)

drug that has been around forever and been in combination with all the other drugs and has a generally pretty good safety profile relative to advanced coveted infections yes do we have randomized control trials that show that it's effective placebo can you know double-blind placebo-controlled multi-location type of thing no those are slow those take a long time to do now those are awesome like randomized control trials are totally a good sense-making tool an epistemic tool but there are a bunch of people who have been taught that it is the only tool that exists to make sense of pharmacology which is utter nonsense [2846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2846.8s)

that means that those people are not actually making good sense of the world or thinking they are they've been drilled in this kind of uh over norming on one tool because it happens to be a lovely tool when we can do it and it also happens to be the one that the fda wants and so it also happens to be the one that you better take if you want a [2865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2865.92s)

maximum security position to have your malpractice not get you in trouble so this is another source of bias on it right what is the maximally defensible position is also a major thing okay by the time the randomized control trials are done heaps of people will be dead and icus will be overwhelmed and case fatality [2886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2886.8s)

rate will have spiked precipitously so should we give people drugs that might be more dangerous and not effective just based on um pendulum dowsing no but are there ways of making sense of something to enough degree to affect some kind of action yes so with regard to hydroxychloroquine i'll use [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2907.68s)

this as an example there were randomized control trials for it in sars sarge cove one right that's meaningful it's a different virus this a novel virus but there's a lot of similarities in mechanisms there were randomized control trials for it and other viruses including other [2930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2930.4s)

coronaviruses there have been in vitro trials on that are very effective on this one on starzqv2 and there are a lot of non-randomized control trials but open label trials ones in china one's in south korea one's in france the one in new york but then heaps of doctors that are using it that are not nothing right they're not [2955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2955.04s)

placebo controlled but they're not nothing now there are some things that just placebos don't really affect right placebos don't do a good job of healing broken bones um and so we don't need placebo controls for things that don't really produce placebo effects and so placebos don't kill viruses now [2976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=2976.64s)

do placebos modulate your immune system to some degree sure right but is there an amount of effectiveness that placebos have on viral conditions statistically so you can remove that statistical artifact and then be able to still look at is their uh effect beyond this just statistical artifact so that's like a way of saying hey we can actually kind of make sense of this here factoring placebo considerations even if we're not doing the placebo control trial um so we brought a group of doctors together a group of mds to work on doing a literature review of hydroxychloroquine and by itself and in conjunction with zinc and azithromycin and doxycycline and other things like that and we looked at the mechanistic trials in vitro trials the animal trials the current open label trials previous ones and we were looking at preponderance of data and looking at relative benefit to risk in different populations that's actually [3032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3032.64s)

trying to do [[sensemaking]] with all of the available data factoring the consequence of action and inaction now i don't get malpractice lawsuits for inaction in the same way i get them for action so that ends up being a source of bias and a cya you know cover your ass kind of way that is different than just trying to [3048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3048.4s)

sense make how do i save the most lives and so i know doctors many of them who i've spoke with in the last few days who gave themselves prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine for themselves and their family and said this is absolutely what i do with myself and my family based on all the literature but i'm not allowed to prescribe it at my hospital because the hospital said we would be [3068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3068.559s)

fired for prescribing it because uh for outpatient treatment because of those concerns that hospital policy i believe is gruesomely negligent and life-saving now are we suggesting that people drink fish bowl cleaner obviously not are we suggesting that people prescribe  to themselves no [3089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3089.92s)

that you don't look at heart conditions and comorbidities no of course not what we're saying is should prescribing physicians who've taken a hippocratic oath and who are scientifically literate people be given emergency authorization to be able to prescribe as they see fit based on the current literature and preponderance of data for life-saving [3112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3112.24s)

purposes yeah i think that's a good emergency authorization um where they're not worried about getting fired or malpractice things so that they can actually be focused on doing the right thing here now again with regard to hydroxychloroquine there's pretty good evidence that in [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3128.559s)

late stage infection it doesn't help very much but there are very few antivirals that help in late stage infection in the entire corpus of medicine and the general rule of thumb with infection as a whole is treat early rather than late because once it gets bad it's much much harder but especially [3149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3149.119s)

with viruses is that only in the very beginning do you have meaningful chance so a lot of people know if you get shingles or if you get herpes a cyclovir can help if you get to it within 24 hours at most 48 hours after that we'll do almost nothing in that time it does a lot if you're in late stage aids the [3168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3168.16s)

cocktail antiviral cocktail doesn't help that much if you're in very early stage it will prevent disease progression so if you do a randomized control trial for hydroxychloroquine or even the open label trials or fda provisional emergency approval for late stage as an antiviral when [3188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3188.24s)

pretty much no antivirals work late stage and then you assume what that means about the drug writ large and factoring for early stage that would just be silly that would be going against the preponderance of knowledge we have about viral mechanisms and antivirals writ large so the randomized control trials should [3205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3205.92s)

be for early stage right which is kind of akin to like how we've been testing people we've only been testing we predominantly have been testing the very sick rather than random sampling and so we don't really have a good idea of what the denominator is correct so we do need background random testing [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3223.119s)

for epidemiological forecasting and being able to think about herd immunity and inoculating with less virulent forms of the virus and other things like that but stand on this one for a moment so one should we wait for randomized control trials to be able to make sense of something no [3241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3241.92s)

we should look at the preponderance of all of the data the risk and the reward think about different populations of risk sensitivity and comorbidities and whatever differently and be able to actually apply all of the [[sensemaking]] we have to the scenario and know that the [[sensemaking]] we would do if we had all the time in [3258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3258.72s)

the world is different than the [[sensemaking]] we would do when there is consequence to inaction which is why i said we have to have the right relationship to certainty and uncertainty on the basis to come to it factoring the consequentiality of action and inaction now would we like to do randomized control trials to get more knowledge of [3276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3276.72s)

course should we be doing them late stage only well if we want let's say i wanted to and i'm not ascribing malice where it is very likely ignorance but if i wanted to do an information warfare tactic to prove that trump was wrong in an idiot or [3293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3293.92s)

to make a generic drug like hydroxychloroquine that nobody can make much money on seem ineffective so some patented drug can make a lot of money or whatever if i wanted to do that i would set up a late stage trial that showed that it wasn't effective and then over generalize those results across the board and i would also [3311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3311.04s)

set up a late stage trial where the placebo is vitamin c which one of the major studies is doing right now where vitamin c is widely known to be an effective antiviral and then i get [[plausible deniability]] that i'm doing good science because it comes from a prestigious university when what i'm really doing is info warfare to an advance an agenda [3326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3326.559s)

so um now we start to get into i struggled through watching this david ike thing the other day it was very painful there was extraordinarily little signal in it not none but very very little conspiratorial stuff that said so hong kong had almost nobody die because of good response [3352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3352.72s)

and south korea didn't respond quite as quickly but they responded well still very few deaths okay well they're littler places islands um whatever well germany is not an island it's not a little place and their cfr is extremely low czech republic extremely vietnam poor poorer relative country doing great [3375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3375.52s)

well some of those asian ones had sars so they were prepared czech republic didn't germany didn't um those are both landlocked they aren't islands those are you know democracies not dictatorships could we just not have responded better well we allowed 430 000 people to fly from china since the thing happened to the united states because border closing is xenophobic no it's not we're closing the border to viruses that happen to be on people from wherever the  they came from close the border to them coming from an european country if that's where they're coming from so this is now a place similarly where if somebody jumps to [3416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3416.96s)

the problem is xenophobia or racism they're not [[sensemaking]] again we should absolutely shut borders during pandemics where viral transmission is like physically transmitted you should shut borders between counties within states where there's very highly different distributions of it within the counties to be able to [3433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3433.68s)

prevent excessive spread just like you are we're stopping the transmission between people and people even within the same city right um so is it possible that all of the profound getting everything wrong that we have done the who until a few weeks ago telling people not to wear [3453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3453.119s)

masks and ppe and whatever that that's all just stupidity and incompetence well that would be impressive it would be impressive is it possible that there are some agendas where if things get worse they do better well if the eu that's already under a lot of tension gets more tension because some countries get in other countries that could [3474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3474.88s)

help them aren't helping them because they only have enough to help themselves it kind of breaks eu apart so that the eu can't bring in the eastern european countries because russia wants the baltic states would russia have the goal to do information warfare kinds of tactics to get the baltic states back i don't have to say they are doing this to say everything in the precedent of [3491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3491.92s)

unrestricted warfare in the history of how these things happen says that they would of course have that orientation is the way that china would be trying to do the belt and road initiative take advantage of the fact that they're the only supplier of ppe and on the other side of this and the groups will sign the bottom line on [3508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3508.16s)

things that have fine print that they wouldn't have otherwise if they're going to die at the plague and you know and similarly if there are groups that want increased surveillance capacity so this why should we trust the authorities carte blanche no that would be silly should we assume that they're all [3525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3525.76s)

corrupt and controlled by reptilians no that would be silly should we actually try to do [[sensemaking]] on each specific thing itself rather than do this over generalized thing that unfortunately we can't do in this particular world of cognitive offloading yes that's what we have to do so with hydroxychloroquine we can see [3545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3545.04s)

okay late stage versus early stage is this really a placebo or is this not a placebo it randomized control trials are desirable are they the only thing uh mechanistic studies other viruses what can you tell from another virus to a novel virus um what degree of certainty would be needed based on the consequentiality [3569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3569.359s)

these are all examples and there's like a dozen more i haven't got into of epistemics you would want to think through to know how to make sense of this and that you should favorite ways like there's bayesian decision theory like there's different ways to kind of make sense of things with probability [3589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3589.599s)

and um yeah do you have favorite tools that you like to use i'm upset at the idea of favorite tools each of them it's like i'm going to build a house with a screwdriver screwdrivers are awesome tools that you come back to often all of them and for the things they're good at so [[network theory]] and graph theory are the best things for the thing that they do and probability and statistics and different statistical tools mathematics in the domain that it's for computer modeling agent-based modeling you know machine deep learning on large data sets first principles thinking in the place where first principles thinking applies [3629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3629.359s)

bayesian analytics where that applies you know crowdsourcing versus expert sourcing um when do we use induction and deduction and abduction favorite tool intellectually is as silly as favorite tool to try and fix a car or build a house yeah i like wrenches to fix a car [3649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3649.2s)

awesome they talk to screwdrivers and they suck for welding and so if someone actually wants to be able to fix a car you got to have a lot of tools know how to use them and know which one to use for which situation and if someone wants to make sense of the world same thing and if that seems like too much [3668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3668.24s)

then you should just accept the idea you probably won't understand the nature of the reality you live in and be able to make good choices yeah so well within that it kind of like it helped i mean it brings up people's biases of like wanting certainty and wanting um yeah both positivity and certainty [3688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3688.48s)

come up for in that just like oh can't you just explain it to me in canada i'll just be okay i've been taught over and over again as like an okay response to the world well this is the psychology of a child that wants a parent to be able to depend upon yeah um and it's actually interesting [3708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3708.64s)

i don't want to over norm here i don't want to do bad sense make an over normal topic that is super complex but i will draw a parallel that has at least some truth value the way people related to their parents as kids often reflects itself somewhat in the bias they have towards authorities later their parents and teachers and whatever [3732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3732.4s)

other authorities in childhood so the people that did better in school and did better with their parents and kind of did well with the standard model more often than the other crew will tend to think that the standard model is well and think that the current authorities are probably trustworthy and good and the people that didn't do well at those things [3754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3754.72s)

and didn't have trustworthy authorities are more likely to have that generalized sense right that's not an absolute it can come from lots of other things later life events but those are interesting things to look at and it's also interesting where it's like i want someone to just reassure me that everything will be okay [3771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3771.68s)

how old is the psychology having that thought i don't know what's going on and i feel scared how old is that okay so now we need to do therapy for inner child trauma stuff that is going to hijack our adult brain being able to make sense of the world and that will make us susceptible to other people being able to [3788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3788.559s)

influence us more than they should yeah and dangerous authorities and whatever start to come into is they can prey upon that yeah and i think one of the root causes of so many of our our interdependent crises right now is that kind of avoidance of that inner work avoidance of it being even okay to talk about those things [3812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3812.319s)

you know um i mean it seems like there's a trend towards you know being okay with therapy or coaching as kind of like a therapy like tool that people are becoming more um yeah it's just it's less stigmatized than it once was people realize that their effective choice making requires effective [3838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3838.0s)

understanding about both the nature of the world and what the effect of a particular choice or injunction is going to be then wanting to sense make clearly becomes a very high goal and once they realize that a lot of the bad [[sensemaking]] comes from psychological predispositions biases that come from those places [3854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3854.64s)

then psychological work actually becomes part of [[sensemaking]] so do you know as much as i might want to learn math or statistics or bayesian analysis i might also want to be able to do bias assessment and be able to see where those biases arise from and clear them yeah so this moment that we're in is an opening [3880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3880.799s)

for a healing at a lot of different levels and one of those is i'm finding as people are in stressed situations some of their kind of unaddressed trauma is arising and i think similarly kind of like our unaddressed root causes of you know what's creating the ecological crisis and and [[climate change]] and everything um yeah there's an opening right now for us to see right like the the true meaning of apocalypse is an unveiling of a greater truth that was that was unapparent before that moment happened um so yeah curious to hear what you think of kind of all of that incense making and [3923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3923.119s)

in this moment i'm gonna share something that i have to share a dialectic of things for it to make sense so where people notice that there is a psychological process that seems more like a child than an adult psychological process i want to be reassured i want to be comforted i don't know what's going on i [3948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3948.079s)

want to know that an authority is taking care of it or can tell me what's true anything that they do from there will not help if they're trying to act on the world if they're sharing information or whatever so the only thing they can do from there is actually respond to this address their own psychology until they come to a more empowered [3975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3975.44s)

place and then from a more empowered place try to sense make the world and then act from clear [[sensemaking]] don't act from those places um so i really want to see people showing up in a adult way but the dialectic with that is you can't just snap your fingers and get there because [3997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=3997.92s)

you want to there's work that it takes if the if there are unresolved child trauma type things that keep hijacking you into that state pretending that that's not the case and saying oh yes i feel very calm and centered and i'm speaking like an adult i'm freaking out inside whatever [4013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4013.2s)

like then you're just schisming yourself and so i want to see people showing up as an adult and that means i want to see them seeing where they aren't and doing what it takes to actually get there rather than pretend and where they aren't there i don't want them to have shame about it but i also don't want them acting on the world from [4031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4031.119s)

that place i want them acting on themselves and then i want them acting on the world when they're in the right place to act on the world i want us supporting each other in this if you see somebody sharing information and trying to act on the world from a place that doesn't seem actually clear that might be propagating [4048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4048.16s)

problems then lovingly try to support them to recenter neither add to it nor attack them because that's not going to help right just try to lovingly help them recenter and be open to when others do that with you in fact ask for it seeking the counsel of people who you consider wise counsel is a sign of wisdom itself um now with regard to traumas coming up to heal right now yes and this is another thing so i want people to show up as adults and that takes whatever it takes right so people if people are at home and they have extra free time maybe this is the time they can be doing [4095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4095.119s)

skype therapy sessions and they can be reading the things and doing the meditation and doing the journaling that they've wanted to do that'd be great we it's either a solitary confinement or an ostrom right like it can be this great mental health crisis where we get a huge amount of benzo addictions that just ruin everything [4114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4114.08s)

for a long time or a uh emergence into people going deeper into their own wholeness together and with each other uh now we want to work on which of those it is for ourself and with our communities and with the world as best we can the same with the educational crisis this can be the generation of kids that [4134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4134.64s)

all got no education for some time and had upset parents traumatizing the out of them at in a small place or where we actually reinvent schooling in a much better way in education because we need to so in all these ways the same with health care the same with the food security system the same with our risk prevention system the same with macroeconomics it can either get much worse or we can use this catalyst to make things much better to be able to do the larger macro things we have to be in the right place to be capacitated to do that so we work on that first and then the other and it's somewhat you know ongoingly back and forth as needed in addition to i would like people to [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4174.4s)

show up as adults where it is possible being able to show up in a way that is calm and clear and grounded and not biasing towards seeing things as better or worse than they are but very clearly and then biasing towards how to make things better effectively the people who can do that are the people who will lead the solutions and [4196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4196.96s)

other people will look to but you can't pretend you've got to do what it takes to actually have that happen and this image of the coal pressurizes into diamonds by pressure by intensive pressure right or the steel becomes hard through the temperature of the forging process and [4217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4217.199s)

the banging on it right so as there's increased pressure we can either have it fracture us or turn the coal into diamond where we become clearer and more crystalline and precise and and to have that as a frame that as the pressure gets more i actually go slower clearer more grounded just even as an [4238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4238.48s)

intention can be helpful yeah that's really beautiful um yeah i forget his name bio i think it depends his last name he says that times are urgent slow down um yeah it's really important and counterintuitive and you know um i think yeah just overall [4265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4265.6s)

kind of this this appetite for bias and really understanding it is yeah a powerful outcome of this time as we're all trying to ground in the healthiest way possible u.s special forces has this uh statement and there's a lot of versions of this [4289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4289.679s)

perennially but slow is smooth and smooth is fast and it's not saying go slow when urgent action is needed it's saying go fast but mistakes aren't fast mistakes end up being super super slow doing doing like you're trying to clean the kitchen so fast before guests come and you break glasses and now you gotta take the time to clean it up and it's [4310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4310.64s)

way slower than had you moved a little bit slower so you don't want to break right you don't want to spread misinformation you don't want to act on this information so you got to go slow enough to go smooth where each step is actually a right step and gets to build on right steps [4324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4324.8s)

which is actually the very fastest thing you can possibly do so i'm actually encouraging people to go fast but actually fast which means clear smooth right yeah yeah um wonderful we're we're approaching the end of our time here i feel um we covered a lot [4347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4347.6s)

of principles and and biases and just a lot of insight is there anything else you would offer one thing we're asking people is are there any vocabulary terms that people can insert into their you know daily or weekly use that would enable them to kind of kind of upgrade their their ability to make sense of the world there's certain things that you unfortunately though this is not absolutely the case the community of practice that in general looks at critical thinking and logical fallacies and they're the ones that look at bias the most or very very frequently in terms of cognitive bias that whole field in my opinion admits a certain bias [4396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4396.88s)

which is kind of funny which is that it is biasing towards analysis over synthesis so it wants to make sure that it's not having any wrong ideas and it rejects wrong ideas but it's not necessarily making sure that the very partial reductionist ideas are being put together in good overarching frameworks which is the [4418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4418.88s)

synthesis side so it there is a need for synthetic thought and creative thought as well as very analytic thought and so the the tools of critical thinking generally help you with the analytic thought more and so those are necessary but they're not sufficient and there are places where they're rules [4440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4440.0s)

of thumb that are not true they're rules of thumb so like the uh occam's razor right sometimes the thing that is true actually is more complicated than you know the hypothesis than something else so it's just a general kind of razor just for those who don't know is like the simplest solution to something with [4460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4460.719s)

the less variables is more likely to be true yeah and and we might say that statistically that is often the case but it also even depends upon the scenario like the simple economic models are always really wrong and the simple biological models are always really wrong because the causation is actually complex so [4482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4482.56s)

really depends on the domain so uh in terms of terms i think people just going and looking up epistemology and reading the wikipedia page or the oxford philosophy page and just kind of having a basic sense is good uh looking up and then if you want to do the wikipedia rabbit hole thing [4504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4504.64s)

so it'll if it mentions bayesian analysis take it take a little trip down there and maybe go watch a couple youtube videos on bayesian analysis and on [[network theory]] on graph theory on statistics on learning basics things about statistics on as you're hearing the terms epidemiology and [4520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4520.56s)

virology and immunology so much maybe just read the wikipedia page to start like do i know what a virus is do i actually know what rna is what's the difference between rna and dna do i i'm hearing pcr and serological and immunological do i know what the words mean how about i just look up the words that i'm hearing especially before i use them [4537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4537.12s)

yeah um that and i don't have to read a textbook let's read a wikipedia page to at least have a beginning sentence which will actually help humble you because you'll realize that there was much more that you didn't even know that you didn't know about and then you'll probably as you know more actually be more humble in your [4554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4554.4s)

presentation than you knew less and just repeated a word so okay in terms of words i would suggest every word that you're hearing it seems important that you're tempted to say again look it up first yeah awesome yeah and kind of we ask every i guess lecturer to come up with an [4576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4576.08s)

activity i feel like that could be a good one is starting with epistemol uh epistemology go down a rabbit hole and kind of see where you go and see what you learn any other kind of guide posts along the way as people are going down that journey that they can should consider in terms of doing good [[sensemaking]] not just starting with the epistemology page but starting with anything on covid you're reading or looking at make a list of all the terms that you don't know what they mean fully and go read about them and then follow those rabbit holes um super valuable and just a super simple thing [4618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4618.239s)

we are creating the information ecology for each other the [[epistemic commons]] for each other and just like it's not good to throw trash on the ground and pollute because of shared space and the effects it's not good to put trash information out it pollutes the information ecology so before you share something you remember there was this this early [4639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4639.28s)

greek that held his thumb up to the moon closed one eye and said at arm's length my thumb exactly blocks out the moon therefore the moon is the size of my thumb and my palm can block out the sun therefore the sun must be the size of my palm and i don't know if that's a true story [4659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4659.199s)

it's a story that is told in plushy sometimes uh and if you didn't know that depth perception was a thing that affected size it's a rational argument right where the axiom is that distance doesn't affect relative perception of size right it's not understanding the nature of a visual [4676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4676.96s)

cone it's a rational argument that's gibberish very easy to have rational arguments that are gibberish because they have wrong axioms or missing something it's entirely possible that you read something that makes sense to you because there's a rational argument and it makes sense everywhere [4697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4697.52s)

that the virus has been bad their 5g was recently installed and everywhere there's 5g the virus is bad oh and 5g just got pushed through oh well go fact check that first just look at a map of all the places that 5g is and then look at a place a map of the places that the virus is and see if the claim made [4723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4723.679s)

is true before you share it because it's not in that particular case and so just because something sounds compelling and it seems maybe plausible upon first blush doesn't mean that it's true and but if you put it out even if you say what do you guys think of this because you didn't want to do the hard work of making sense of it lots of other [4752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4752.08s)

people who don't want to do the hard work of making sense of it will be compelled the way that you were and it starts to affect background thought you're actually polluting the information ecology you're throwing styrofoam your intellectual styrofoam into the ocean right and so just don't do that um [4765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4765.44s)

and at least do enough research to see that it's if something is probably not grounded and then if you don't know how to go further then do an adequate preface i looked into this here's what i could find here's what i couldn't find i'm really trying to figure this out does anyone have good data on such and such and then tag the people that you think [4783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4783.44s)

are probably the people who might be able to figure it out right start smaller instead of polluting a whole wider landscape yeah yeah i think that makes a lot of sense and just like i think people yeah going to like primary source you know just being having an appetite for doing our own research [4802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4802.32s)

i think so many people have become accustomed to just getting information from other people who've already done the synthesis and kind of going back to a couple points ago you were saying there's a lot of a lot of kind of analysis oriented tools and not as many synthesis um tools or rules of thumb or or [4822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4822.239s)

yeah work in that realm how can people kind of balance that out for themselves so this thing that is often attributed and quoted to einstein talking about imagination being as important or more important than intellect and creativity and those types of thinking or intuition right so there was this process that einstein had where he would be working on the math on the chalkboard or on the paper until he hit a diminishing return and he just wasn't making progress and then he would take a break and he'd go puff his pipe and look at the clouds and kind of zone out or play his violin kind of zone out [4867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4867.6s)

and then at a certain point in the zoning out and i deal with pop and then you go back with that idea to the white board and work on it so now i'm going to say a metaphor for what's happening neurologically that we don't know is actually how neurology works but and so i'm specifying that this is not a absolute mechanistic [4892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4892.239s)

statement it's a metaphor so that there is this kind of left hemispheric more serial more analytic process and then there is a more right hemispheric more parallel more synthetic process and the corpus callosum has a largely inhibitory or shunting process between those and that the analytic process [4917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4917.04s)

actually has to shut off for a little while for the synthetic process so the analytic is this axioms these data these logical transforms this because this because this therefore this syllogistically right and the other one is a pattern analysis of look for everything like this and then uh aha that seems to come out of nowhere we might think of his [4936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4936.159s)

intuition but it didn't come out of nowhere it's just that process doesn't happen consciously in the same way because it's actually beyond the bandwidth of the conscious mind and that that then can give a new insight but we don't take it as absolute truth we then have to plug it back into the other process and see how it works [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4952.56s)

but then once you hit diminishing return there go back to this one and i think it was wigner might have been teller but i think it was wigner who about the physicist the great physicist who developed modern physics said we all knew that in terms of raw horsepower von neumann was the smartest like he could just figure out he [4972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4972.88s)

could do the math faster than any of us it was obvious but for all of his cleverness einstein still was the one with the deepest insights and some reason for that it wasn't just straight clock speed it was something else right um so i would say there is the study read fact check and then also [4994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=4994.88s)

go let yourself have that in mind don't distract onto the laundry list or whatever and then meditate look at the clouds zone out and then see what ideas come and journal those down and then go back right let yourself kind of have both of those processes and then find the facts as best you can and then also step back and consciously [5018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5018.88s)

try to put them together what kind of overarching picture or narratives or whatever might make sense but be careful because it might not be a simple narrative it might be lots of overlapping ones right but try to see would this overarching kind of frame make sense of lots of these and then say well if that was if this [5039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5039.92s)

narrative was true what else would be true and go look to see is that there or not what would falsify or verify this narrative or this hypothesis or kind of overarching structural frame um so yeah those are some things that's good it's really helpful what other offerings [5062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5062.4s)

or ways can people continue to engage with you i think you shared these there are these couple videos we did with rebel wisdom they called them the war on [[sensemaking]] uh it was basically we're here we're sharing tools of [[sensemaking]] there we were more sharing tools of propaganda that are [5084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5084.08s)

commonly used in the media landscape that mess up your [[sensemaking]] to be able to recognize them so you won't be wrongly affected by them the intention of those videos was to kind of inoculate people against um bad [[sensemaking]] those are worth checking out and uh then if if you want follow me on facebook i don't post public stuff very often but i if i do i post it there and uh podcasts and other stuff some of it historically is on uh civilizationemerging.com but it's not very updated um facebook's probably the best place i find that the the earnestness and the curiosity comes from something that you could think of as a spiritual impulse there is like actually a reverence for reality that wants to understand it there is a respect for and uh yeah there's a respect for the integrity of reality and a reverence that wants to and it's almost like if you have a lover and you really want to love them [5157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5157.44s)

well you want to know their childhood stories and what they love in their favorite color flower and their favorite songs and whatever so that you can actually love them well and it doesn't mean that you'll ever fully know them you shouldn't ever think that but that you want to know them better as an expression of the love that's there and [5173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5173.6s)

so and that's not the only thing you want you don't just want to know them you also want to have union with them you also want to serve them right well the same is true with reality writ large where you want to seek to understand it not that you will ever understand it completely but the desire to understand more as a kind of [5191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5191.92s)

cognitive or intellectual closeness or intimacy with reality it's a sign of a certain respect and reverence and love and there's something just profoundly beautiful in that and it's also and that's where it's motivated by what you just call pure desire to know or pure learning but where it's motivated by the desire to make a difference in the world i i would like these people not to be dying i'd like to have a solution that doesn't create an authoritarian state because i care about freedoms that then also is i want to understand reality enough to be effective motivated by my love for people for [5225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5225.52s)

nature for reality and my desire to serve so the basis of where the energy to do the work comes from is actually love and the deep the more you deepen your love and care the more energy you will have to do the work that it takes to have that love and care be active and manifest in serving that which is loved and cared about that's beautiful thank you um yeah i've been talking with a couple people lately of like what is the the contagion of love you know that we can kind of match this moment with as so many are feeling so much fear um and i love yeah the the idea that that love can [5272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5272.08s)

get reverenced and we get you know more and more understanding and curiosity and um yeah it's it's kind of an antidote to kind of like the fear and shutdown that a lot of people are in right now it's like a love and yeah the curiosity and the invitational tone of this all uh is a really lovely antibody sort of moment there there's a little [5298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5298.239s)

thing i'd like to offer here so something a good philosopher friend of mine shared with me that was very profound is um fear is not the opposite of love fear is a reaction to love it is sourced in it i can only be afraid of something being harmed that i don't want to have be harmed that i care about and so when people are totally apathetic [5326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5326.56s)

ready to commit suicide don't feel fear around dying don't feel fear around hurting other people whatever because there is no love or care that is binding them still if i and let's say i i don't feel any fear over something being destroyed i don't care about them like it let it burn down so the fear is a response to [5347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5347.04s)

something i love and care about where i'm thinking about it getting harmed in the future i'm afraid of going crazy i it's because i actually love life and my own ability to be sane and to connect and contribute and to take care of my family and to experience whatever it is right like there's actually a [5367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5367.199s)

value a reverence on that now the fear might be a unconscious response i'm not consciously saying i would like to get afraid now so it's an unconscious response and it might be a disempowered or disempowering response but it still derives its energy from the depth of what is cared about so i can do a conscious and empowering [5386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5386.96s)

response instead where i say oh i care about this thing so instead of focusing on automatically unconsciously what the bad outcome is going to be and feeling like i can't do anything so i just get afraid what is the good outcome i would like and what can i do about it so i get empowered in that so i move the fearful to careful [5404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5404.639s)

full of care right and act from there anger also comes from love sadness also does the apathy would just be like it i'm not angry not and so they might all be unconscious i'm not choosing to feel that they might all be disempowering or empowering but you can [5425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5425.04s)

find conscious and empowering where the anger becomes more like passion and the sadness becomes more like depth of appreciation and gratitude and fear becomes more like carefulness and proactivity but any of those emotions don't think of them as bad think of them as signals of something that is cared about [5444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5444.8s)

and then trace it back to what is it that i actually love and care about and then what is it that i want to have happen and how can i actually be empowered towards it beautiful yeah i had a realization a couple of months ago of instead of washing away fear seeing i was sitting on the side of a river um seeing it as a [5463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5463.679s)

stepping stone and the other side of the river being bravery um i'm seeing it as yeah the logical response but i love it interwoven with love yeah and that fearful careful play on words is very evocative thank you so much for your time and for all of this wisdom [5485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5485.04s)

um yeah really looking forward to seeing the conversation that it incites in our trim tab trainees and uh yeah thank you also for all of the work that you're doing in this moment we appreciate you thank you for making this series and for uh having me here and i'm very excited to see what comes from [5501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWfwZvfaoYA&t=5501.84s)

the people going through all of these and how their [[sensemaking]] and solution capacities increase and what they can do with that thank you
