welcome to episode number 46 today on the show we have daniel 'shmock dan burger again this time he's talking about [[existential risk|existential risks]] and how to avoid them we've already done several other episodes with daniel before and they were always some of our favorites a very mind-expanding and inspirational but i think this one is particularly important because he talks about some of the most pressing issues that we face on our [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=20.55s)

planet today and proposes some ways that we can solve them if you want to check out the previous episodes that we've done with daniel go to future thinkers data work / daniel to get all the books resources and the other things that we mentioned in this episode go to future thinkers at work slash 46 this episode is brought to you by bcd see they're working on several [[blockchain]] based apps to help save the environment one of them is called eco chain and it's a crowdfunding and investment platform for renewable energy projects where people can invest in new clean energy installations and get an roi so bcdc is doing a token sale which is now happening in november 2017 but the presale is already happening now you can see our report and listen to the [61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=61.739s)

[[existential risk]] means some risks that could stop us from existing so a species threatening event there's also plenty of [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] that would just really suck even though we wouldn't be completely wiped out as a species so there are versions of world war three that are existential kinds of nuclear holocaust that nobody makes it through there are kinds of world war three that [170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=170.859s)

are catastrophic meaning some group of people in remote areas make it through but the atmosphere holds you rhenium and you know most of the people did very poorly so we're kind of interested in preventing all of those things right so what are the categories first there's different ways of kind of chunking and different ways of doing taxonomy one thing we can look at is start by saying [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=193.09s)

there are kind of human-induced things and then there's kind of natural phenomena the natural phenomena are things that either arise from within our earth and biosphere or outside of it so outside of it is things like solar flares and carrington events asteroids that can be catastrophic or existential and obviously you know within our atmosphere most of [214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=214.36s)

the natural phenomena that would occur would not be existential but there are some super caldera kinds of scenarios that would be we're obviously interested in any of them because you know if if there was an event that we just couldn't avoid here then mars colony moves up on the priority list right mm-hmm but surprisingly most of these things if we have more intel about them many of [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=236.53s)

them can be avoided or at least mitigated against so for instance if we look at something like a carrington event or we're looking at solar flares or coronal mass ejections that besides the just effect that they would have on biology directly would also have effects on electrical circuitry as far as biology goes there might be a impact on one part of the planet people can go [262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=262.54s)

underground it's not that big a deal but as far as frying the circuitry goes if we're talking about frying the circuitry of nuclear cooling stations on the power plant so then they turn into nuclear volcanoes that's a pretty big deal now we could of course do things to mitigate against the sensitivity there like hardening the nuclear cooling stations and you know other forms of key [282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=282.31s)

infrastructure so even with regard to things that we can call natural phenomena obviously you know there are projects that are looking at asteroids and other near-earth objects because depending upon what we see they might actually be movable and there are a number of projects focused on that then we move our attention to you know human induced things and we can look at the [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=302.05s)

ones that go through environmental pathways basically we either through [[biodiversity loss]] or [[climate change]] ocean acidification or other kinds of effects on our biosphere we create a biosphere that is uninhabitable to humans but we don't even have to get to full uninhabitable 'ti for partial uninhabitable 'ti to lead to the beginning of cascade effects you know [325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=325.24s)

when we look at what happened in syria we see that a major part of what happened in factoring there were many many factors simultaneously but one part of it was drought in an area that had not had droughts led to subsistence farmers moving into the cities the tax to the resource capacity of those cities beyond their limits led to resource wars that led to [346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=346.4s)

factions and that whole kind of thing so when we start looking at [[climate change]] creating massive numbers of refugees and the refugee dynamics leading to war dynamics and resource footage wars economic collapse and then you know cascading wars you can have scenarios where environmental phenomena are the first step in a series of cascades that can occur so you've got all of the [370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=370.88s)

environmental phenomenon the effects of on coral of ocean temperature ocean acidification the loss of big fish in the trophic cascades key species collapse throughout many different dynamics pollinators like there's a lot there's a lot of things in there then we can look at other reasons for just human induced violence towards each other so all of the reasons that something like a [392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=392.03s)

world war three and we see right now the united states leaving its position of clear supremacy as a superpower we see china moving up into that position we have rarely seen transitions of power go smoothly in the history of civilization and we've never had transitions of power be at this kind of global level and with existential level technologies and with over seven billion [416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=416.18s)

people and with a biosphere near collapse and near fragility points like we're in a very different place but even when just there was a local hegemony where the power was moving from one kind of local power to another those were usually not easy transition so lots of different scenarios and then there are the [[exponential tech]] scenarios where different kinds of [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] means exponentially increased power to affect stuff and whether we're talking about through ai or through crispr and biotech or through nanotech you know or through robotics if we have exponentially increasing ability to affect stuff without exponentially increasing good choice making that is just [[self-terminating]] no matter what and that is the scenario we have right now so [[exponential tech]] can lead to existential scenarios on purpose or on accident right you can have just much more powerful kind of capacities military capacities and much more powerful capacity that even smaller actors are able to get nuclear bomb started off as such a difficult thing that only huge date [484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=484.819s)

actors could have it those state actors could watch each other you could have a [[mutually assured destruction]] system so nobody can use it but as you start to have [[exponential tech]] that becomes distributed where smaller and smaller actors have access to larger and larger potential to affect things the ability to avoid that happening gets harder and harder and then you also have [504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=504.05s)

[[exponential tech]] that leads to existential scenarios accidentally so most of the ai risks that boström lays out in super intelligence the gray goo risks that drexler lays out you know these are mostly where we create in autopoietic system we create a self fueling system that has a faster feedback loop is more adaptive than biology and not commensurate with [527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=527.66s)

biology and so we have to avoid accidental extinction as well as on purpose extinction you know that's kind of a rough lay of the land of the categories of [[existential risk]] now if we take a step back from it we can say all of these categories have some things in common some deeper underlying drivers that are actually the real existential concerns because if at this level the [550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=550.22s)

scenarios are basically countless but if we go deeper one way of saying it is that the real [[existential risk]] is a loss of [[sensemaking]] loss of the ability to actually make sense of the world around us and what is worth doing what the likely effects of things will be what the effects of our actions are now and so let me think about it how long do we have with ocean [574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=574.79s)

acidification before the coral die right now the thoughts on that vary so widely that it's either the most important issue or we have quite a bit of time and is fukushima really close to releasing a lot of radiation or not and can north korea's nuclear each certain places or not and what are the real risks with agi parasitic ai etcetera like if we don't have better ability to make sense of [599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=599.66s)

these things then they just all fail scenarios right because we don't know how to prioritize what should actually get attention paid to it and what could be successful and what's not likely to be successful so we can say that a lack of information coherence is one of the things that is at the heart of driving them and now to take us deeper step we say well within [620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=620.84s)

capitalism and we can set even further back in a moment but let's take that step within capitalism where we're playing a competitive game we're playing a win-lose game usually zero-sum sometimes small positive some but still fundamentally win lose information is a source of competitive advantage so we are incented to both hoard information and to create disinformation we actually [643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=643.76s)

like if we succeed at that we will actually do better within the system so as you have [[exponential tech|exponential technologies]] the ability to do more media spread more different info through more channels etc how do we have exponential information tech with the incentive to disinformation and actually be able to have enough coherent information to have any idea what the is going on well [668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=668.03s)

basically we don't you know when you think about like getting towards the tipping point of [[climate change]] where if we you know we get to a positive feedback loop with warming or something and if we don't stop a dynamic before a certain point we won't be able to afterwards we're actually pretty close to the point of peak disk coherence where if we get to that place we might [687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=687.35s)

not actually be able to recover coherence and so i would say that's one way of thinking about what is actually essential another way of theme about what's essential is like we said [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] it's very hard for people's intuition to grasp what an [[exponential curve]] is because most of the things we experience don't feel like exponential things but most of [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=709.52s)

technology that is exponential is increasing our ability to affect something with our choice but it's not increasing the quality of our choice now when you multiply these together actually decreased information coherency with increased impact that is a [[self-terminating]] scenario right so what are some of the ways of avoiding that especially i liked what you said about [733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=733.46s)

our loss of [[sensemaking]] in the [[exponential curve]] of that also that's a really interesting factor that i think a lot of people aren't talking about it relates to one of the questions i was going to ask what do we do about the sort of institutionalized ignorant of people - what is actually going on and there's you mentioned the corporate interests and producing [756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=756.2s)

disinformation but there's also you know bad educational systems that are outdated or motivated by different factors that have nothing to do with actually giving people good information and then there's research that serves corporate needs and then there's media propaganda and politics and all the stuff so what kind of tools do we actually have to change these systems in [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=778.52s)

a way that they serve the planet rather than serving these individual interests we could say well when you talk about sense-making shouldn't that be science shouldn't science be sense-making in the same way that we shouldn't journalism be sense-making ray aren't these shouldn't the intelligence agencies of the world be sense-making you know we've seen scenarios where a scientist publishes a [800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=800.2s)

scientific paper in a prestigious scientific journal where the paper that they wrote is complete gibberish they made it up with technical sounding words but it's actually gibberish and it goes through the publication process because they came from the right university or whatever and they were doing that just to show that the peer-review process is broken we've also seen where you know stats like 50% of the articles posted in places like journal of american medical association five years later the findings are found to have been misinterpreted or wrong or had bad methodology etc 50% wrong means that if i'm reading a cutting-edge medical journal my chances of knowing what's true are 50/50 right it's like pulling [843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=843.86s)

teeth yves would give me as much of a sense of what's true it's unbelievable yeah is a broken [[sensemaking]] system within science if you want to think about what the heart of science is like what the essence of the philosophy of sciences the essence of it is earnest inquiry right like earnest desire to understand the nature of reality and so whatever the speed of sound actually is [866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=866.57s)

i don't care if it is different than i think it is i want to find out there's a certain reverence for reality and respect for the nature of what is beyond my own idea about it or how i can benefit from it that is at the heart of the scientific impulse but the scientists that need paid and the equipment has to come from somewhere and if there are some of the [887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=887.74s)

answers that are more profitable than other answers then it's easier to put money into it because i'll be able to get that money back and if an herb or a plant has some medicinal property but i will never be able to patent it and i won't be able to recoup the money that i get from you know the small margins that i would put into the research how can we afford to pay for it [908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=908.32s)

but we will with say some synthetic thing i can get a patent on and etc right so what actually gets researched within that structure and how it gets researched so you have you have to factor how deep those kind of [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] end up trickling through the whole thing so then you ask a good question which is within a system within a fundamentally win-lose game-theoretic [930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=930.13s)

system how do you prevent these issues and be able to have real coherency when we are incented to withhold information and even you know like you'll you'll see in soccer football whatever someone will fake left to try and get the other person to go left and then they'll actually go right right like that's disinformation intentional disinformation so that you can throw the [951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=951.49s)

opponent off so you can win this is not different in corporations or nations right and intel and counter intel and an intentional disinformation same thing but with global level consequence so here's another good way of thinking about it think about early tribes as competitive teams almost like a sports team where they have to work really well together and be very coherent with each [976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=976.48s)

other to be able to compete with other teams and military conflicts when they occur and compete with the other teams for scarce resources in the shared environment the shared commons say they they weren't military right they're just doing their own thing there's plenty of abundance but then if any of them realize that they can do this military thing go kill another tribe take their [995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=995.74s)

stuff and get the riverfront that they had or get whatever kinds of things they had acquired and developed that actually worked for them work better now everyone else has to build defensive militaries at least otherwise they lose by default and so one of the things get in the history of win-lose [[game theory]] is that one it worked you could actually go kill the other people take [1016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1016.56s)

their stuff and make stuff better for you and you know your people and two if you didn't play win lose [[game theory]] and someone else did you lost by default right which is why most of the more peaceable less militaristic cultures got wiped out so then we say you know one of the tribes is just bigger and stronger than us we're not going to be able to compete with them but if two or three of [1037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1037.77s)

us smaller tribes band together we can but then of course the other side has to compete so they band together and so now we move from tribes to villages right and then we can move up two kingdoms into nation-states into global economic trading bloc's i mean think about those evolutions of what we think of as like civilization structures as evolutions of competitive [1055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1055.56s)

teams within a win-lose [[game theory|game theoretic]] structure that have more and more power to be able to out-compete the other one and that's both have more people that can be coherent with each other against the other one right so then where as a nation where a team competing against the other one we have a shared military-industrial complex paid for by taxes whatever or as a religion or a [1074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1074.91s)

race so we can have some overlapping teams but once you get to the point where all of the teams are stepping up simultaneously that's the kind of evolutionary driver they're stepping up in their power once you get to the point that you have exponential technological power on multiple teams where the amount of power that it would take to actually win would require destroying the playing [1096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1096.45s)

field which becomes inevitable right inevitably power will keep increasing until it's actually bigger than the playing field can tolerate and then winning pretty much means losing because there is nothing left to win right so right now we're at a place where the super powers of the world cannot win a war against each other when you have hundreds of times the nuclear capacity [1116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1116.64s)

necessary to kill all life on earth there is no winnable war but we keep building more military capacity we just spend you know a trillion and a half dollars on the f-35 because we didn't have badass enough jets with the military that already has all the technical capability that it has in the u.s. right and and think about what a trillion and a half dollars resources [1135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1135.63s)

means to other kinds of things and so when you say why did we ever get more than five times as many nukes as we to kill all life on earth like after you've got enough nukes to kill life on earth five or ten times why do you keep building more - well you have hundreds of times was that ever a really just strategically smart idea or was that because we had a for-profit [1155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1155.97s)

military-industrial complex that makes money when that happens where the people who are in positions of decision-making power also happened to be shareholders or have vested interest in those structures and this is not blaming the people involved these are structural right these are structural dynamics and so can you have lasting peace and a for-profit military-industrial complex [1177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1177.239s)

at the same time of course not right like that's supplied in demand 101 that if there is a massive capacity for supply it has to protect the demand and then you think about where those [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] go everywhere right health care where if people weren't sick then the system loses all of its resource and so how could it ever really invest in prevention deeply when its [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1198.419s)

profitability depends upon symptom management if you even cured people quickly that's not profitable but if you manage symptoms ongoingly it's profitable and if the symptom management causes other issues that need more symptom management ie more meds that's just like an upsell or cross-sell maximizing the lifetime revenue of a customer that happens to be a patient so [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1219.57s)

when you think about you know win lose [[game theory]] within that kind of incentive structure where we can't win at the wars anymore and yet we're moving closer to the kinds of tensions where war becomes more and more probable and we also can't win at competing for extracting the scarce resource when we've already extracted so much scarce resource we're almost at the biospheres [1242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1242.94s)

limits right we're almost at the limits of what can be handled in the extraction of oil or fish or grazing land for cattle or so many things and so either we continue with win lose [[game theory]] and it becomes omni lose-lose catastrophic lee or we have to figure out how to have that power not turned against the other power and figure out what does omni win-win mean where no one [1268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1268.049s)

has incentives that are misaligned with the well-being of others in that system that has that much power and that's really the fork in the road we're at as a species for the first time ever now is we either figure out what on nee win-win means economically as a worldview governance wise we either figure out what that means or we continue with win-lose and [1289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1289.259s)

it becomes omni lose-lose which pretty much means we either step up into a radically higher level of quality of life existence for the new kind of [[collective intelligence]] or we have a catastrophic step down existential or near existential but like in the next not very long time that's really the fork in the road and what evidence do you see of us going down one path or the [1312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1312.72s)

other with more preference if we just plot curves it doesn't look good right if we just plot the curves of what has happened so far with regard to how much harm came from new power that we developed and we look at how fast we are developing new power on [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] if we look at the population curves and we look at you know biosphere issues like it it all looks pretty bad [1336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1336.84s)

from that point of view and you can try and take the technology minister out and say but look at the rate at which we are developing solutions but here's the problem with that here's another way of thinking about what the driver of the [[existential risk]] and all the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are so one way is of thinking about it is that when lose [[game theory]] is driving the whole thing right when lose structures are driving the whole thing with win lose [[game theory]] multiplied by exponential power and exponential populations another way of looking at it is a lack of information coherence i mean there's information coherence and coherence as beings and agents with each other another way of thinking about it is a lack of coherence around value measures and this is [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1377.46s)

actually a very deep and essential way of thinking about it think about a tree in an ecosystem and we say well what is the value of that tree well it's providing a home for a bunch of pollinators and birds it's providing food for them with flowers it's stabilizing topsoil it's symbiotic with the micro rui-zhi and the fungus and bacteria in the soil it's providing [1399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1399.389s)

shade for all of these things it's you know pulling out co2 and producing oxygen and providing food for animals and you know it might have millions of value metrics as part of this kind of complex ecosystem but then we cut it down to make it ten thousand dollars with the two-by-fours and its value is ten thousand dollars and the two by fours right like they're not [1422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1422.309s)

sequestering co2 and stabilizing top soil they are serving as a structural strut is this one really simple thing right structural stress so we took this very complex thing and we reduced the complexity of it radically we made it a very simple thing so we down cycled the  out of it because what the metric we were seeking to optimize was dollars in my account and so like a dollar is a [1445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1445.889s)

value metric but i get the $10,000 from that tree or i get $10,000 from the elephant tusks right or i get 10,000 from this servicer well as i count how do i relate the value of an elephant tusks or a person's art or a tree like these should not be fungible they should not be inter exchangeable these are fundamentally different things but because i remove all of the information [1470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1470.7s)

from them and all of the contexts i want them to be simply exchangeable in terms of capital so i can maximize the ease of transaction to grow pools of capital that is an extinction area dynamic is that we're taking complex value and turning it into simple value that almost sounds like a gray goo scenario of itself it is we're taking all of these super complex things and reducing them [1493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1493.98s)

to this homogenous goo that is monetary value i actually just saw a really good article that was called capitalism as a paper clip maximizer and it's actually a really fun [[thought experiment]] paper clip maximizer if the people aren't familiar was i don't remember who came up with it first but it was in nick bostrom's book on ai issues and just said you know we could have an ai whose job was you know [1518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1518.789s)

working at a paperclip company to maximize paperclip production and it also had the capacity to upgrade its own capacity and it ends up getting into a place where it makes all these paper clips and upgrades its own ability to make more paper clips and then it starts competing you know taking all of the resource that humans needed to make paper clips because that's its algorithm [1538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1538.71s)

and as its increasing its own capacity it's being able to out-compete us and then realizes that we are made of atoms that it can make paperclips out of it you know that it's this kind of continuously growing right this autopoietic capacity that's just turning everything into paperclips and so who they were saying you know this paper capitalism is a [1556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1556.63s)

[[paperclip maximizer]] because capital is making more capital that's kind of the gist of this distributed system rather than as a central ai it's this distributed kind of [[collective intelligence]] system they uses these distributed human bio processors within it but because we've reduced the value to capital and having more capital makes it easier to get more capital the [1577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1577.24s)

capital gains interest faster than the overall economy grows gives you access to more financial services etc then you know that's the goal so to say capitalism as a paper clip maximizer is a reasonable thing and drexler's model of grey goo was based on another [[exponential tech]] which was nanotech the ability to rearrange things at a molecular or atomic level if we do that [1597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1597.34s)

right it's pretty awesome right if we do it right it's like the replicator from star trek we can take trash and turn it back into rad stuff at the level of just atoms and that actually might be the future of the [[materials economy]] is that we have quantum computing that has enough sophistication you know give or take a million qubits to be able to properly direct nano tronics to take old [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1618.4s)

stuff and turn it back into new stuff at an atomic level creating a closed-loop [[materials economy]] that can upcycle indefinitely but if we get it wrong then you can have you know these machines that are just turning everything into gooks webex ler had this you know model it's called grey goo and in a way uv you're right capitalism as grey goo is you know we take this tree with this [1639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1639.49s)

radical contextualized complex value and take it out of its context and give it this reduced abstracted simplified value metric and we've done that to 80% of the old-growth forests that the earth spent billions of years developing you know and 90% of the large fish species in the ocean and then what is that capital really do other than continue to do that autopoietic thing and so when people [1666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1666.64s)

think about like what is capitalism and honestly like we can say communism and socialism were really actually subsets of this kind of resource concentration system it's a process of abstracting value so we go from complex value to abstracted value and then extracting it and accumulating it that particular model came from colleague forrest landry and [1687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1687.88s)

you know capitalism does that but socialism communism have other versions of doing that but that's the core thing that's the ring of power that has to be broken is abstraction of value and specifically a reductive abstraction extraction so you remove the content from its context and accumulation and that's how you take a [[complex system]] that is resilient and turn it into a [1710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1710.71s)

complicated system that's not resilient that becoming progressively simpler in kill it this brings up something i find to be fascinating which is the use of [[blockchain]] to tokenize abstract value do you have thoughts about this and whether it's actually possible to do this i can get more specific if you need yeah please do so we had an interview last year with vince means and he talked [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1733.12s)

about tokenizing these abstract values actually he used the tree example so what if you can tokenize all the the extra abstract value that a tree provides you know have a token for oxygen converted that sort of thing and what if you can optimize those different tokens in the same way that capitalism optimizes capital can we use these other systems of value and use them as [1756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1756.4s)

currency as well i say that loosely and optimize that using the existing capitalist system i don't think so lazy faire capitalism always kind of goes there it says the tragedy of the commons is because if nobody owns it then they'll it up but if someone owned it they take responsibility for it so really the answer is to have everyone own everything every coral reef every [1777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1777.07s)

everything is owned and we have some way of creating capitalists value in the process of owning it this breaks down for a number of reasons so why is a are not worth anything in gold is worth so much because in a win-lose game model something that everyone has access to and can't not have access to and i can't get any more of doesn't give me competitive advantage so everyone has [1800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1800.08s)

access to air so i don't need to value it i don't need to pay attention to it and now if i cut down this tree course i'm cutting down something that produces oxygen and sequester co2 but i'm not cutting down enough to up everything i'm not cutting down enough to really affect my experience at all now of course as you get seven billion people with that mindset it becomes a [1821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1821.61s)

different story but distributed lis they're all thinking about their own action and that if if i cut this tree down i have $10,000 worth of 2x4 s in my pocket and i need to feed my family and i don't have any measurably less oxygen but multiply that by seven billion and we all die right but if i don't cut this tree down that tree in the commons is worth nothing to me in terms of [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1843.9s)

differential or competitive advantage and i have a system where pre something like basic income even before competitive image i just need to live right so if i can take something out of the commons to live like i'm gonna do that so gold or diamonds or whatever are worth a lot because they were perceived as scarce when we started the valuation [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1864.21s)

schema and if there wasn't enough for everyone to have lots of it then some people could have it and others wouldn't and those who had it had something that was unique where they had some differential advantage but it's still fiat right like whether it's just printed dollars or gold that we ascribe that value to that is not based on that the actual material value of the gold [1884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1884.73s)

and we said it in bats it's still like it's a value metric that we made up and so we'll have gold worth you know however much per ounce and because of that if there's gold under some trees we'll cut down a lot of trees to get the gold out and burn up the oxygen or damage it in the process because we have a system that is valuing differential value not systemic value that's if you [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1903.87s)

start saying well how do we actually advance systemic value and you can't really tokenize that because as long as there are separate balance sheets and i have some number of tokens and i'm trying to advance the number of tokens that i have in competition with other members we're gonna keep getting all these win-lose dynamics right so the post-capitalist move is a deeper move in [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1926.49s)

that now does that mean that tokens and [[blockchain]] can't serve a transitionary role no of course they can right now we make up the currency units you know through a central bank well you can have another group make up a different kind of unit and you can build some better structures into that unit and that can be valuable totally but as long as we still have [1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1948.899s)

private ownership of those units that if i have more of the units to begin with it's easier to get more of them if i have less to begin with it's harder to get more of them so i have widening wealth caps built in all of the other shitty aspects of capitalism all of the derivatives and complex financial instruments and up markets will end up arising from those competitive [1972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1972.059s)

structures those are just basically inexorable ways to game the game so then our so what do we do we do need a completely new economics we do need a completely new system of sense-making we do need a completely new system of choice making right governance add an axiomatically redesigned level and you know when most people when you ask them what is economics they think well it's a [1998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=1998.64s)

system of trade system of barter right they're already assuming private ownership and trade and barter that is then mediated by some kind of currency but you have systems that don't have private ownership that don't have trade right because i don't own to trade to you we have some kind of systemic value we just didn't like those ones because for the most part we thought of [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2017.63s)

those as communist socialist systems where if i didn't privately own stuff then the state was giving me what i needed but then the state was also forcing me to do because as long as there are shitty jobs that nobody wants to do that we don't have intrinsic motive to do but the society needs done how do you get the people to do the shitty jobs well if we kind of meet [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2039.649s)

everyone's needs throughout this thing called like a state then the state has to force some people to do the shitty jobs so we call that imperialism and we don't like communism because it's imperialists so we say well let's let the free market force them which is if they can't be smarter and educate themselves better to do a better job and they get the shitty jobs and if they [2058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2058.22s)

don't the state isn't forcing them but they will still be homeless and starve it's just where do we where do we switch the imperialism right we switch it from the state to the to the market but where basically we still have to have a system of extrinsic incentive to control people to do that they're not intrinsically oriented to do well okay so that's been part of [2076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2076.159s)

we've had to work with and marx had talks on it and smith had its thoughts on it but technological unemployment is changing that whole story where you can start to automate the shittiest jobs so you can have a system where the things that people actually could have intrinsic incentive to do or what are there for humans to do the things that you had to extrinsically and [2093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2093.409s)

sent them for you don't have to like that's a new thing that means an axiom which is how do we deal with the labor force an axiom is changing and so we have to go back and rethink all of our economic ideas and with regard to [[sensemaking]] there's a lot of core things that are changing in terms of our capacity for [[sensemaking]] you know we have the ability to have iot sensors right [2115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2115.04s)

internet of things sensors that are giving us real-time data about air chemistry and water chemistry and soil chemistry and fisheries in the commons and etc and we have deep learning systems it can be synthesizing that information we like we never had [[sensemaking]] systems like that like we didn't even have the technological capacity for things like that and choice making [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2135.71s)

systems so basically we are at the face of deeper issues and we've ever been at the face of before but also with deeper capacities so the same increased technological capacity that if we keep using it to take complex things and make them simple simple or complicated instead of complex and we keep using it to fight against each other and win in competitive win-lose games if we keep [2158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2158.87s)

doing that with these increased technologies that's existential but if we use those technologies to actually obsolete those core [[social structure|social structures]] and create coherency based [[social structure|social structures]] where that technology can be used for not against then i mean we really do have a fork between radically better than anything we've ever experienced or catastrophic well so now [2181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2181.88s)

my question is we talk about all these different structures that we can create for humanity to exist within but there's also [[human nature]] and not just [[human nature]] but the nature of something being alive as essentially being a replicator machine so we have some sort of intrinsic tendencies that may be very difficult to hack and no matter how you structure the system we're going to [2211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2211.579s)

default to those tendencies for example you know that's probably one of the reasons why communism didn't work it just in some ways it probably went against [[human nature]] or the nature of just a lot of things that are alive so how do we deal with that in your opinion that's not why communism didn't work though yes there were things about the way it was structured that did not [2236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2236.359s)

structure themselves well with humans but it's important to get that it wasn't like it wasn't a good structure and  up [[human nature]] was the problem if that it actually wasn't a good structure there were good parts of it but in trying to keep us from having economic inequality because economic inequality would continue to inexorably widen it became a [2255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2255.469s)

lowest-common-denominator system and it became a system of lack of freedom and some really key ways so yes it was against our nature but is actually against good parts of our nature so then the question is are there shitty parts of our nature or inexorably problematic parts of our nature this will be the hardest part of the conversation so far because i'm going to say that what we [2274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2274.519s)

call [[human nature]] is mostly human conditioning that is actually quite changeable and i don't even mean genetic engineering or brain computer interface are necessary let's unpack this the question you asked is an essential question when we look at japan or denmark or i think there's a few nordic countries that have had decreasing populations after they reach a certain [2300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2300.349s)

level of economics and education it is not that the nature is to do exponential population curves forever it that is the nature within a certain set of conditions when the conditions change many of the deepest like even procreation behavioral dynamics and drives start to shift without externally imposed things like birth caps at china had it's really important to see that [2320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2320.479s)

when you look at some of the indigenous cultures pre capitalism that didn't have private ownership they had shared structures and they had languages that express that concept of sharing they had radically de-emphasized words like mine and radically increased words like ours in any of those cultures we can see some of that in some of the fijian polynesian cultures the mas wah you know [2343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2343.729s)

wherever the mine language was less emphasizing the nature of the language also words like selfish and greedy and jealous were less emphasized because those are the results of memetic structures of scarcity based value in a competitive framework structures so when we say what is [[human nature]] it does a little bit that's definitely [[human nature]] like an impulse to write oneself when they start falling or to pull away from heart right like of these autonomic functions those are nature but so like when you say we get what is essentially [[human nature]] what was uniquely adaptive about us is that our genetic selected for memetics right our genetic selected for a creature that could continue evolving itself developing itself within the course of its life pretty radically [2391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2391.03s)

which is why a baby horse can be up and walking in minutes and it takes us a year think about how many multiples of the twenty minutes it takes a horse to get up go into a year for a human how useless we are for so long even a baby gorilla can hold on to its mom's first you moves around to the trees in the first day we can't even move our head for three months right and that's [2413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2413.35s)

because we're born jnanis were born basically still embryos we're we're imprinting the world were born into because as complex tool makers and tool evolvers with our capacity for abstraction we evolved the environment around us radically and so creatures they evolved genetically to their environmental niche but we're changing our own environment so we have to be [2436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2436.36s)

able to adapt to new environments that we create so we have to come in not hardwired because it was super adaptive to be able to throw a spear at one point but today like you and me don't throw spears that much we text and we do other  so we need to not just have really good genetic orientation for spear throw and we need to have the capacity to come here with almost nothing not even move [2455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2455.65s)

our head and imprint the world that we're in and so that memetics is mediated largely through neuroplasticity and the ability to have a lot of our behavior not just bottom-up genetically controlled but talk-down regulated and the top-down systems are highly influenceable and so we can say humans genetic selected for plasticity and plasticity has a pretty shoe [2476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2476.8s)

amount of variants and its capability and so you know we can create environments like in you know look at the child shoulder situations in sudan or places like that where we can take almost everyone through a process that makes various degrees of psychopathy we can also you know like look at buddhist culture where you had millions of people all care about insects enough to not [2498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2498.82s)

harm them right beyond the [[dunbar number]] they had a something that developed abstract empathy across the population and so that doesn't mean humans are naturally psychopaths or naturally highly empathetic it means we are naturally capable of being conditioned in either of those ways or any of many different ways we do have an innate impulse towards agency towards [2521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2521.2s)

self-actualization within a win-lose game structure that will look like a competitive impulse but within other structures and win-win structures that will look like the desire to go beyond my own previous capacity but not to necessarily be better than or you know consume somebody or something else and so that's where there is an innate impulse but it expresses itself through [2544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2544.09s)

context no let's take the next step there's another really key step here until very recently humans didn't have any concept of what evolution was and we only recently did and we're only right now beginning to have a deep sense of what it actually is not just biologic natural selection but the process by which subatomic particles come into atoms come into molecules come into more [2566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2566.59s)

complex organic structures the dust clouds turn into stars and spiral galaxies that there is that evolution is this process of increasing orderly complexity in a way that has more and more synergy so more and more [[emergent property]] and the [[emergent property|emergent properties]] define the arrow of evolution and as we're starting to understand this you know like very few people but the [2588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2588.88s)

beginning of us starting to understand this we can actually become conscious agents of evolution we can like god say holy universe is actually doing something it's actually moving in this direction of increasing orderly complexity we can consciously participate with that and we move from just being a part of the whole where evolution is just kind of this [2607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2607.93s)

unconscious algorithmic process so thinking about feeling identifying with and being an agent for the whole and so then evolution itself becomes an identically mediated process that we actually say the whole [[evolutionary process]] resulted in me i am the result of this whole [[evolutionary process]] - in a way the [[evolutionary process]] is kind of awoke to itself in me as i'm contemplating it and so then we stopped needing pushed by evolutionary pressure and pain to evolve and we start being able to evolve consciously by what tear de chardin called the lure of becoming because we actually identify as evolutionary's right as as part of the evolutionary impulse and in doing so really obsolete the need for pain as an evolutionary driver so i know i said a [2653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2653.529s)

number of things in there but [[human nature]] has the capacity to transcend much of what human behavior has been so far so well said it's like we're the tentacles of the universe or something yeah sensors and the actuators right yeah it's a quite a spiritual proposition to that we are becoming conscious of what we are and acting based on that realization yeah and i [2685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2685.059s)

actually don't think anything less than that is adequate for preventing [[existential risk]] and that's a big deal that really frames up what we're here to talk about which is as we have increasingly distributed exponential ability for impact we really have to have exponentially increasing good choice making omni considerate choice making everywhere so as long as i when [2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2710.17s)

we talk about win lose [[game theory]] at the deepest level it starts with me having a sense of self that's separate from everything else even all the way down to the semiotic stew the language right i was told when i was a little kid i mean daniel and your mic and your uv and that's a chair and that's a house and that's a crow and but it's all this just separate stuff in universe and i [2731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2731.499s)

can be a good boy or a bad boy independent of what's happening for anybody or anything else i can actually win at the expense of someone else losing and a baseball game whatever and get a whole lot of praise and someone else winning tonight right like i i am not only a separate self but i am also a separate self in competition for the scarce things including scarce love [2753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2753.819s)

right and scarce attention so that's imprinted that's the basis of the win-lose structures at the level of individual separate self-identity when the reality is we go a little bit deeper if we weren't playing silly games right what the am i without all the plants that make all the oxygen i don't exist i can't breathe my mother wouldn't have been able to breathe i wouldn't [2776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2776.14s)

have been born right without plants i am not even a concept so how am i a separate self if i am required the plants but the plants required the pollinators and the micro rui-zhi and the soil and on and on and what would i be without gravity i'm not anything without gravity or without electromagnetism what would i be without the people that came before [2797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2797.589s)

me that made the language within which i think all of my thoughts that has actually patterned the way in which i think and feel and structure the world right and i started to say well i'm actually i wouldn't exist without all of it so that south african sang on ubuntu i am because we are is actually profound meaning me as a separate self right okay so take gravity away take [2819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2819.219s)

electromagnetism away take the plants away i'm floating in the middle of a universe with no i'm not even floating there's nothing holding me together right like the concept of me as a separate self is nonsense it's a misnomer really it's just like when you take the tree out of the rain forest and turn it into wood it's worth a whole lot less the context had it was its value [2840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2840.279s)

right its value was the content within the context which co-evolved i am within a context and without that context i don't even exist and so when i get that i am a misnomer as a separate thing that really i am an [[emergent property]] of the whole i'm an [[emergent property]] of the biosphere but not just a biosphere because without the sun i wouldn't be very interesting [2864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2864.039s)

either and without the laws of universe i wouldn't i'm an [[emergent property]] of universe and so are you and we're interconnected in this and that's waking up at a cognitive level at a existential at a spiritual level and really we need new macroeconomics economics is basically what do we value don't value oxygen because we can't get any competitive advantage off it even [2886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2886.05s)

though we'd all die without it but value the gold because i'll get some competitive advantage even though i'm just gonna stick it in a safe not do anything with it value the whale dead because i can do stuff with it i don't value it live right like what do we value our [[value system]] is codified in a value equation that then determines what we confer power to that's economics [2902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2902.339s)

totally spiritual thing so we need new macroeconomics that aligns the incentive of every agent with the well-being of every other agent and of the commons because any gap between your incentive and my well-being or your incentive and the well-being of the commons then you will do what you're intended to do and you will externalize harm directly or indirectly right and with exponential [2925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2925.95s)

increasing technology that harm will always become catastrophic eventually so we need new macroeconomics that fundamentally align our well-beings with each other and in doing so we have no incentive for disinformation we only have incentive for information so now science become science actually right in journalism actually come to journalism we actually make sense of stuff [2947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2947.369s)

because i'm not trying to hide information from you or lead you down the wrong track so i get there first and we need you know so like new macroeconomics new sense make new systems of choice making all the way down to a new worldview where we actually identify with the evolutionary impulse so we don't need pain to push us we are evolving right we're being and [2966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2966.15s)

becoming and doing at the same time for ourselves and the whole at the same time and all the way down to our personal identity shifting from being a separate self which is just nonsense to being a unique [[emergent property]] of reality and when i get that you are a unique [[emergent property]] of reality and you have had life experiences you've sensed stuff that i haven't you have a [2991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=2991.5s)

perspective on everything that i couldn't possibly have you have the ability to do stuff that i can't do if you self actualize fully you will create beauty in the world that i couldn't write like no amount of michelangelo's self-actualization would have done mc escher or salvador dali like their own kinds of unique creation capacity and so i can only compete with you when we [3014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3014.739s)

reduce you and me to very simple metrics right how much money do we have or how fast can you run or whatever right but when we go back to the full metrics and it's basically an indefinite number of metrics and the synergistic combinatoric of those they're incomparable so now the competition thing is gone because i'm i'm identified with this whole complex thing not this little narrow thing that [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3039.46s)

in that narrow thing we can compete with each other right when that's gone then you self actualizing not only doesn't take away from me you self actualizing makes a more beautiful universe in a way that i can't but i want to live in that more beautiful universe so i'm incentive to help you self actualize the gist of the story as i see it is that we awaken to that to everyone as a unique [[emergent property]] of an interconnected whole who needs to simultaneously self actualize help everyone else self actualize with the attendant [[economic system|economic systems]] governance systems etc we're all individual agentic activity is good for the individual and the whole simultaneously just like cells in your body they're not competing against each other for scarce resource even though [3087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3087.729s)

we've tried to retrofit that shitty capitalist idea on biology as a weird kind of [[confirmation bias]] they like when you think of it in almost mythic terms you have to think of it mythic terms [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] is you know where does an exponent scale to as we're moving towards having the power of gods like barbara marx hubbard said this win you know she watched the bomb be dropped [3106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3106.329s)

by her godfather's who were you know the generals that that were directing world war two and she saw that mushroom cloud from her oshima and she's like none of the depictions i ever heard of of zeus's lightning bolt were as big as that and so she went asked and she asked eisenhower and you know the other generals i think macarthur and she said i see this new power that we have and i [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3128.619s)

see the power of it that's bad what is the power of it that's good and they had no answer and so she set out on that life quest to answer that question you know but but this other part of it we can ask is if we're scaling towards the power of gods you have to have the wisdom and the love of gods were you self-destruct and so you know when you do you think of it in [3149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3149.24s)

those mythic terms it's like that's really that's really the story right now and so the other part of that mythic term is you know the coming of a different age and an age that is not categorized or characterized by like fundamentally separate interest and competition for scarce resources with separate interests power over dynamics but is characterized by this will sound [3172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3172.07s)

corny but characterized fundamentally by the metric we are optimizing is love which requires all the complex metrics of everything the tree is it requires recontextualizing things and unobstructed them into their instantiation rather and why i say love is what brings the atoms together into molecules is these attractive forces right what brings the molecules gether [3196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3196.73s)

what probably two of you together to make this thing what brought us together there's these attractive forces that bring anything together it leads to synergy that leads to the [[emergent property|emergent properties]] that leads to evolution and ultimately we become stewards of that bringing reality together into higher and higher order synergies it's funny how this is such a repeated lesson to go [3215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3215.39s)

towards what attracts you instead of avoiding what repels you like love is something i've never cared to define as well as you've defined i'm curious how you've actually arrived at that being dimetric like maybe can you unpack that a little more it's not a metric because you can't put a number on it so that was kind of euphemistic language but it is love is a very besides damaged word [3237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3237.31s)

unwell to find word in english but if we if we want to borrow from another language and take the eros an agape model i think it's useful so the eros model of love erotic love doesn't just mean sex sex is one place that it expresses itself but it is a passionate desire yes you know energy it's an attraction so we can think of things being attracted together right people [3263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3263.27s)

being attracted together to procreate to make new life as a special case example of people being attracted together to create anything or anything being attracted together to create anything right subatomic particles being attracted together to have this relationship that is atoms and so we can think of the evolutionary impulse right as kind of in [3284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3284.559s)

eros energy and the agape energy that's a kind of love and so when we think about participating with the evolutionary impulse of universe consciously participating with it then we think about supporting things coming together in right relationships that are synergistic right that's what's a mning at the you know there is no destination it's an eternal process of becoming and [3309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3309.849s)

blossoming the agape love is actually worth mentioning here it is often thought of as an unconditional caring for i think a decent way of thinking about is you can't love something or someone meaningfully if you don't actually see them understand them right otherwise it's just an abstract kind of concept but for me to really love you i've got to understand you i've got to [3333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3333.249s)

know you which means for me to really love you have to seek to understand you and know you and then as i understand you and know you more unable to love the unique being that you actually are and in seeing your uniqueness and you're irreplaceable 'ti in universe i want for you everything that could help you enjoy life self actualize contribute fully and so the process of seeking to see and [3352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3352.63s)

know reality and wanting for it and wanting to add to it is that impulsive love and i think it's those two impulses the becoming impulse in the being impulse the evolving and the nourishing impulses that become the deepest kind of drivers of the both interstates and the macro systems in the future so here's a difficult question the people who are creating the [[economic system|economic systems]] are not very enlightened at the moment so how can we and can we help people awaken to this understanding so that we can create the kinds of systems that will support our evolution because we're kind of running out of time well if you think about you know within a current [[economic system]] moving up in the ladder of success in the [[economic system]] requires things like justifying [3409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3409.599s)

externality the thing we're doing is really good so it's worth all of that mining damage or all of that waste damage or the the you know poor condition or workers are in or whatever so someone whose empathy is really intact can't do that and so if you don't have the ability to shut your empathy off which is kind of low-grade psychopathy you're just not going to be [3429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3429.49s)

able to succeed and as you start to succeed and get rewarded it's actually a system that is not just attracting but incenting and conditioning a kind of abstract psychopathy and as you get into financial services even more so because you are not providing real goods or services you're basically gain the more you can game the system the better you can do in that dynamic so when you have [3452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3452.74s)

a system that attracts in cents and rewards pathological behavior so it's important to understand that success in the current system has required being at minimum complicit with the the capacity to and willingness to be complicit with that system what we think of as power even which is a power within a win-lose structure power over is psychopath logic right and so we're not creating new [3480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3480.16s)

power structures we're creating new structures for shared activity but they won't be power in the same sense of what we have thought of as power anymore there's a few aspects of how people who are in positions of influence currently can start to to tip one is as they recognize near-term [[existential risk|existential risks]] that are inexorably within the current system which means they will not win [3505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3505.03s)

right their attempt to win where when lose becomes lose-lose because of the power dynamics exceeding the playing fields capacity if they understand that which more and more people in positions of influence are starting to and they realize that they actually need to learn a totally new kind of game and when they realize that the new kind of game that is possible isn't shitty communism it's [3528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3528.55s)

not like a lowest common denominator it's a world where we can create a commonwealth economics that has a higher level of material resource abundance for everyone than any including them currently has because right now we can't make the best phone or the best computer or the best anything because that science knows how to because the ip for how to make the [3552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3552.04s)

best one is held between ten different companies that are competing against each other so we don't get information coherence we don't even research the best things in medicine because some of them aren't profitable so the wealthiest people today don't have access to good healthcare because we're not investing in it the world that they have won in is ending and that is unavoidable that's an [3569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3569.76s)

example so that game is not a game that gets to keep being played in our what the world that we can create is better for even the people who are winning at the current system at the highest level the world that we can create we cantle have a better system of medicine a better system of [[sensemaking]] a you know a healthier environment better technological stuff better [3593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3593.19s)

transportation because of the coherence leading to better resource allocation and development of tech and etc so we can build a world that is better for everyone then building our quality of life today in sustainable harmony with the biosphere for everybody the only thing that they would lose is the differential of how much better it is for them now than it is for everyone [3615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3615.04s)

else but they can't hold on to that anyways i've actually seen many people who you know have been in power positions within the current system who have been coming to these awarenesses naturally so that's an in heartening thing daniel do you have any book recommendations for our listeners if they want to continue learning about these subjects yeah well as we were just [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3634.39s)

talking about a game that's ending in the new game the the book infinite and finite games by james carr says a really great introduction to thinking about what a world beyond [[game theory]] is and it's short and it's actually like it is both an interesting treatise on economics and governance and [[social system|social systems]] and a really profound spiritual book so i recommend that one infinite [3656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3656.619s)

and finite games and you know books like the collapse of complex societies by tainter they go through all of the you know civilizations of the past that collapse and how and why they collapse is a very sobering insight for people to realize that you know [[existential risk]] of the whole species in a whole global level we've never faced before but we have at the level of [3678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3678.73s)

civilizations and we almost always fail and to kind of understand why so that we can make sure you're not repeating that that's actually very valuable very insightful and if people want to read you know about [[existential risk]] itself you know going to the future of life institute or the cambridge center for the study of [[existential risk]] places like that and reading their reports [3700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3700.09s)

those things have a lot of value going even back to like limits of growth and the world 3 model it's surprising how many places the world 3 model was accurate from you know when it was started so there's still value and limits of growth all of those are good ones if i had to pick one for people to start with from here i'd say infinite and finite games it's a good start cool [3720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3720.61s)

thank you i'm gonna pick that up any documentaries or movies or anything multimedia esque that you can recommend you know for people who are not already familiar with jacque fresco's work in the venus project they should get familiar with it because you know there are elements of what's necessary that weren't included he didn't the world he was coming up through he didn't get very [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3740.59s)

exposed to [[complex system|complex systems]] theory so the distinction between needing to build a world that's complex and self-organizing rather than complicated it was not a clear distinction and how since making and how worldview happened he was you know working from a pretty straight kind of tecnico peon point of view and he doesn't speak much to the transition of how we get there but with all those [3758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3758.41s)

critiques in place there's a lot that he spoke to been demonstrated regarding how you could have a system beyond scarcity based capital that worked radically better than this and so i think the documentaries one is called paradise or oblivion one's called the choices ours and also the the second in the zeitgeist addendum the first half is about fractional reserve banking the second [3783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3783.25s)

half is about his work i think for people who haven't got into post capitalism and much depth yet looking at the resource-based economy that the venus project proposed is a really good entry point to some of the thought daniel this has been a fantastic conversation one of my favorites we've ever done so thank you again for coming on and sharing your insights and and [3804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3804.64s)

what you've studied this has just been fantastic for us yeah very inspirational i'm sure listeners will love it these were fun and important topics that we got to cover today this was a blast and you know when you ask how can we help people in positions of influence shift i think what y'all are doing is meaningful towards that so i thank you for that [3824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoPitvLY7c&t=3824.0s)
