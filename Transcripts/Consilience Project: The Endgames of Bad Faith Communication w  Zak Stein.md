music it's gonna be alright music all right everyone welcome to the stoa today's session is called uh the silence project at the star bad faith communication so what is that consilience project for [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=31.599s)

those of you who are discovering this for the first time i'm going to put the blurb in the chat um zach maybe do you want to give a little brief uh overview of the conciliants project instead of me reading the uh the blurb yeah i mean the consilience project is an attempt to convene [52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=52.559s)

a conversation about the most important topics facing civilization and to do that through creating uh insights foundational to social theory uh psychology uh you know [[game theory]] other areas uh that are relevant to you know specifically catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] so we're trying to kind of like begin a very important conversation uh and in fact you know this work on bad faith communication had to be done as a preamble before other conversations could even take place and so we're uh yeah in a sense um trying to publish and provoke conversation [90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=90.72s)

about these topics so along those lines and there's a bunch of articles published and there's a book that's going to be produced and then more articles to come over the next you know three or four years and the article uh we're reading today is the end game of bad faith communication um and uh zach stein who's a member of the consilience team is with us and daniel schmuckenberger uh was going to be joining us today but he broke his foot and he's getting his uh um x-ray as we speak so hopefully he has a speedy recovery and he joins us next time and this is envisioned as a potential series at the stoa perhaps monthly uh so [129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=129.119s)

hopefully have a chance to join us then and i'm going to take in zach in a moment and he's going to summarize the piece and ask him a few questions and then we'll pivot your questions rather quickly so put your question in the chat anytime um and then we'll be heading to breakout rooms for for 30 minutes and maybe rooms of 10. [148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=148.08s)

as well i sent this on email to everyone um if you'd like to put open this google doc up and just put any ideas you have uh regarding uh cultivating a culture of good faith communication um or just general thoughts you'd like to share feel free to do so in this document and that will be shared with [165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=165.12s)

zach and daniel uh probably later this week um so that being said uh i'll take in zach for summarizing article totally yeah i mean i'm gonna summarize the article but i'm also gonna put it in context because it's actually the in a sense the final paper in a series of papers on the nature of contemporary propaganda and kind of large-scale [187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=187.12s)

strategic communication so you know many of the things that i presuppose in this paper about bad faith communication uh were laid out in a series of prior papers you know so it began with the one on [[mutually assured destruction]] in information warfare right it's a mad info war that was actually the first in [209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=209.519s)

a series of papers on propaganda the next one we don't make propaganda they do where we clarify the distinction between education and propaganda and then move through to do very detailed analysis of [[social media]] specifically as a kind of propaganda delivery system that's um very profoundly powerful [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=229.04s)

and so you know the argument uh fundamentally in the bad faith paper is that we've come to be socialized in environments that have been overrun with strategic communication and some of its fourth and fifth generational warfare which is psychological warfare right which is what we talk about in the [250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=250.959s)

information more [[mutually assured destruction]] paper where we say that there's been an [[arms race]] in propaganda and that [[arms race]] has resulted in informational weapons of mass destruction right so we have computational propaganda that's powerful enough to need to be regulated it's being coupled with ai [269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=269.199s)

so that's occurring and then there's also kind of peak advertising and of course advertising is coupled tightly to the history of propaganda you know going back through the major figures in both of those fields and so we're in a situation where the basic informational surround which is the basic kind of ecosystem in which we [290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=290.479s)

socialize is overrun with strategic communication as it's never been before so it's kind of like you know we've dropped the the the equivalent of an atomic bomb in the informational warfare space this happened maybe around 2016. uh and now we're dealing with kind of this background radiation that's seeping into [311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=311.36s)

the life world where bad faith communication is becoming normalized because most of the communication we're interacting with or a lot of it and sometimes the basic frame like on [[social media]] is basically accepting the inevitability of strategic communication as the only [330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=330.24s)

kind of viable form so we fall back habitually into bad faith communication tactics that's going to be overarching kind of context of where this reflection on the nature of bad faith communication stands in a broader research project basically about the state of contemporary propaganda specifically computational propaganda and the power [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=352.88s)

of our phones coupled to [[social media]] and a few other technologies to change the context context of socialization so profoundly that we are yeah again normalizing bad faith communication and so bad faith communication is communication where parties begin to feel that there's really no point in continuing to communicate right there is not an actual interest in reaching mutual understanding uh there's an interest in some other strategic outcome right and so importantly the interest in reaching mutual understanding uh which is key to good faith communication right good faith communication is where both parties are interested in gaining mutual understanding but mutual understanding is not consensus right it's not consensus and in fact the most important thing to know about this uh difference between good and bad faith communication is that it doesn't hinge upon everyone kind of believing the same thing or falling into a lockstep consensus you know and that's what it means to be in good faith is that we can all basically take the same assumptions it's not the case good faith communication is a prerequisite for some kind of learning [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=427.36s)

process where you're committed to mutual understanding even though you may not actually reach it and we'll talk a little bit later in a few minutes about non-naive post-cynical good-faith communication and there's a lot to say about you know in the philosophy of this right uh danielle allen uh who's a philosopher [448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=448.84s)

uh at harvard has this book talking to strangers which is a wonderful book about basically using the history of racial tension in the united states to discuss the need for good faith communication into democracy and she stresses that it's not about consensus uh and that it's actually about learning to navigate uh loss uh and learning to [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=468.319s)

kind of like hold a conversation in the context of disagreement that this is prerequisite for anything like a democracy or an [[open society]] and so so it's clear that there's a difference between good and bad faith communication just as in the prior propaganda papers we wrote about the difference between [489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=489.52s)

education and propaganda and the difference has to do with strategic communication versus communication that's oriented towards reaching some mutual understanding a commitment to stay in conversation where the conversation itself feels like it's worth continuing to have this conversation because both parties are [506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=506.319s)

committed to reaching and understanding even though it's difficult um it's not everyone sits in a circle and holds hands and says the same thing it's that we learn how to kind of basically argue well and keep the conversation productive um uh and so it's worth kind of noting that the uh you know the there's a habermaus jurgen hamer mosque you can't really talk about communication without talking about ross i think uh and his work is foundational here um when you think about the difference between communication that's oriented towards a strategic outcome uh like an advertisement right so an advertisement's a great example of a bad faith communication almost almost 100 percent of the time not always but almost 100 of the time where they're not really getting you to understand the situation the way they understand the situation right they want you to understand the situation a very specific way so that you will buy their product and so it's it's communication and there's an understanding between you in a sense you're getting the meaning of the words right but the goal of the speech act is to manipulate despite mutual understanding whereas as alber moss is saying communicative action which is actually action oriented towards mutual understanding in the interest of collaboration that's based on this presupposition that you know there is something like truth which is to say there is something like an objective state of affairs that [598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=598.16s)

exists that we can both orient to uh and there is something like a better or worse action here like not a specified moral code but a sense that there's it's worth having conversations about what's better or worse and there's a sense of honesty right that you're reaching mutual [614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=614.56s)

understanding you're at least believing that there's a shared interest in reaching your understanding that the conversation's worth having so that's that distinction um but what we've gotten into with advertising and again fourth and fifth generation warfare is actually really powerful forms of [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=634.16s)

bad faith communication these tactics which are outlined in the paper like you know a dozen strategies or whatever it is for carrying out bad faith tactics um these are just like part of our kind of common music sense now [651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=651.92s)

on [[social media]] which is a bizarre thing to say and so that's worth noting that it's um i believe we've reached a point of uh you know media technology innovation i like a la marshall mcluhan where actually we're becoming wedded to these technologies and those technologies functioning in such a way [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=671.68s)

that they are you know basically deeply manipulative and so that is affecting the way that we end up communicating with others because we communicate through these technologies uh and sometimes it even kind of affects the way we communicate with ourselves and this is a harmonizing point that you internalize into your own [690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=690.48s)

self-conversation and you can identify with in your own pathologies like when the identity system is under stress you will lie to yourself about yourself right there will be systematically distorted communication between your own parts right and that's internalizing a communication community outside you [710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=710.72s)

which is also mostly relating strategically rather than mutual understanding and uh yeah so the paper lays out those strategies of bad faith it clarifies that distinction uh and it makes a kind of broader suggestion that it may be that we're so comfortable with bad faith tactics and [730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=730.8s)

actually take a kind of pleasure in the entertainment of watching them unfold uh which is to say it's like a watching a war it's like watching like a shoot em out movie you know that said yeah we have to we actually have to start to reflect on this difference and figure out either [752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=752.88s)

okay if we want to have good faith communication do we actually have to leave [[social media]] is it the case that it's literally designed to create bad faith communication or is there a way to engage in non-naive post-cynical good-faith communication where you can actually turn this [771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=771.519s)

bad faith communication against itself somehow through a higher order use of these new media that's an open question to me because the critique of good faith communication is that you're you become a sucker right these people the system right whoever they are they've been lying to you for years like why should you in any sense [793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=793.279s)

want to cooperate with them right um you're a sucker or you're opening yourself to being manipulated taken in by a you know psychopathic actor or whatever who uses your good faith against you to kind of sucker you into some bad situation so that's naive good faith and naive good faith actually wants everyone to agree [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=812.959s)

on the same thing that's also naive good faith like eventually we'll conversate and you'll basically come to agree with me it's not an interesting mutual understanding but it's it's a kind of naive good faith which is dangerous um and then you get burned and you become cynical and you can only operate in bad faith right so there's a post-cynical non-naive good faith communication which i believe exists and is the kind of ideal we need to hold um and it's unexplored in the paper there's hints right um i think the question of where it can be done is important context is everything [852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=852.8s)

right uh you know for example one of the reasons people believe you should not engage in good faith is because people are bad they're criminals right like they're literally bad guys they're nazis you can't engage in good faith with nazis right but then you have to step back and you think how should a criminal be treated [873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=873.6s)

right should you lie in order to get a criminal prosecuted right should you fabricate evidence to get a criminal prosecuted for example right that's an interesting question because that's a fundamentally bad faith tactic or should you actually try to establish the truth the truth and reach mutual [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=892.399s)

understanding with the criminal but again to do that you have to have a context in which is possible so similarly if you want to engage in good faith conversation it might it may be impossible on [[social media]] hypothesis that's certainly possible in person with the right containers and settings um and uh but this open question which i think is worth exploring is you know what are those forms do we have models have we seen examples of non-naive post-cynical good-faith communication like is that a political strategy and non-naive means it's it has to be post-tragic like it's completely aware of how ridiculous it is to try to engage in good faith with some types of people but you have to do it anyway and this is this insight which is a post-conventional insight into the inevitability of having to live with everybody that there can't be people fundamentally [950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=950.56s)

outside the circle of who we believe it's worth being in mutual understanding doesn't mean we agree with them at all and in fact we could so fundamentally disagree with them that we have to execute legal procedures on them but the legal procedures end up being good faith legal procedures right or else everything's a farce [970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=970.16s)

uh so that's how fundamental the good faith communication is that it's it would have to characterize even the way we treat those people who you know have done the worst so we wanted to stay in communication with them to reach mutual understanding um and so in that sense i think it's uh this open question of under current conditions um you know how do you do it how do you come with good faith communication when the whole ecosystem or at least but you know a lot of your a lot of your experiences with is with strategic communication like advertising [1010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1010.0s)

and the nature of argumentation on on [[social media]] typically being so bombastic and uh full of bad faith tactics that it's akin to watching like a karate fight as opposed to an argument or something so so i'll pause there actually i think and see where the questions land i can elaborate on what i spoke to or [1032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1032.4s)

answer specific questions yeah so uh start putting your questions in the chat um and uh i'll post again the google doc if you'd like to add anything there and i'll warm up back with maybe two questions um yes since uh writing the article or since it got released um any like like technologies or cultural movements uh you found promising uh or inspiring related to cultivating a non-naive uh post cinematical communication style uh i mean there are there are several groups uh usually coming out of the context of [1073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1073.2s)

trying to get the left and right to talk to one another and kind of american political space and so there's there are several groups in there that i've seen um the better the better angels project um is one example um and in all these cases the goal is actually to get people to be in like your living room sized conversations right like manageable [1095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1095.12s)

conversations and to give people uh reflective metacognitive kind of toolkits that help them kind of go in with the right frame of mind and so those kinds of things i think are 100 worth doing and it's it's actually not a huge difficult technical problem to solve it actually requires [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1117.919s)

a bare minimum of facilitation and training and against certain reflective tools that allow people to pull back from the reactive fall into bad faith tactics and kind of remind themselves of the higher purpose of why they're talking to their neighbors right you can't you know it's like it's unlikely your [1137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1137.44s)

neighbors are actually insane even though on facebook though you'd be led to believe because they have that bumper sticker they're probably insane or something right so we have to pull back from the reactive bad faith tactics that have us create this circle of people it's not worth communicating with and the best way to do that is to re-humanize people and bring them together and so there's i've seen a lot of work in that space in the political sphere and then of course in education reform you know the teacher-student relationship the way school communities run um you know this is another place where although they're not kind of it's not going under this rubric as it were of bad faith good faith it's still about you know uh restructuring the interpersonal spaces in school so that kids feel less coherenced and that teachers feel less coerced and that there's actually a you know [1187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1187.2s)

good faith participation uh in uh learning um together and and by the way you know real learning requires good faith cooperation between teacher and student uh that's like a prerequisite so so that's some like vague examples and and one project uh but i think it's it's a it's a space of innovation basically at this point because we're [1209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1209.6s)

um you know we have to protect the life world from colonization as hobros would say like all the strategic instruments of the system are colonizing the life world into the very fabric of our communication and so it's uh there's actually almost like a green tech kind of initiative that needs to go on with the new sphere where we begin to try to protect [1229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1229.679s)

uh the kind of you know exhaustible resources of the of the life world and some of the resources of the life world are things like trust right like trust if you can actually sap all the trust out of a society if you want you could through coercive strategic communication [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1248.64s)

you can just zap it out and so it's actually we're in a fight to protect the resources of the life world from colonization my follow-up question is if there was like a community of practitioners who wanted to get better at good faith communication uh what would their ecology of practice be [1267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1267.6s)

and this is an open question to everyone in the in the room right now um and like i'm thinking things like not only that some of the modalities that you've uh gestured towards but things like emotional agency things to cultivate emotional agency how to actually like you know structure a good argument um [1284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1284.96s)

like anything come to mind for you in that regard the first thing that comes to mind is just that it's you know getting together a small group like a family or community like a like a larger house of you know 15 people or something it's fairly easy to get good faith communication going on there because [1302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1302.72s)

they're there you're dealing with individual psychopathology and things like that so you can get a family system working the the real issue here has to do with public communication and specifically public political communication or public let's say scientific communication right and this is where there's a whole other set [1323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1323.12s)

of dynamics which it's harder to know how to intervene because as a psychologist i can think okay you're in a family system where there's systematically distorted communication uh or you're in a school where there's this incredible competition between kids and everyone acts strategically towards one another um let's get small groups going where you learn what it's [1342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1342.159s)

like to just you know in good faith communicate and be interested in other people's opinions and learn to understand them and that kind of stuff but when you're looking at public communication and you know the things that occur between journalists and their audiences and between politicians speechwriters [1361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1361.6s)

and the public and in these domains this is where the concern about the sapping of trust and legitimacy from the system which becomes so profound um and so that so i'm saying like yes we can innovate in the micro and create healthy community where there's good faith among a local sangha or tribe right and then this question of how to have and it's probably like a question of governance design and [[social tech|social technology]] design how do you have a public sphere in which public communication is felt to be and actually is in good faith uh and that's a that's a deeper question [1405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1405.679s)

which i think again i i do not have an answer but i know it's an important question and would love to hear people's ideas about that actually you know because i think we kind of know how to diagnose which is to say i think we we kind of know why it is so overwhelming bad faith communication at least in part and it's not like uh it hasn't been [1425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1425.279s)

before you know the history of propaganda which is laid out pretty well in those papers i named when i started the history of propaganda shows that you know the new york times has been manipulating us for for decades uh and you know so as the you know the the agencies of government that are funded to run propaganda campaigns um so [1444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1444.159s)

it's not like it's it's a new thing but we have crossed some kind of a threshold we've crossed a threshold where we need to figure out how to rein it in and recreate the instruments of governance and communication to allow for us an accurate sense of good faith um and uh again legitimacy [1467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1467.36s)

of you know the worth wildness of continuing conversation with our fellow citizen if you have any uh ideas you can put in the google doc and feel free to comment on each other's shares i'm going to tag in some people for questions now arielle you had a question uh yeah um i guess i found it a little troubling that good faith communication is predicated on a shared belief in a mutually knowable objective truth um like that framework is kind of considered philosophically problematic and a lot of people it's considered passe like a lot of people don't embrace that framework so i'm wondering how good faith communication addresses that so i yeah i brought up habermas's formal pragmatics of communication which is a fairly you know it's a it's like a deep deeply thought out way of thinking about communication and by his definitions yes good faith requires that presupposition and it's not that it's even a nameable fact which is to say it's not that we have to agree on a scientific theory of reality it's that they're they're when we make claims like the claim [1550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1550.48s)

uh that for example this way of thinking about things as passe like when you make that claim this way of thinking about things is philosophically passe is you claiming that's an objective state of affairs or not i think you are and that's cool and i agree that you're right it is in post-modernism passe but habermas is saying that [1570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1570.0s)

you can't really get communication off the ground uh without at least a presupposition that there's some shared objective world we may not be able to understand it well but it's worth communicating about it like if we were fixing a shed together or fixing a bicycle and we were making co-reference you know [1586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1586.32s)

through indexacles uh in a kind of deeply pragmatic way about an object that we're collaborating to try to fix we would just assume that there's a pretty reliable objective reality that one could be wrong or right about because either the bike would run or it wouldn't run and so in that sense it's like that kind of basic stuff and if you're operating [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1605.6s)

in bad faith you won't be able to fit the bike so you won't be able to fix the bike together really there would be a limited like little space where you're cooperating at least enough to agree on like how the bike works um so and but then that's hobromacian you don't even have to go there in the [1622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1622.64s)

definition that's in the paper it doesn't really assume that there's a there's an objective reality it just assumes that there's enough uh agreement in the basic quote-unquote good faith that's worth continuing the conversation that you don't want to cut off conversation in the interest of purely strategic action [1640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1640.559s)

that there's that baseline of agreement you know so that would be my my answer which seems decision not satisfied which is good i guess i guess part of my question was also about the unpopularity of that [1660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1660.32s)

philosophy like it does seem like it almost seems like there's like a labeling of everyone who has like a post-modern framework as being in bad faith which seems like a little bit of a maybe a misunderstanding yeah no oh no i mean it's not that's not the case most people don't [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1679.039s)

operate in bad faith all the time that's not the case and uh you know beaudriard like simulation simulacra that work as a remarkable work and offered in good faith to try to help us get out of this simulation it's one of the most deeply post-modern works um but you end up in a performative [1701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1701.679s)

contradiction a lot um which is when your your your arguments rely upon for example a fax stating discourse about the world but then you say fascinating discourses actually don't exist but that's right there you're stating some kind of fact that it doesn't exist so there's a performative contradiction [1719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1719.76s)

which once post-modernism got going was pointed out by others including habermas and uh and so in that sense that's not that's not bad faith it's kind of a it's a mistake in the domain of pragmatics which is a theory practice problem and it's hard it's hard to name that but that i think [1739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1739.279s)

is what it is um and so it's not the case that all postmodernists are in are in bad faith um in fact most academics i don't think operate in bad faith even though they're competing but the post-modern public sphere the late capitalist kind of post-modern public sphere you could argue has has mostly been [1759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1759.76s)

overrun with bad faith communication if you combine all the effects of advertising and propaganda et cetera so maybe that helps clarify what what i was saying um evan mcmullen you had a question yeah thanks peter um [1780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1780.48s)

so my question is sort of uh in a similar vein as arielle's i think but i'm i'm interested in a specific aspect of this so to me as she was pointing out one of the most difficult aspects of having good faith communication involves the fact that we have very different cultural groups that nonetheless your physical and social proximity which seem to have adopted [1801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1801.039s)

mutually incompatible reality tunnels or working ontologies um with such fundamental different fundamentally different organizing principles and assumptions that the process of reaching any sort of common ground at all can take like many many hours days even years of of good faith dialogue and this appears to me to be the result of deliberate moves by fairly [1820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1820.96s)

savvy political and economic actors engaging in bad faith communication in order to cause the situation so um doing that requires a lot to causing the situation seems to require a lot less time investment um you know than than fixing the situation so um i'm curious about this dynamic and specifically you talked earlier about the sort of rehumanization step like [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1843.2s)

okay so i'm dealing with a guy he's got a very different worldview reality tunnel ontology what have you than me and this is going to make communication even when done in the best of faith between us very difficult so i'm i'm specifically curious about how this works in your view between this rehumanization step so i've got a guy who's coming from a very different place [1863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1863.519s)

we disagree about some almost axiomatic things in our ontologies and yet i want to have a good faith conversation where we can talk about say a local policy debate like in my small town that i live in or something productively without constantly getting pulled off into the very different assumptions we might make about value and how to realize value or some [1885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1885.919s)

something like that so um maybe you could talk a little bit about that i mean i would actually i mean what do you think because again it's very context specific so like depending on who your neighbor is where you live if you're in a rural or an urban area if the axiomatic disagreements are in [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1903.84s)

some areas as opposed to other areas and so they know that the post post conventional in general tends to like constellate for uniqueness it doesn't constellate for routineness which means it's it's a requires a high degree of like consciousness and adaptability in every conversation um that's like a very vague thing i can say uh you know as with the example with the bike if it is possible to get down to places where as in meal preparation or neighborhood cleanup or things of that nature where you're at a sensory motor and representational level kind of conversations [1946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1946.24s)

and then build trust in those areas and often also recognize weaknesses and unwillingnesses in those areas you know you know the left right divide in the united states often is also the divide between the talking classes and the kind of classes that actually manipulate physical objects in space [1966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1966.159s)

like your plumbing right and so bridging the divide between the talking classes and those classes that manipulate the physical world requires often getting down to what they what what can be shared in common which is some kind of you know radically local problem and but yes at the level of axiomatic [1987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=1987.519s)

abstractions where both parties have been propagandized since what age five uh how long will it take to actually bridge those very abstract ideological differences you know that can take a long time which is why you have to have some kind of foundation of cooperation on a shared project that's in both of your interests to solve that needs to be solved regardless of those commitments and axiomatic kind of basically you know thought-terminating cliches you've collected from years of being propagandized and advertised into being unable to think for yourself right which is you know the question of how to get out of that simulation and into conversations about reality um is a hard conversation to have because the simulation is deep right so this is essentially the exact type of situation i'm asking about because i do a lot of shared projects with hands kind of stuff right like i um you know local farms that kind of [2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2049.52s)

thing like going fixing things doing stuff for people building stuff that that's i have good relationships with a lot of people who might disagree with me um pretty strongly on the higher level abstract stuff founded on that type of interaction and yet i noticed that there seems to be a very sort of you know triggered limbic hijacked whatever you want to call it kind of response when [2070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2070.48s)

like a certain barrier of non-locality is crossed and this barrier can become crossed even when talking about extremely local and relevant um you know say policy issues right where you essentially can come pretty close to inductively pointing at and how available should be treated in local communities uh despite the fact [2103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2103.52s)

that you may have you know built a shed with this dude or whatever yeah totally man yeah and then again i act this is an open this is an open question i mean i think um you know a few things worth saying is that the concept of teacherly authority is not [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2118.96s)

irrelevant here which is to say uh in both directions both parties usually have something to teach the other and you know the question of how to arrange for context again it's not just up to you you need a container where there's an allowance for a reciprocating teacherly [2137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2137.119s)

authority and in those specific in the abstract domains which means uh you know um agreeing to be you know quote-unquote exposed to ideas that you disagree with right you didn't say that but like that's one of the ways you think about not engaging [2156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2156.24s)

in good faith communication is to say that it's actually dangerous to be exposed to for example people's conspiracy theories or something right so like that willingness to have some kind of reciprocation in these asymmetric knowledge transfers which is teacherly authority so again [2175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2175.68s)

i'm being very abstract because you know it's a case-by-case basis i believe and when we're at this level and again we're still talking about the micro when you look at the macro which is to say how to change the types of media conversations and journalistic coverages and speech writing and things so that so that down [2196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2196.079s)

here at the micro it becomes less problematic right because it's there's the relation between the state of the public culture and the state of our minds as we try to to speak to one another so i'll kind of leave it at that but uh again i don't have answers i'm actually interested in if people have tried strategies you know [2216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2216.079s)

thank you evan um katie uh you had a question um yeah so when i was hearing you speak a couple ideas were coming up in my mind um the the big issue that i see is that bad faith communication tends to be really punchy [2240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2240.839s)

and sticky and memeable and like certain types of it anyway and that's kind of why people do it because it it resonates more in public minds and it's easier it's it's more easily spreadable um on mass than nuanced good faith communication steel manning [2262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2262.96s)

your opponents etc another thing is that if someone who's promoting ideas that you agree with is using these bad faith communication tactics it for a lot of people it makes them feel good because it's like oh i have this sick burn on my opponent and it kind of like rallies the troops um so i was wondering if [2283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2283.04s)

in your ideas on good faith communication you've given thought to um communicating in ways that are both in good faith but also still highly uh spreadable um and like very punchy or is that against the purpose and if it is like how can we expect it to win [2305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2305.68s)

i know it's a good it's an excellent question because it's kind of like saying that um you know we're so used to being exposed to advertisement and propaganda which is literally designed to be exciting and kind of grab the limbic system and to repeat in your head and to be easily repeatable to others in speech so the notion of what i the thought [2327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2327.76s)

terminating cliche which i mentioned before which is both in advertising and propaganda just gives you a slogan and it's like a mantra and so we're used to that form of communication and we think sometimes we have a good message to give right well that we can use the same tactics to deliver the good message but the problem is that it is a medium [2347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2347.839s)

as the message kind of problem where uh you know it's not that good faith communication isn't powerful it is powerful um but because it is unwilling to uh you know even strategically in a sense hook you through uh you know [2367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2367.44s)

a certain kind of meme right but it's worth saying that uh the truth there's a hunger for the truth right now that is like it's faked in bad faith right the hunger for the truth is co-opted in bad faith uh but it's there and so in a sense when you're in a context of totalized strategic communication you end up wanting to seek out sincere communication desperately so you can be taken advantage of by bad faith actors it's bad but there's also this desire and a knowing to can tell the difference so what i think is that you know the strategy isn't to compete with bad faith tactics with a similar level of razzle dazzle right it's to be [2415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2415.119s)

able to somehow create these contexts that people can take refuge in which are like demilitarized zones where socialization can be safe right and communication can be uh as in good faith as possible right and so it it ends up being like taking the battle out of the mimetic conflict and into some kind of design problem for social space um and into some kind of asking of like how do we convene conversations how do we bring people into good faith communication let's say off [2453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2453.359s)

of [[social media]] or in different contexts where there's mediation or moderation things of that nature so that's what comes to mind first any fall kitty or i i think that that's important creating these contacts for for good faith communication that doesn't grab you um and i think that like this is an example of one such space but like for example i've seen many cases of of people who um who often like in the public sphere communicate using kind of like razzle dazzle bad faith tactics um in the private sphere or even [2501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2501.52s)

sometimes just in long-form content that they release on their same channels communicating in good faith so like i don't know like is the hope that because of the nature of these good faith spaces people when they see them will naturally be drawn to them and just leave the other stuff aside or [2524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2524.319s)

do you think that there's space for meaning an idea like a thought-stopping cliche for example yeah i mean i think that's a great idea please do that like i would love to see memes that you know do some culture jamming uh in the space of like the normalization of bad faith um uh and one thing i think i'll mention here which is art right which comes out of left field and art is in fact when done in good faith um much more powerful than any strategic meme now of course art has in large part been not large part but has been co-opted by advertising to some extent right [2567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2567.04s)

but the authentic aesthetic expression as a beacon an invitation into good faith communication uh the symbolic or imagistic aesthetic expression that's offered as a sincere cry and expressive cry that doesn't even orient towards mutual understanding strictly speaking because [2586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2586.8s)

it's an aesthetic modality again this is oprah moss's thinking right that the aesthetic allows for the altering of culture changing the mood of the culture and then you can have a different kind of conversation so it's worth mentioning that yeah many of the fixes here may not be strictly speaking as i've been suggesting in like technology and governance design that there's room for agency in the domain of the aesthetic and the artistic i think as well which is again a different fundamentally different kind of communicative act which is an expressive act of sincerity and authenticity let's say [2624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2624.88s)

uh so i'll offer that as well thank you thank you katie um this might be the the last question before we go to breakout rooms but uh julie you had a bunch of questions if you want to choose one thank you so let me just uh scroll through and [2646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2646.839s)

see which one i want to focus on yeah um so i'm really curious about what a good starting model might be for ways to look at a human system in the context of people building non-naive trust such that they can actually find things to bond on that might not go all the way [2677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2677.2s)

to the like ontological or metaphysics level or something like that so as people are you know in some contexts it will emerge naturally they got to work together for some stuff build the shed together whatever in other contexts we're trying to create a container we're trying to create a context where there can be a longer term [2693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2693.52s)

learning relationship together people that support each other in the practice of good faith communication so what what are some ways of thinking about a human system like a human that like a starting model that enables us to more non-naively look at how do we actually build that trust you know the [[nervous system]] level psychological level um but but of course you know take that whatever you like yeah i mean that's a it's a foundational question um and uh you know i believe that you know this is one of the reasons we need psychology sociology and humanities and [2735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2735.76s)

other dimensions of kind of self-understanding of the species how do we deepen our understanding of ourselves so that we can actually build and create environments that allow us to be you know i don't know the right healthy [2756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2756.72s)

or um non-uh you know non-[[self-terminating]] at least at the level of psychopathology and civilizational um you know design so in that sense i think the question you're asking is a d1 which one can't solve in the back of a napkin you know [2776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2776.96s)

like here with you like it's about uh what do we really think the need to how how does the human psyche work how you know which is a complex how do relationships function yeah it's like it's kind of that simple and now the problem is that the [2796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2796.56s)

the academic production of psychiat psychological and sociological research has been part of this whole fourth fifth generational warfare that's been unfolding since the cold war right so there's like a full stop when you do propaganda research and realize how deep uh and how interesting the relationships are with some of our basic institutions [2816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2816.64s)

um and so what we're looking at here is a situation where although the basic questions we're asking are in psychology sociology anthropology archaeology places like that um putting together coherent pictures is difficult um and uh so so i leave it at that it's like a research project uh i have my own thoughts and work in metapsychology and and have ways of thinking about the human um but you know it's it's a it's a large project um sometime under the heading of you know ontological design or value sensitive design [2856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2856.24s)

which is you know think and this is the next conciliant's paper to draw which will be basically probably this weekend which will be about the nature of technology and how to design you know you want to design technology that factors second and third order effects on human minds and cultures and relationships uh and so in that sense this question of [2875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2875.599s)

how do we design it well we have to take a step back and think how does a human how do [[value system|value systems]] work right how do values interpenetrate with behavior and relationship and how does introducing something like a smartphone have effects on value and culture completely unpredictable [2893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2893.92s)

like you just thought you were going to get people you know able to order food and like communicate but in fact you've changed our [[nervous system|nervous systems]] to the extent that we off-board things like navigation to a gps right and then forget how to find our way around um which wasn't an intended consequence of the technology they didn't intend to [2916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2916.48s)

to degrade our spatial awareness with a gps but it was it was a side effect of gps and so that question of ontological design is how does one deeply consider thinking through sometimes we call it axiological design axiology is about the study of value so axiological design is concerning you know factoring human value and [[human nature]] a quote unquote for lack of a better term in technology design um at least as important or more important than like how much money it will make if you're if you if you release it which in many senses is the more [2954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2954.079s)

fundamental question guy designed due to venture capital speculation and other things in the tech industry which makes it have to return profit so the concern there is making money as opposed to shaping humanity and fundamentally shaping the presuppositions of what is valuable what is where should i how and steward my [2975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2975.839s)

attention right which is it which is a sacred question that we've given over to these technologists so so you're asking the right question and um you know uh get back to me when you've uh when you've gotten into the you know into the research and the [2994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=2994.16s)

literature my friend i have one follow-up that's cool peter all right um so i've actually gotten a lot of value from the metapsychology talks you've done here at the stoa and had been working on something that just sort of naturally came up for me that very [3012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3012.0s)

fit well with your model of uh installment development and transcendence which i've been simplifying to a think field do for my own [[sensemaking]] and and what struck out to me from what you've just shared as like kind of like well you know we can't predict all the outcomes of the [[social system|social systems]] they're not controllable and i'm thinking about like what what models or practices or processes maybe a model as a practice or a model as a process you know afford the flowing with the uncertainty and the unpredictable nature of how these social dynamics and psychic dynamics and will will interact um kind of like what affords us ease [3059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3059.68s)

even though we generally culturally um have a strong desire for like i want certainty i want control i want the perfect model i want it to be all sort of like top-down ebola um and you know legible to every academic institution so i bring that in but i'm just gonna share a tiny bit of personal context just say this is directly to me relevant [3081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3081.44s)

i use that i use this thinking this think feel do model to think about how does my system flow in a given interaction how is it flowing right now am i like feeling my words am i doing something from that feeling is there thinking involved are they synergistic enough and it's becoming a practice for me in a way that feels relevant to cultural [3101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3101.68s)

context and work and a lot of other areas and lastly sorry for my long answer from that from saying i got a lot out of this it's actually also personal for me i want to say one one drop i'd like to make into the collective conversation is something like you know if our [[sensemaking]] in academia is going so fast so fragile so competitive that it can't slow down to have people come in to see what is the process what is the interdisciplinary communication that actually works can we find something that allows us to deal with all the complexity uncertainty as a process and not a clinging to control um yeah that feels really important to me [3144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3144.079s)

and i'm and i'm somehow kind of asking like yeah how do we how do we insert processes that are translatable maybe the think field do has a has a let's build a bike together equivalent of like you know you know different words for the same process that are at the object level of building a bike we're at the object level of [3162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3162.48s)

let's get sociology and psychology and physics talking to each other or something so that's what i'd like to drop in as part of our ongoing inquiry interesting yeah so there's a lot there um so two things i'll pull out one is that the need for transdisciplinary work on the [[metacrisis]] that transcends and includes ongoing academic work at universities is quite a dire need so this notion of what are the higher order collaboration processes that enable academics from different disciplines to agree on a definition of the [[metacrisis]] well enough to actually create usable knowledge that's truly [3204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3204.16s)

transdisciplinary which is the only way to go and international by the way and so that's key and the problems uh you know donald campbell was thinking about this back in the 60s one of my great psychologists so there's a lot of good thinking in the field here about transdisciplinarity [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3223.28s)

but there are barriers uh having to do with you know things as simple as how universities are structured as businesses and other things that stop certain types of innovation occur but there is a lot of work going on in that area and then the other one is a deeper [3241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3241.92s)

question which is kind of like how the hell do you get used to not knowing what's going on or what's going to happen which is important because at least you've admitted that you don't know what's going to happen you don't know exactly what's going on and that's very important to get when you're thinking about designing social spaces or technologies is that the world is in such a complex state right now that it's very difficult to predict second third order effects that there's cause for pause constantly and in the metapsychology there's a certain level of complexity [3276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3276.24s)

in developmental modeling that allows you to think about that [[complexity science]] right like we actually know how chaos works in a complex cognitive way but then another domain of installment there's also a certain maturity a capacity to hold discomfort [3294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3294.24s)

to hold depression to hold confusion and anger which comes from unresolvable problems in the noetic space which are will not be resolved sorry like polarities exist that are meant to be unresolved that create tension that create growth and then of course in transcendence that's the easiest way to [3314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3314.0s)

deal with uncertainty is to you know move into a domain of symbolic immortality through the augmentation of awareness to basically hold you know the unchanging um underneath the fact that you have no idea what's gonna happen uh and so that's emotional self-regulation [3334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3334.4s)

at a very basic level in the face of basically what is ultimately a fear of death which is why you want to control so so there's a lot in that space to think about um and again one of the things that kind of characterizes post-conventional kind of post-cynical non-naive good faith is the improvisational [3355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3355.44s)

attentiveness to emergent uniqueness and possibility which is a mouthful but it's the refusal to put people into stereotypical categories uh and the refusal to like close down possibility in conversation so it's this kind of like almost a kind of outrageous opening or kind of like uh irrational opening [3378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3378.24s)

uh to exploration um which is again needs to be done post-cynical non-naive you don't want to open yourself up to a psycho right but you do want to have a change in stance which requires not just cognitive development but you have these dynamics of insolvent and transcendence [3396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3396.799s)

to bring it into my model but there's other models you could use in psychology to think through you know similar problems um the think field do is is another triple in psychology that was used uh by steiner for example rudolf steiner that's the basis of his model so if you want to expand your explorations of metapsychology to steiner's [3414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3414.319s)

psychology you would find there the think field do triple awesome thank you julie so we're going to stop the q a now and we're going to go to uh breakout rooms if you have any kind of questions that you'd like zach or daniel to read or any ideas feel free to put it on this google doc um and zach before we let people in uh i asked you what kind of uh what's something you might want to get from the [[collective intelligence]] here um and yourself and you mentioned something about uh personal practices on how to deal with um good faith or how to cultivate good faith communication um is there anything you'd like to elaborate that or anything you think [3452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3452.72s)

would be a good seat for the conversations we have in the breakout room i mean we talked about a lot and that came up repeatedly where i was kind of trying to say hey i don't actually know what you know post-cynical non-naive good faith communication looks like in your context in on [[social media]] where it needs to take place so to me that's a very open question like for exploration and innovation i even think it's like a it's a space of almost like entrepreneurial ambition should be put into figuring out how to create spaces where people can actually communicate in good faith or be trained to have certain way of [3488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3488.4s)

relating to this environment that's trying to manipulate them um through political propaganda advertising etc so so yeah anything there in the domain of uh yeah examples from your own experience richly textured anthropological data would be very useful just like stories about bad faith communication and how one counter did one time and it was [3510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3510.48s)

successful where that level of like exploring what works because the environment's so novel so um it's quite an open invitation i would suppose awesome um and uh i know you're gonna slip out now zach any parting words you'd like to leave us with before you head out [3528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qeN7mdLNM&t=3528.64s)
