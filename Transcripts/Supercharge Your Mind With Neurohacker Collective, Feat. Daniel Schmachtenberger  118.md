music all right so here we are with daniel schmuck dan berger good to see you did good to see you my friend thanks for having us into your home i look forward to this conversation thanks for thanks for coming yeah we're gonna we're gonna go deep here my friend so i'm just gonna jump right in a couple things that i've learned about you from reading about you and listening to you on other shows is [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=22.05s)

that you were homeschooled that's true and at the same time you're a really bright guy who is very knowledgeable and articulate i would consider you and i don't throw this term around but i would consider you to be someone that's highly intelligent to the point where you could be called brilliant and i don't call everyone brilliant you're a really smart guy so why did your parents elect to home-school you and what impact does that had on your yeah on your you know a mental acuity so it was a educational experiment my parents were interested in and my dad particularly spent his life thinking about educational philosophy and human potential and how do we actually actualize human potential better and my mom had shared interests [67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=67.08s)

in different skills and so they they decided to take it on together and the experiment was what happens if we give a kid no curriculum at all no fixed curriculum so i didn't have english and social studies in mathematics and but just expose them to everything possible facilitate their interests and see what happens and so that was the experiment and having gone through the whole [92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=92.04s)

experiment we could do it much better now there were parts that learned along the way but the effective parts that i would say we're a successful experiment is every kid has profound fascination with life in their own ways and we usually do a good job of breaking it and we also usually do a good job of training them not to think well so little kids ask what is that what is [119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=119.659s)

that what is that at first right it's the first question they're getting the anatomy of universe down and then why why why and the depth of why run into philosophically and physically need questions that we usually don't know how to answer and so we give them we just don't answer them or give them  __  answers what made-up answers yes yeah but or [139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=139.4s)

some less conscious parents who say because i said so yeah because it just is or god made it that way or whatever so when ready to asks why is the sky blue and most adults realize they don't actually know something that is that fundamental to our experience every day right and all human experience they either say i don't know how do you spell cat right like to [161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=161.15s)

move it into the domain of the gnome but they move it from something that was fundamental about the nature of universe to something that wasn't and so if you really want to explain why the sky is blue you have to understand that our upper atmosphere is made of nitrogen and oxygen and the percentage of it and nitrogen specifically as n2 and how molecules work and how light coming from [180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=180.47s)

the sun works and the speed of light and diffraction and understanding what optics is and it like there's a lot of deep things and then the wait that's why it is that specific wavelength but why do i subjectively experience it as blue so now we're looking at the mind brain interface right and the relationship between consciousness and physics and kids want to know that right they want [199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=199.13s)

to know why is fire hot which again is a  __  deep question and they're like every kid asks these things and since we don't know we don't facilitate what they're naturally fascinated in that it passed me by and we force them to be interested in stuff that is totally not interesting and in doing so we don't teach them the interesting things we don't teach them the things that are [219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=219.8s)

foundational about life that actually lead to the ability to understand everything else and we actually break their interest in life which is why then they just want to veg out and watch tv or you know the the whole welfare person phenomena who yeah is actually i was gonna say they become great taxpayers but see those are broken people that's the key insight is that everyone is born [239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=239.72s)

fascinated interested and if you facilitate that then not only are you helping them learn a tremendous amount and you're and they're gonna be fussing about different things some more in the direction of aesthetics or ethics or fundamental science or athletics or but there will be a unique genius actualization if it's followed and so that was the experiment and we could go [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=260.09s)

on about educational philosophy but one of the key like insights there is that we have an educational system in the us right now and in most of the west it was built in the [[industrial revolution]] to make industrial pots brand it was there thank you no i love going here i was hoping i'd hoping we could get into this so carry on please and so as we started to look at building [281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=281.46s)

industrial [[supply chain|supply chains]] then we wanted every assembly line worker before we had automated that task to basically be anatomica right they would do the exact same thing and so anyone who had been trained into doing that could be replaceable they were fungible for anyone else and any mba from a good business school was replaceable for any other mba any vp of [303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=303.57s)

marketing and so we want to take unique humans and collapse them into fungible roles and so then we can just have an org chart and say i'm looking for three of these and four of these totally replaceable in the process of doing that when you collapse the uniqueness of a human into a fungible role there's of course the intrinsic motive to do that is gone deep competition in comparison [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=323.34s)

because we're competing on being the exact same role so we're competing on the same metrics rather than any uniqueness like there's no way to compare salvador dali and mc escher and davinci because how the  __  would you do that right like there you can't compare them on the same metrics and if like if dali hadn't done what he did some other artists wouldn't have done [344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=344.03s)

the same thing universe would just have been less that was the uniqueness of that being expressing in a totally  __  unique way which is why all the artists for history hadn't done that thing and so so much of the jealousy and the comparison competition also comes from being collapsed to categories and there were reasons why we did this as we you know for all of human history until [363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=363.36s)

not that long ago until the beginning of what we call civilization ten thousand years ago give or take for eight million years of hominid history we never had got more than 150 people and those hundred and fifty person tribes every one could be pretty unique and actually get along well because they knew everybody else and they could actually keep track of it and as soon as you want [382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=382.979s)

to go to start having very large numbers we had to create some homogeneity between everyone so we started making them a lot more like termites or ants which are animals that can do a lot of them working together but within a class a worker ant row they're all fungible right they're all replaceable for each other so this system is very much like that in [400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=400.92s)

education is the indoctrination and to be going from a unique human to a fungible boughten dude you just described my hole in a very deeply intellectual way my whole experience subjectively with education and it the whole time you're talking about caste and this is why i do what i do because i'm so curious and so fascinated by by the way things work and what they the [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=427.95s)

questions of why right and so i was always seeking truth even as a kid like how does this work why does it work but the system that i was put into and literally physically the desks i was put into we're like little torture chambers and and my creativity was actually discouraged and and was you know almost forced you know forced to join the basketball team because i was having [456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=456.78s)

behavioral problems and their solution was like cool make him conform to something that makes him even more insecure and feel like even more of an outsider being the kid with the long hair and refusing to wear the right shoes so i wore my vans and slid around the court and got made fun of and you know harassed and picked on and stuff like that and it's like once i turned [473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=473.64s)

the day turned 18 i quit high school i was marking it off on my calendar like a prisoner you know putting notches on the wall is like marking the calendar talk tober 29th 1988 and that was the day of freedom and from that moment on once i left school then i became obsessed with learning and so it's so interesting to look from the standpoint of your perspective because it wasn't that i [495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=495.57s)

didn't want to learn it's that i didn't want to learn that way that those topics those topics and that way yes and so now it's like you know here i'm 47 and i'm like i'm like the most curious child like energy i think there is i mean i don't know anyone that's as curious is me about the way things work and it's such a gift to be able to interview people yeah and and really learn about [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=518.25s)

this stuff so so that's so no note how fortuitous that your parents you know you were so situated that your parents got that right you had an opportunity to take different paths now is because you didn't actually identify you you didn't actually succeed at school in that way that you were able to actually do something else to the degree you succeed at it then you're trapped by the continuation of that curve forever so notice the smarter the kids are smart meaning good at that particular definition of smart the earlier we push them in the hyperspecialization right we want to get them in ap classes towards their specialty young and then the further we push them in [557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=557.1s)

specialization so by the time they do their dissertation 10 people in the world know what the  __  they're talking about so they know so much about such a narrow area so they're not thinking about big picture things or thing interdisciplinary things at all that means that the smartest people aren't actually questioning macroeconomics and questioning culture and questioning [578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=578.63s)

governance questioning the foundational axioms of how we do academia or science because they're they're just doing one tiny little thing so we're training them to be very sharp cogs in the industrial way yeah that's true and the only people are usually left thinking about any big picture things are people that didn't have those types of proclivities and that is that your way of taking things [599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=599.49s)

that could be dangerous and making them not only not dangerous but very good tools of the continuation of a particular system and so because you didn't actually do that well at it then you were able to say  __  i don't want to do something totally different right well that that it's interesting it reminds me of something i've talked about on the show and there was this i [618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=618.449s)

gotta find this freaking it was some study or evaluation or paper or something that i came across at one point and it was talking about entrepreneurship and how the top 10 people with the highest iqs in the world all work for someone else and all the great inventors and the you know monumental colossal entrepreneurs in the world dropped out of high school didn't [639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=639.3s)

go to college i mean it's this universal trend that the smartest people don't think outside of the box and it's the theory was that the people that you're describing that are highly specialized and that rise to the top of their class intellectually that they're so smart that they're able to over calculate the risks involved in event of creativity whereas if you have a more [662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=662.59s)

of a visionary creative type that doesn't fit within that box but also obviously still has a certain degree of intellectual prowess that they're smart enough to have the idea and creative enough to have the vision but just dumb enough to not be able to calculate the risk and be willing to go out and walk the plank and lose it all for the sake of so saying dumb enough is one way of [683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=683.47s)

thinking of it another way of thinking of it has to do with the way they're trained in relationship to risk aversion okay okay i like that cuz i i think of myself as that and i tend to be self-deprecating so i appreciate you seeing in an nlp wave seen that word dumb enough so what is really happening think about this if the kid who gets a 4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is [706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=706.66s)

making no mistakes right like that's how you that's how you write that is that you need everything right and everything perfect now everything right means you learned what had already been figured out was the orthodox truth and you were able to repeat it effectively right and then at a certain point once you understand that system completely enough you can extend it a little bit which you [731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=731.14s)

know in the postdoc level you take the current whatever the field is an extended a tiny bit after proving that you understood it you know perfectly people who got a lot of praise and a lot of success and identity around never making any mistakes and getting everything perfect are not oriented to do things that have a very high risk of failure that's great [755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=755.71s)

so true so when when kids are praised for getting things right you  __  them up because a number of things one so think about this in general all the praise that kids get is when they do something that the authority wants them to do and has already designated as right and good and true right so whether it's the teacher the preacher of the parents they get praised for doing what [780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=780.49s)

someone else wanted them to do they almost always get punishment for doing things that made sense to them that they wanted to do so this is how you conditioned people to be well you know cogs within an authoritarian system where we defer our own agency our ability to assess the world in our own agency to somebody that knows better than us and the teacher the [803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=803.13s)

preacher the parent right they all represent that and then it becomes the boss and the you know macroeconomy the state the etc writ large and so if we want people that actually can really be innovative we can't train them that way we have to train them to self assess and self initiate and not actually get hits of praise from getting something right that others already figured out and when [829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=829.44s)

we do that like oftentimes there's a kid who becomes a spelling bee champion or math genius because they just happen to  __  figure out like how spelling works or how math works and they got so much praise for it and they weren't getting enough unconditional love otherwise that they were optimizing for the extrinsic reward associated with the math of getting the prey is even though [849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=849.84s)

they might actually hate math or be not terribly interested in that they just happened to get it if you didn't do that then you might find math is alright but they're actually fascinated by art and so then they can become very good at something they have no passion for and it's all based on extrinsic motive that is damaging intrinsic motive why do you have kids i don't have kids like you get great dad dude i was picturing your kid man they're gonna be so well developed if and when you have them i don't i don't i don't either and i think partially because i'm like terrified of not doing a good job of it because i still feel like i'm doing so much work on myself but it's it's interesting to think about a generation [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=892.77s)

of people close to our age that have an understanding of things in this way that can actually assure in the next generation of human that is allowed to express their full potential without being confined into this system and and most of the people that have the deepest have have had the deepest exploration about the nature of reality either aren't having kids because they see [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=919.17s)

how much is wrong with the world and they're applying that creative and parental energy to trying to solve problems in the world or they don't feel secure enough in the world with nuclear war looming again for the first time in macroeconomic collapse and [[climate change]] etc to want to bring kids in so yep so ok so moving on into i mean i there's so much i mean there's stuff [945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=945.26s)

literally so much to unpack in any one of these topics but there's so many things i want to cover with you but the education thing definitely piqued my interest just learning that you were homeschooled but you're a really bright guy so where's the connection and that's making sense now what about see i didn't go to college to me higher education was moved to hollywood play in a band deal [963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=963.32s)

drugs done i mean i had it figured out so i thought then i went to la cc for like two weeks i took health and which you know later i guess came to serve me if i only made it two weeks and i took health and classical guitar i was like oh cool learn how to play rad guitar go in there like oh we're gonna learn how to read music i was like no that's math i'm out but when i look at higher [982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=982.58s)

education now just from what i see in [[social media]] there's this just where we are culturally is so interesting because this millennial generation i read something the other day for example that they surveyed a bunch of millennials and 50% of them indicated that they would prefer communism over capitalism you know and there's this whole post-modernism and and marxist ideas and [1005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1005.55s)

all this to me really crazy stuff that this seemed to have seeped its way into higher education and you have this generation of kids that are in this weird orwellian 1984 thought police political correct insanity like what's the deal with with that right now and do you know what i'm talking about and yeah and do you think this has been perpetuated intentionally or is this [1030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1030.189s)

just a natural progression of a plus b equals c and how things have carried on alright that's it like quite a few really deep topics mixed together and unwound yeah so post-modernism as one topic in its relationship to higher education okay the trend of higher education writ large and the other issue beyond post-modernism looking at macro [1055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1055.46s)

economy and questioning capitalism and looking at other macroeconomic systems and generational dynamics that millenials are expressing are all important and they're somewhat tight but they're also some different dynamics so in my classic interview style i just asked six questions under one umbrella yeah so we'll take a stab at any part of that to me i'm just you know i'm very [1077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1077.42s)

zoomed out and i'm looking at things that i see like that like we kids don't understand communism doesn't work how did we get there you know it's just it's so bizarre to me in this whole i don't know the climate of so there's free speech being crushed unless they people agree with you like the sensitive snowflake weird safespace whole college thing okay so the issue as i see it is [1099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1099.14s)

actually quite nuanced and complex and most of the reactionary simplistic takes on it are part of the problem so let's explore this nuance all right cool so let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender lgbtq we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity [1126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1126.95s)

politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was [1158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1158.45s)

fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in london we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they [1178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1178.55s)

do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral  __  problem - having your moral legitimacy as the united states of america beautiful constitution declaration of independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after germany's genocide they're  __  up right there's a whole cultural thing [1197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1197.66s)

but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the native american people employing the slavery of the africans and we mean real  __  slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want [1220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1220.37s)

to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of chinese slavery a lot of african slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1248.12s)

dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got jim crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the  __  work [1272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1272.45s)

and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the  __  jobs and who wants to  __  jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and [1288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1288.97s)

they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance [1316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1316.1s)

right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice  __  yes we [1335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1335.7s)

still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and i which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but i don't get a cut and pick right if i cut and pick there's [1356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1356.61s)

something  __  up or you can cut and i'll pick but anyone who says i wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1376.53s)

clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone [1399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1399.18s)

go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely [1422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1422.43s)

arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere [1449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1449.37s)

because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey  __  everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science [1466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1466.29s)

that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst i'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge [1488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1488.16s)

that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a  __  ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post martin said actually different perspectives on reality running [1509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1509.669s)

different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet i can show you just as much  __  research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether i'm looking at ph or i'm looking at insulin levels or i'm looking at telomere levels like i'll get different answers and also which [1530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1530.58s)

populations but when i try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million  __  metrics that we can't calculate i can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because i'm studying a very [[complex system]] in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a [[complex system]] in a simple way because your metrics look really  __  clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of [1571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1571.679s)

them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth [1590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1590.39s)

as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read foucault [1617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1617.9s)

or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so [1635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1635.63s)

when i say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for [1664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1664.85s)

whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the british to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had  __  muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level [1683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1683.2s)

where you have decentralized [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to  __  deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives [1706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1706.46s)

they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part that makes [1727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1727.88s)

perfect sense because to me looking from the outside i'm like i i see the trauma and i see that these young people that are wrapped up in that ideology i see them as victims you know and but i didn't think about the past i'm just like your victims of a perspective that you've adopted and i guess because there was trauma and i'm just like god it feels so bad that this kid thinks the [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1754.16s)

communism works it's just like okay so now i want to address this part yeah when in the depression there were people openly on the streets discussing socialism marxism lazy fair capitalism because the system was failed right you in a failed state people are open to like look at any possibility we are very near a failed state and we're actually very near a failed civilization globally [1780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1780.11s)

so when you look at [[climate change]] and the fact that we can't  __  get it right right like we can't get it right we we keep driving ourselves towards the point of self induced catastrophe and possibly extinction and despite the fact that the club of rome identified this over shooting limits in this 60s right and and limits of growth in the world through model the spoon despite the fact [1804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1804.35s)

that it's been called that we're following the model we keep progressing on the  __  model right the paris accord was not enough for us to make it we would have everything would have been  __  if we did the paris accord and we couldn't even do that right and so and that's driven mostly by our current structure of capitalism because if i over fished the ocean right [1822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1822.73s)

if i use a mile long drift net and i take all these  __  fish out of the ocean that's more money for my fishing company this quarter and leaving them in the ocean is worth nothing to me economically now it's worth something in the future but the other guy is going to fish them out if i don't fish them out so it's not like i can leave them there for the future so it is a competitive [1844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1844.79s)

race for near-term wins mortgaging the future so we make thirteen species a day extinct on average we've fished out 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a 3/4 water planet that took 3 billion years to get all that  __  life and in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we fished out 90% of the large fish species extincted many of them 80% of the old-growth trees gone that's capitalism working really great not working really great right we're on the verge of a very realistic ai apocalypse where we should be developing the area very slowly we should be very intelligently looking at what it because unlike you know when when edison's working on a light bulb and light bulb fails it just doesn't [1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1886.23s)

work maybe it blows up no big deal you do it inside of a container you work on ai and it fails and sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it kills everything because it is an autopoietic tech it is a self-organizing self authoring tech light bulb isn't it works or it doesn't work but it's built on the outside but but biotech right where you make a new  __  life-form and now it replicates [1908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1908.61s)

and it does its own mutation that is a self-replicating tech where if you get it wrong you don't get a stop it and nuclear wasn't right nuclear is a reaction and then it stops it's really bad but nanotech biotech and ai are autopoietic self-replicating tech that might be depending upon how we do them in commensurate with biological life as we understand it with faster feedback [1932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1932.61s)

loops than us now we should develop that as slow as  __  possible because the upsides are awesome but we should do it in highly controlled safe to fail environments but all of the fiscal incentive is getting to market first that's a capitalist incentive who gets to market first where we're in a race towards the cliff and the [[arms race]] is the same thing why do we have when carl [1953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1953.22s)

sagan showed us in the early 80s that it only took four 100-megaton bombs to kill all life on earth with a nuclear winter why do we have 600 times that many like why the  __  do you keep making nukes after you have enough to kill everything down to viruses because if you have a for-profit military-industrial complex where you have a source of supply where you need to manufacture more demand to [1972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1972.72s)

keep your supply going it's not like supply and demand is a real thing there's an initial demand you create a supply but now you you have supply and you manufacture artificial demand which is why we buy all kinds of  __  that doesn't make us happy that we think will make us happy because marketing creates artificial bland so capitalism is actually broken [1987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=1987.41s)

existentially so there are people who learned that okay marxism had some nice ideas and there were some good ideas it didn't actually end up working out that well no of course if we really go study if we never implemented marxism just like we've never implemented lazy faire capitalism we've implemented weird models of capitalism and by the time the ussr came [2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2007.04s)

around it was nothing like marxism for a bunch of reasons but marxism doesn't actually work at scale it it works that kind of model works at a hundred and fifty person tribal model it doesn't extend beyond it capitalism did seem to work but of the cost of radical externality that externality when you get to this many people in this much tech actually self implodes so what has [2027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2027.95s)

worked up to this point worked worked epic at but you when we say it worked up to this point we have been utilizing unknowable resources moving towards the point of criticality the whole time and it has required war right and it has led to diseases we didn't have before because of environmental devastation and etc and we have a world war today almost everyone has low-grade mental illness [2053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2053.659s)

like luba quit asst addiction ubiquitous low-grade anxiety existential angst fairly decent low-grade depression right these are not natural to the human condition tribal people don't have this  __  in the same way so we say it works define work this is optimizing for some metrics at the expense of others in a [[complex system]] so the fact that there are people questioning is there a [2081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2081.02s)

 __  better system than this because we're not fixing [[climate change]] in the system where it's still more profitable to do the  __  up thing with a [[perverse incentive]] is ubiquitous in health care why do we do biohacking stuff like why doesn't health care prevent diseases because there's no  __  money in preventing diseases there's a lot of money in treating them [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2098.03s)

there's no there's not that much in curing them but there's a lot in treating them forever so what is gonna get researched when the money goes in has to have roi back out of the capitalist system so the fact that people are recognizing that in questioning is a very good thing now the fact they try to find other things that didn't work as the answer is just a [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2112.43s)

basic basically hopelessness and a lack of knowing how to go about solving something so  __  hard so one of the core foe of my life is what is the macroeconomy of the future what are the governance system sort of the civilization systems they can allow us to actually human together well without needing to go to war and unknowable use of resource and [2131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2131.51s)

producing a bit with this mental and physical illness that's unnecessary and etc and it's not any system that has ever happened so we can get into that if you want to or we can go to other directions but also most of the young people who say communism what they're really saying is denmark looks better than here like that's a social kind of dynamic [2150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2150.05s)

where better access to medicine don't have a lot of homeless people masters to phd is average level of education largely secular because of that like the nordic countries just look better they are they're just  __  better there's more socialized dynamics now are they better on every metric no if you look here we have a tremendous amount of innovation here because of certain types [2176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2176.3s)

of freedoms and a tremendous amount of damage and our bell curve is very spread out and so for everyone who's not winning at the system to say nobody is losing as bad in denmark as they are here and there's a lot less of them and they're not ruining the environment as fast they're actually figuring their trash problem out maybe let's actually think about this and i'm actually not [2199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2199.55s)

proposing denmark as a solution i am saying there are a lot of things that are actually evidentially better on meaningful metrics and things that are adequate to the scope of what do we do with almost 8 billion people and distributed [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] don't yet exist oh my god that's amazing that is a lot to unpack and it's funny because i've never [2225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2225.319s)

actually talked about any of these issues on the show it's always very much about meditation or mindfulness spirituality or just full-on health stuff but i know that you have a systems approach so kind of zooming out and looking at like whoa what's even beyond hey am i optimizing my sleep or take you know how does my blood work look this year i mean this is stuff that goes way [2247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2247.069s)

above and beyond that and where we from here which is interesting i just think it you know i earned the question because i i knew that you'd be someone that could answer it in a way that encouraged more questioning but it's such an interesting time to be alive that's like sometimes it's hard for me not to deviate from my format and the basic topics and get way off into this [2267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2267.79s)

stuff because i'm watching things happen that have never happened before as we all are right it's just such a trippy time on earth and there's so many positive things going on and i feel that there's this massive awakening thanks to people like you and shows like this and just the proliferation of information through [[social media]] through the internet but at the same time it's so [2288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2288.73s)

dark and we are on this you know as you said about to go over the waterfall i mean we are at the precipice of absolute destruction while at the same time there's this light that's really i think we're in this sort of spiritual evolution at the same time it's just so interesting so let's just for a minute yeah on the are we talking about biohacking meditation spirituality [2310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2310.74s)

individual optimization are we talking about interpersonal collective optimist well nor that's what i'm saying normally on the show it's more just subjective each person optimizing and then that rippling out into the community at large right but we've sort of like zoomed out and are coming back in from the other direction so there's a stomach model here's what we have to think about them [2330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2330.61s)

together if we work on increasing our cognitive capacity and our energy and etc so that we can do more of what's killing the world then we go extinct faster because of it all right amazing ourselves to like integrate into a system that is not working and that's most of it right like that's interesting we watched as we started you know neuro hacker we were looking at the amount of [2355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2355.18s)

smart drug sales going up and smart drugs that increased hyper competing increased motivation and drive well decreasing empathy decreasing creativity and making hyper competing psychopaths like modafinil that's like adderall adder okay but modafinil can do things in that direction and that's different i just came to i don't do adderall but i do min to have an [2382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2382.15s)

elephant and when i'm on modafinil i don't think i've become a bad person but i definitely am not interested in interfacing with other humans at all i'm like very task-oriented and locked into whatever i'm doing which has its place but it's definitely not like hey man i should go out and give some hugs right now like get out of my way don't [2399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2399.11s)

interrupt me i'm focused so how did you this is the key thing is like let's learn how to win at the game that is killing the world right no let's not do that right let's learn how to have the capacity to create a new game and that's i mean like that's really the thing that i want to emphasize here and even the people who are winning at the current game are not living happy meaningful [2422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2422.75s)

lives for the most part when we look at [[hypernormal stimuli]] right why it's so easy to get addicted to sugar because in an [[evolutionary environment]] we just didn't have sugar right we had a little bit of fruit and the fruit was not hybridized so so there was a major involved opening reaction to get it because the caloric density offered increased ability to survive a famine [2447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2447.98s)

now we have so much  __  sugar but we still the same dopamine response that that's a dangerous phenomenon i burn almost simulating and then we find that of course [[social media]] is a [[hypernormal stimuli]] cuz everybody's pictures are prettier than they actually are and everybody's liking you in you're liking them and you don't have to face like real difficulties of interaction [2464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2464.48s)

and it can be a huge number of people in a short amount of time and porn is a [[hypernormal stimuli]] and there's a whole generation of kids becoming adults who don't know how to relate to women who don't know how to have sex properly who have issues erectile and etc because they have oversaturated a certain kind of stimuli and normal stimuli are actually they're [2484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2484.64s)

insensitive to it right and video games are hypernormal sense so we've had a world that's just all hypernormals and i which is addiction which always corresponds with less fulfillment right because it's desensitizing you to actually getting pleasure from life and so you need the [[hypernormal stimuli]] to get the hit and so you need the whatever it is however many likes that your thing [2504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2504.95s)

gets her and the [[hypernormal stimuli]] proliferate sin the presence of hypo normal stimuli which is we don't live in a  __  tribe which is our [[evolutionary environment]] where we actually have real authentic interactions with lots of humans regularly and to imagine in a tribe where you're dancing around the campfire regularly most people find that [2523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2523.04s)

when they go camping with friends they aren't checking their phone as much right after the first day or two in the addiction kind of chills and of the presence of more authentic fulfillment there is less emptiness pushing some hip and so the society we've optimized for is a hyper hypo normal stimuli to everything meaningful we're we're everybody's  __  lonely and has some [2546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2546.8s)

sense of meaninglessness and a lot of pressure you know together and so then in that in that place addiction is going to run rampant and most people have 30 to 50 different addictive behaviors meaning compulsive  __  they know isn't good for them they keep doing totally that's really interesting because in the model of the 12 steps which has been them the most effective single thing in [2568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2568.369s)

removing deadly addictions from my life the model there is what i think people from the outside of that model think is that oh you go there and you quit drinking or you go there and you quit sex or overeating or whatever it is you go to some 12-step group and that that's what your problem is but that you get there as subjectively one gets there and you go oh  __  that was actually the [2590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2590.18s)

symptom right so i'm addicted to heroin well why because of everything you just described so is this just a set of principles then going to just take that addiction away know what it's going to do is it's going to give me a framework to live by spiritual principles ineffable laws right that i can apply to my life to become more fulfilled and then the need for that thing that i was [2615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2615.349s)

using goes away and it's the straight i mean i've experienced this again and again and again using that model of getting the human connection and a spiritual connection and like living by those principles that kind of keep your mind and emotions in check then that problem is removed and when the the principles represent a pretty small percent and human [2640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2640.94s)

represents a pretty large person like the group dynamic and the group support i guess that's not tribe we're missing right you walk into a room and there's 25 people in there that you might not know but they you understand one another on a deep level because you've both suffered in the same way think about it how many people get the blue book read on their own apply the principles and [2659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2659.28s)

quit their addiction no nobody that's now that's funny whether they join that group or they be joining the christian group where they join whatever  __  it's mostly the fact that we are actually social primates right involved in a travel environment and so when in the 12-step thing what's happening is the main thing happening in those rooms is you have people having authentic [2680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2680.85s)

sharing about things they don't normally get to share about so they feel seen they see other people in there's real intimacy right and most the time again the world praised us for certain very narrow things and we're optimizing for a lie all the time now just because this is adjacent to a topic i want to discuss this is one of the things that is most gruesome about [2703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2703.29s)

[[social media]] and i'll say most gruesome about the topic of personal branding and i'm using the word gruesome you know acknowledging is probably i struggle with this a lot so i'm looking forward to what you have to say when someone creates a brand as a business but even if not they're just [[social media]] and there's a persona right but let's take the brand as a very clear example [2731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2731.01s)

they're now a life coach there are yoga teacher they're an instagram model but whatever the  __  it is right which has become radically easier there used to be a few people too that would based on the media tech now everybody gets it to some degree of this then what happens is i have a feed background an analytics mechanism of how much people like my persona which is how many likes the [2750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2750.78s)

thing gets and how many clicks and impressions and purchases whatever you know thing and so i'm going to now split test optimize my persona based on what people are responding to and they're gonna respond the [[hypernormal stimuli]] and so the brand is going to get based on the financial driver based on the analytics is going to evolve in the direction of it's maximum engagement it's gonna get further and further from who i actually am there will be whole areas of who i am that i definitely don't share because they will actually be anti-correlated to what gets the like it and the more people are liking that thing now that i feel different than the more depressed i feel right the more addictive desire i have in that depression let's go ready [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2793.17s)

hit right and put out another  __  thing that's gonna get a likes and the more i feel like a fraud and a phony and that if anyone really saw me they wouldn't love me and i'm really unlovable and etc right so in the 12-step room the opposite of that's happening right someone is actually saying i'm a  __   __  up i just did all this dumb  __  me like i get it me [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2812.25s)

too yeah whoa a real human interaction just occurred yeah and which is rare yeah which is really rare and this starts to be the basis it's not sufficient right but it starts to be the basis of a human life that doesn't drive addiction as a way to deal with the emptiness right remove the emptiness and then the need to run from it goes away it's [2835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2835.29s)

interesting though as you were talking about the [[social media]] persona and the profile because i've owned a company for nine years and it's it's a company and has its own identity and then myself and my partner were the drivers or the face of that company at a certain point but then we sort of phased out as we've gone in our own separate career paths and things and mind's gone away from fashion [2855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2855.51s)

so i i really enjoy the process of building a brand and a personality and you know coming up with your core values in the mission and like it's a thing it's a living entity which has been amazing but i really struggled when i started the podcast and decided to get out of you know having this identity as a fashion stylist and a musician and all the things that i was so identified with [2874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2874.62s)

before that i don't just ran their course or weren't my true hearts passion and so i decided to do this podcast and make this brand called luke story you know i have this thing the life stylist and you know i really had a hard time with launching it there's about two years ago because i didn't know how real i wanted to be or that i would have the courage to be and how forth coming and [2896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2896.37s)

just transparent and authentic i wanted to be about my past and my struggles with addiction and just current struggles and everything and so i i kind of paused for a moment before i put anything out until i really was sure that i was willing to accept a possible rejection or other consequences of just being me and i've done this social experiment now for about a year [2922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2922.079s)

and a half where i've just pushed my my own boundaries of transparency and authenticity just to see what would happen if i am in fact disliked or rejected or abandoned or ostracized by the world at large or what we call a following or a fan base or listeners or whatever and it's been so buzard i've been talking about this a lot it's the more goofy and real and just true i can [2949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2949.069s)

be like treating [[social media]] and my outward facing persona and brand like i'm in a 12-step meeting and just like hey this is the  __  i'm going through it's a certain degree of you know prudence i guess you know i don't you don't want to be lose your tact you know what i mean but i'm finding this spiritual explosion of growth and just allowing myself to finally be seen and [2975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=2975.42s)

to really accept myself and love myself and what's so weird about it and this is just this cosmic joke that i'm just constantly giggling that is that i actually get more approval from showing these aspects of myself that i've always hidden because i was embarrassed about or you know my insecurities my struggles it's like actually people liked me more for the things that i've been afraid for [3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3000.859s)

them to see in my whole entire life it's like this strange paradox which on the other side of it i've lived that that will decide you were describing is like oh i'm going to present things in a certain way so that i'm like i'm sure that's there to some degree but i've kind of flipped that on its head and just like alright how myself can i be and what point at which do people go [3021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3021.289s)

alright you're too much we're abandoning you we actually don't like you what does that sort of you know primal egoic fear and i'm just having such a great time like using [[social media]] actually as a tool to make myself uncomfortably vulnerable yeah and then to find that it was a boogeyman it's like a phantom fear who gives a  __  if [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3040.99s)

they like you or not it's like if you have that self-worth which i'm really starting to cultivate more actively than i don't know even the response doesn't matter but it's fascinating when the response is positive two things that i would think like oh god now people are really gonna think i'm an idiot or whatever you know just letting that be seen on a on a macro more public level [3062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3062.619s)

and then it's give me the ability to do that more as you mentioned the word intimacy you know just my friends but okay i just want to be real i think it's one of my goals in life is to you know to some day pass on and if anyone could say anything just be like at least he wasn't  __  phony yeah you know it's like just to be authentic and real despite whatever false one might have so [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3083.73s)

so in the world where we have ubiquiti loneliness and liquidus depression and without talking about it everybody knows that there is a longing for authenticity right and a longing for intimacy and so people will respond to that and so that's awesome right and i love that you're having that experience with people and sharing that experience of people and anyone who wants to share [3111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3111.64s)

themselves where there will be a personal brand that's the only way to go it doesn't make their life sock and actually propagate  __  in the world now there will still be times where there is something that is less authentic that sells better and this is where you have to say okay choosing between two masters where i don't really write it's a tricky one sometimes but it's one to just have [3140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3140.77s)

continuous awareness of and vigilance of so so at a certain point when i guess you hit a threshold perhaps where you really have to start looking at things from scalability and from having a brand that's sustainable are you saying that at a certain point you are faced with the decision on editing the level of authenticity in order to our analytics say this particular market will like [3168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3168.43s)

this part of your message but not this part if you gear it like this your scales right right and understand this particular hypo normal [[hypernormal stimuli]] will get a lot of people to respond because addiction actually sells right so now come back to capitalism for a minute again in the problem of it yeah the more addicted people are the better [3187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3187.44s)

capitalism works gdp goes up with more addiction right because this is why there are not salad bars that have the scale of mcdonald's is because if we make  __  that is addictive as  __  because we just exploit the [[hypernormal stimuli]] button people will buy it and have to keep buying it and we do that with cigarettes we do it and you know a [[social media]] this is like you know when tristan harris left google and started talking about this and people started waking up to [[social media]] facebook you know or platforms of any kind google they get paid by how much time i how many eyeballs been how much time on site because the marketers are you know the advertisers are gonna pay for that so the goal is keep you have as many people spend as much time on site as possible [3235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3235.72s)

now what's actually good for you in your life is to get the  __  off of the screen and go interact with people right right but since we're gonna get paid more by more time on site then we're gonna figure out the most addictive things to do with the newsfeed that will keep you clicking and you know paying attention right as much as possible and then justify why it's a good thing [3254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3254.08s)

because we have to have to do that right and so then if you look at keep just you just described a rift in so many of my relationships you know the woman classic like what do you oh you have to be on instagram like all day i'm like hey this is my work like that's always my excuse part of my job and you know it's a it's an interesting thing because the studies keep rolling out of the more time people [3277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3277.75s)

spend on screens the more depressed they are and for a gazillion reasons right right is there for the most part there isn't any real intimacy authenticity etc and those interactions if so it's the tiniest fragment of the total time spent and even to the degree there is the real kinesthetic feedback of intimacy with another person is not happening it doesn't mean there aren't good sides of [3302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3302.53s)

course the ability to have people with people in other parts of the world and be able to have messages that are valuable be shared has value those will be the parts that we solely focus on if we have a profit stream associated with it because we need to justify that right so this is where it becomes important to really look at what is meaningful now come back for a moment to the individual [3326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3326.57s)

optimization right biohacking individual concision we're interested in people optimizing as individuals so that they have more capacity to actually do things that are meaningful because when people look at [[climate change]] and they look at [[species extinction]] and they look at refugee issues and etc they're like  __  i don't know what to do with that go back on facebook let's go back to work [3349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3349.52s)

list but fit and again back to education they're waiting for somebody to tell them what to do and do a good job at it as opposed to be able to self assess in a very complex scenario what might actually be effective because if anybody knew it'd be  __  happening right to self assess what needs to be done and then to actually start to initiate and and do that and self author so [3368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3368.21s)

individual optimization for that purpose is meaningful but it's interesting how the pursuit of happiness is core to the mission statement of our country right and the pursuit of happiness is a is an oxymoron it's a misnomer because when one is pursuing happiness they will definitely not be happy yeah you're inherently dissatisfied if you're seeking yeah they're affirming their [3391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3391.19s)

emptiness lack of happiness and they're in a fundamentally narcissistic pursuit and happiness occurs when you let the narcissism go and actually connect manfully to the world right and happiness is mostly this direction not this direction right mostly you know yeah and that also that also impacts another piece of the of addiction recovery is once one has enough [3411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3411.92s)

stability i mean kind of the whole point of this doing go help the next person that comes along that is struggling in ways in which you have and then that's that's where the magic happens right that's when the lights turn on when you make a difference right yeah and it's not just because now you're affirming the principles to yourself until you want to live them it's that but it's [3430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3430.91s)

also because now your life actually has a sense of meaning exactly where it doesn't need a hit from something else as much yeah exactly yeah and i think yeah i figured that out pretty early on into my recovery which was almost 21 years ago like the first time i was even just together enough to have a car and give some kid a ride you know and just be of service and that was [3451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3451.75s)

like god i was experiencing the helpers high and then even know it and now to have the ability to do that on a on a more broad scale of having a podcast and making these videos and talking to people like you and and and getting feedback although it's not you know a true connection but like a direct message or a facebook message like oh my god i've struggled with x y & z and i've [3471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3471.19s)

been listening to your shadow and now i'm getting over it i mean it's like well okay my life has meaning and purpose finally and not to say that being a plumber or working construction or working at a gas station or whatever wouldn't as well because you know there's people needed in all of these different areas but to do the thing that i really love to do it's been so [3490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3490.81s)

fulfilling and it directly helps people on a on a really deep level so god man that's funny i was just gonna like touch on like just sprinkle on a couple of things that we went into and yeah i have a feeling weird up i'm gonna have to be coming down a lot of fuel and if you'll have me because there's many conversations that need to need to happen but i definitely want to get into [3512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3512.17s)

you know neuro hacker collective what you guys are doing qualia just getting now that we sort of created a framework and a reason that someone would want to optimize themselves as other than just like coal now i can get more stuff for myself and be happier for myself but to actually you know be a piece of biology and consciousness that can go out into the world and have some discernment in [3537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3537.34s)

terms of what i want to put my energy into or not so how did neuro hacker collective come to be and what are you guys all about for those that are unfamiliar yeah so there's a few founders and they all had interesting different stories that kind of came together all i'll share mine here's so i was running a think-tank that was working on the types of issues were [3561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3561.88s)

talking about social issues how do we actually have civilization self organize well and so one of the things we know that's pretty easy you know this is that all the problems we want to solve our problems that are caused by human action whether we're looking at [[species extinction]] or [[climate change]] or female genital mutilation or war like this or human behavior mod [3580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3580.78s)

topics right and so how do we get how do we support humans to behave in ways that are good for themselves and good for the whole simultaneously without directly or indirectly custom harm so then it's the question is what are all the things that influence in behavior obviously we talked about economics if a particular action is incentive it's pretty hard to prevent it right so how do we create an [3601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3601.96s)

[[economic system]] where the whale is not worth more dead than it is live if we don't want to have any whales that's where topic right how do we create you know [[social system|social systems]] and tech influences our behavior our environment influence our behavior our psychology our worldview our definition of what is fundamentally meaningful does but our biology also influences our behavior and [3620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3620.35s)

everybody who has ever had a you know a pretty significant sickness or even just have their hormones out of balance or a hangover knows that your physiology can go into a state that affects your psychology and your cognitive capacity and disposition significantly where if your neurotransmitters are off or your hormones are off or etc in a particular way accessing gratitude or happiness or [3644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3644.8s)

hope it might be very very hard and staying out of anger frustration etc might be very hard and that's gonna affect behavioral not only their own suffering but also behavioral predispositions same with complex thinking i've actually got to be able to have a decent working memory to be able to hold multiple perspectives at once and synthesize them if i don't have [3667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3667.18s)

enough working memory to hold multiple perspectives at the same time i'll default into a simplistic perspective so right which is why i'm malnourished people are so easy to brainwash right that is a part of it and so the you know the thing we started looking at there is how does physiology affect human predisposition not just their own experience but how likely they are to [3692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3692.14s)

behave violently or behave charitably psychopathy empathy you know types of dynamics and also the ability to understand complex things the emotional resilience to hang in with in difficult times and understanding more about mind brain interface there is a bi-directional interface both influenced each other as we're looking at the way the brain and [3713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3713.23s)

the physiology affect the mind right the emotion and the cognitive dimensions we it's not just a genetic like oh you're you have a genetic predisposition for psychopathy therefore you're a psychopath typically the genetic predispositions for a psychiatric thing are our genes that do something like process a specific nutrient right like well we'll [3732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3732.88s)

look at psychiatric issues from genes that process the methylation of a b vitamin or the excretion of a mineral like copper and zinc or something and so if those nutrients are necessary for a specific type of brain function like empathy or impulse control and they're not being processed well then you might not be able to have impulse control and what with what we actually can do about [3754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3754.35s)

it is without changing your genome just actually say oh the gene that would code for the transform of this vitamin isn't happening we can just give the post transform version of the vitamin and that mental illness is actually better so this is the kind of field of integrative psychiatry psychopharmacology and i started seeing how many of the dynamics that address [3774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3774.67s)

the world have a physiologic component to them and started to look at could we up regulate the neural networks that mediate empathy that mediate impulse control to mediate emotional resilience that mediate complex thinking that mediate a sense of agency so the human bio hardware was not only predisposed to feel better but also predisposed to have increased capacity and behave in ways [3796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3796.42s)

that are fundamentally more you know pro-social which just does correspond with healthier - right it's interesting because we grow evolving in a social environment healthy people are pro-social right think about a psychopath in a tribe doesn't make it very well right they're gonna get killed or taken out of the tribe or they're gonna get better but they don't actually [3816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3816.04s)

get to be in a social deep social environment without pro-social behavior and work and so neural hackers started for me with a deep exploration into understanding how we can affect human physiology in ways that decreases suffering increases capacity positive disposition the first product we launched qualia was one of minion this next year a bunch of the additional [3838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3838.609s)

ones are coming out in very cool oh i'm excited and i want to get into the quality thing because people i get a lot of inquiries about it and i'm i'm so into it but well we'll go into that side a little of the framework but i definitely want to cover that cuz it's exciting so in a world where we have so much distraction from all of the things going off from [[social media]] and on the phone and etc with so much hyper competitive pressure to try and produce almost everyone has a pretty strong sense of pressure to want to be able to focus better and to be able to have more sustained attention and gets it done well having a pretty significant challenge doing that and not only the you know focus issues like from distraction but insufficient nutrients [3886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3886.64s)

that are necessary certain kinds of toxic exposure that affects the brain you know etc so so we see this ramp in energy drinks so more and more caffeine and in smart drug usage and and so with smart drugs in particular which in contra distinction to brain nutrients or things you would just get from a normal healthy diet but we probably don't get enough because of depleted topsoil and [3911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3911.42s)

whatever else right and those are just nutrients it in our [[evolutionary environment]] we're necessary for brain function no we also didn't try to do 12 hours of productive work that was cognitive per to him and evolution environments we're using nutrients differently so we might have increased nutrient need of obviously got radically decreased topsoil density interesting [3928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3928.88s)

right so going on and collecting acorns for a couple hours that they are hunting for rabbits or whatever it's quite different from sitting down and solving the complex problems that we are in this technological age so interesting you know deficiencies pretty rampant different kinds of toxicity like you know just volatile organic compounds in this paint and this carpet are you know [3951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3951.799s)

there's hundreds of vocs in the air that were breathing just normal stuff right little own industrial pollution in the atmosphere and glyphosate in agriculture whatever else and they're almost all either percentage neurotoxins or endocrine disruptors and like it's a significant issue so we've basically as as tool builders we've built a world that we're not adapted for [3973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3973.88s)

and so how do how do we deal with that we were looking at the cognitive issues one of the first ones or many we looked at you know issues related to anxiety and depression and pain and addiction and sleep and those are all things we'll talk about but you know we saw this meteoric rise of energy drinks so they're doing 15 billion dollars domestically pretty young you know 300 [3992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=3992.119s)

milligrams of caffeine at a time and god knows what else man anytime i see someone drinking one of those things i'm just like me cuz you every once a while the 7-eleven i'll just pick something up not like i'm gonna buy of it i just read the ingredients out of just morbid curiosity i'm like oh my god it's like so toxic man so you know the artificial flavors [4012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4012.759s)

sweeteners colors are not adding to brain health dude and in just the water you think when you go buy a drink is the water it's fluoridated tap water in most cases that's really the bulk of what you're getting when you buy a 12 ounce whatever drink you're drinking a bunch of tap water so you've you've got you know that kind of rise then you see with smart drugs obviously we have a lot of [4035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4035.289s)

people on prescription adderall wellbutrin by vans modafinil for psychiatric disorders for cognitive disorders and there's a pretty big question about what percentage of those actual prescription cases are good for people i'm stating that conservatively but then we have all the people on off-label right use which is not even prescribed they're just black market you [4059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4059.729s)

know universities midterm and final at all sales everywhere right and even well be trimmed up or know lots of different things and so estimate is something like 15 billion dollars a year also in off-label smart drug sales something like 5 billion in that role and they work right like they work for a very narrow set of metrics so if i want to focus get my midterm done or my tech [4086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4086.109s)

start up or whatever it is the dopaminergic dynamics from the adderall are gonna make me focus better and have more motivation and more drive now some of the interesting things that we find is because it's just modifying dopamine and not looking at acetylcholine and what how it's involved in memory not looking at glutamate not looking at all of the rest of neuro chemistry and not [4108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4108.02s)

even looking at all of the dopamine process just typically one small part that one synthetic molecules can override you get certain effects on certain side effects and certain missing effects right so we get increased focus but we don't get increased memory man she get decreased memory of certain kinds that all decrease creativity and then decreased empathy increased anxiety [4128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4128.63s)

aggressiveness sometimes depersonalization d realization decreased task switching you know etc these are really important thing so and because even insofar as we're affecting dopamine we're just overriding a regulatory system providing a whole bunch of an insane chemical not actually saying how does this system regulate its own dopamine and how can we support it [4152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4152.359s)

to do that then we're gonna create dependence and addiction and so these were the things that i saw was a scaling amount of dependence and addiction and very narrow positives with a lot of the positives that were necessary missing and meaningful side-effects so the question in that space we worked with people in a in an integrative medical clinical environment - when we had their [4172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4172.1s)

genomics we had their blood labs we had brain scans to customize chemistry that helped them tremendously so we knew we can do that and then question was can we do that at scale without personalization which i didn't know because personalization is a big deal and we're working towards methods to build a personalized there are some things that i just won't do widely cuz they have to [4191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4191.089s)

be personalized they're so different person-to-person so alright right we don't have any type of folate or folic acid because whether someone should be on a methylated or nonmetal label it makes such a really big difference there right we just don't  __  with that access if we can't personalize that yeah but there are a lot of axes that everyone who is self selecting into a [4208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4208.16s)

particular kind of thing like something for cognitive enhancement do pretty well across the whole board so you know high success and well tolerated so what we wanted to do with quality was say can we make an alternative so that people don't have to go to just a tremendous amount caffeine or off-label smart drugs or just suffer without the ability to focus they will actually help them in what [4229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4229.96s)

they're looking for with enough subjective effect that they actually feel it and that will actually have a much wider host of positive effects that we're getting focusing concentration and drive but also emotional resilience and task switching and creativity and analysis and synthesis and you know so we we started by doing a a kind of cognitive map of [4250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4250.66s)

what are all of the states and all of the capacities that people are looking for when they were they wanting to do productive work and then saying what are the underlying physiologic pathways that mediate those that we know about from the various neuro scientific and bioscience fields and then can we understand how those systems work so how does the body regulate dopamine so you [4273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4273.16s)

know as you start to look at you say alright so protein comes in dietarily gets broken down to amino acids phenylalanine converts into tyrosine converts to n acetyl tyrosine converts to l-dopa crosses the blood-brain barrier converts to dopamine and a presynaptic neuron transport a protein down an axon crosses a synapse has to get by synaptic enzymes that will break [4292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4292.54s)

it down in different ways hydroxylase and they may ob and cmt and etc and then goes into one of a few dopamine receptors there's inter cellular dynamics that are involved so you just start to look at that and say how does the body do this thing on its own and are there deficiencies in any of those key nutrients or transform factors or things [4310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4310.719s)

that are oftentimes under fully supported that we can support and that would be just looking at dopamine right then you do that with acetylcholine when you look at glutamate then you look at functions like neurogenesis but is continuously developing new neurons are there things that actually support increased neurogenesis or neuro etaf that gee killing old neurons better so [4331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4331.51s)

you don't have senescence so we looked at what are the host of things people are looking for there are healthy states and capacities what is the underlying physiology involved how does that physiology naturally regulate and what what what might we be able to do to support the natural regulatory systems so that people both have a more complete positive state and that rather than [4353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4353.199s)

create dependence right there on it for a while overrode their regulatory system and now there's addiction that it actually is supporting the robustness of the regulatory system so that when they get off it there is elevation from baseline that lasts right the exact opposite side effect in the exact opposite of [4370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4370.749s)

dependence so that was our goal and so we did hundreds of iterations bunch of testing you know after doing full litter to review database of five hundred no tropic chemicals and looking at the pathways of them and then looking at positive synergies negative synergies delivery mechanisms and we ended up getting to this formula you know that's there right now which [4391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4391.03s)

over a large enough number of people over a large enough amount of time tested well enough that we were actually really happy with it and so that's that first product and that the goal there was to be able to support people having increased productive capacity rate increased cognitive clarity and the associated emotional states like resilience and and drive that was [4412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4412.9s)

actually not bad for people and good for people now i can't claim that we know that because we haven't done long enough term trials with enough metrics with enough controls to claim all that but you know we've done preclinical trials with pre and post brain scans and biometrics and seen you know really meaningful statistical correlations and we've had i don't forty thousand people [4437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4437.26s)

over three years we're collecting data from what their experience is really so we we're very happy about that and that's the first car that didn't you know what it kind of is is a complex approach because her brain is a [[complex system]] embodies a [[complex system]] so rather than here's one molecule to override it it's how does it self-regulate and can we support it [4460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4460.389s)

self-regulation across many related axes now if we were gonna approach anxiety we would do it the same way if we were gonna approach pain rather than you know just some end set or opiate we do it the same way how does the body naturally produce its own opiates how does it naturally deal with inflammation and can we support those dynamics if we're gonna work with sleep we go to the [4482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4482.19s)

same way so those are things i like i can't wait to see what you guys are coming up with next so there's a couple of things in there that i really like is that you guys really were very thoughtful about the synergy between the different compounds i think there's a lot of cowboys and indians right now in the nootropic spaces i'm sure you're aware where you see the same kind of [4504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4504.239s)

formulations on 10 different products and it's like one guy just looked at what the next guys doing on a label oh yeah here that's good for short-term memory focus cognition whatever blah blah and they just kind of throw those stacks out there without necessarily for thought as to how those interact with one another right so you have one molecule and it does one thing and let's [4524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4524.07s)

just even say that that that effect of that molecule is universal and you're choosing ones that are kind of universally affecting people in the same way but then you combine that with other molecules another one's another ones and now you have something totally different you have a third party compound now right and so that can go well or not based on self experimentation there's [4543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4543.57s)

been times where i've you know taken too many different things at the same time and too much of them and i'm having the opposite effect where i can't focus and i'm actually feel like i'm freaking nuts because i took too many smart drugs or whatever i overdosed on yohimbe wants for example just random like don't do that kids at home you know pay attention to the the dosage and stuff but i think [4565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4565.8s)

what's cool about qualia is that you really looked at how things relate to one another that you're not putting anything in there that's gonna cause your body to down regulate its own production we're to the point where there's a dependency and oh my god now i can't make this neurotransmitter or whatever because i've it's been done for me for so long [4584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4584.61s)

and then also i did the whole basis of it is coming from what i like about the company itself is that it's coming from this intention that we're trying to create people with biology that runs better so they'll be better people i mean to me that makes total sense i had to flew a couple of months ago and i was in colorado and i had to speak at two events and they were pretty substantial [4607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4607.53s)

for me and i was so and i didn't i could not make myself be in a good mood like i literally just couldn't be happy you know it's just i was just depressed and even though my mind was right and i wasn't fighting it i wasn't like caught in some sort of negative spiral i wasn't actually negative at all it just wasn't in a good mood that it's well happy like i do [4629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4629.63s)

right now so i wasn't firing on all cylinders you know so i really think that you do have to approach your own development from all sides in other words i can't be eating you know glyphosate and aspartame and all this evil things that they put in food and just think i can meditate my way into a higher consciousness while i'm destroying my biology in the same [4651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4651.92s)

way i can't become obsessed with herbs and superfoods and your tropics and then be running around flipping people off in traffic caught in my trauma issues you know it's like you have to kind of approach it from all angles so i like that you're not like hey guys let's make a cool vitamin that makes people better at computer work it's like now we have a larger scope of vision which is really [4670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4670.76s)

cool now back to the qualia it's been interesting to observe the friends that i've turned on to it and you know listeners of the show and stuff like that is that i haven't i've yet to have anyone say that they had a negative experience as a result where with a lot of other nootropics people say that it's too stimulating or it made them tired made them like this made them like that [4695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4695.63s)

so i've had no one report back like oh my god i felt horrible and only a couple people that were like man i don't really notice anything yeah so the majority of people that i've interacted with that have tried are like oh my god this is the best thing ever like what where has this been my whole life like an overwhelmingly positive experience and that's what it's been like for me too [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4718.1s)

which is one of the reasons i wanted to track you down and i found out there was so much more to your story than just being like you know a guy that knows about nootropics but for me what's been interesting speaking of especially the the down-regulation piece is that when i started i took the full dose i think it was three of number one and six of [4737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4737.24s)

number two and i did that a lot and it kind of just brought me up to a nice base level and then at a certain point that became a little to stimulating and now i'm like i take one number one to number two and i'm like i feel great there's no need to even push it beyond that so it actually has the opposite effect of building up a tolerance a right that was intended yeah [4759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4759.059s)

so good job on that because with most other things you take it and you take it in you build the tolerance you need more and more and then your body forgets how to make it and you end up in this imbalance but i think that there's just something really cool about what you've done i'm gonna come back to the problems of capitalism for a minute yeah every mba student learns one of the first [4778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4778.739s)

principles of businesses maximize lifetime revenue of a customer so you guys are blowing it cuz now i'm like i need to i was on auto-ship of quality because i was pounding so much of it and now i'm like actually i'm getting too many shipments i had to stop that and just order when i run out cuz i'm gonna run out it's so you guys aren't your business model is going against that [4797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4797.519s)

theory so it going so you think about it from say i'm a pharma company and there are mbas that are looking at the financial instruments and making decisions right i mean at the financial metrics and spreadsheets and and saying okay maximize lifetime revenue of a customer the things that treat symptoms forever so we say depression is not curable you have a biochemical imbalance [4823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4823.4s)

which is like some magic term biochemical miles with a bucket cause of it right genetic it's just just a magic term for we don't know where we haven't bothered to look at it and in depth and so we have to simply treat that forever heart disease automatically treat that forever cholesterol we're gonna treat it  __  all right so that's very good from a lifetime revenue point of view [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4844.439s)

and if it creates side effects did need other drugs to resolve them that's called a cross seller and a perfect and then if to maximize lifetime value i want to start them as young as possible so we make up new diseases like a td after we put two ritalin shitty desks and so they still make those desks like they have my seventies this little wooden prisons so we get them started as [4870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4870.51s)

early as possible on an iatrogenic cycle right so pretty much everything that in medicine we wanted to do the opposite if it causes addiction we want to create a long-term benefit because the side effects you want the side effects to be comprehensively positive if the people have to stay on it we want them to get off of it right that like that's the goal and so really theory of market should not apply to medicine because people really can't choose to not participate with something that will make them better if they're sick and since they really can't choose not to do that theory of markets as a  __  up thing just like there shouldn't be for-profit prisons right and so this was hard for us because and is why we started with [4907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4907.75s)

supplement as opposed to bigger things we could have done is because i didn't want to take capital from any financial service places that would then bind us to doing things were unethical so like our right our cost of goods to make qualia is more expensive than most metroplex retail and it's because if you want to use the right form right you use the phosphorylated version of this and [4928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4928.3s)

the methylated version of this and etc and with the right concentration of the dose you knows you take nine  __  capsules yeah but and that's not filler it's because it just takes that much of those things it's just expensive no and also the fact that you guys aren't using excipient sand binders and all that weird stuff which i always notice right away i'm like i go to the end of the [4945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4945.22s)

label and a suddenly i got that there it is which means that you can't work with almost any manufacturers because that's what they need to make it work in their machine it's a magnesium stearate and and all this stuff right yeah so all all of that like doing the integrity thing is just a hard thing to make work fiscally but like you have found with your podcast if you do there will be [4964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4964.57s)

people that are attracted to that thing and it can grow so that's what we're trying to do that's cool yeah the real deal so in terms of the other things that people typically use i want to just run run a couple of these by you because i take my qualia i guess about five days a week and as i said it's been strange that my dosage has gone down it must be fixing me that's the way i look at it [4990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=4990.13s)

like it's it's connecting synapses or something that were off and other they're getting more in alignment so what i look at it but there's other things to that depending on where i'm going what i'm doing i find to be useful so today for example i knew that i was gonna have a very social day i'm going to be talking to you i'm being interview the way back home after this so i did a [5009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5009.15s)

number of different things one of them being phenibut for example which i'll maybe do once a week or something like that and i just find it's just a really great social lubricant and then i also took some piracetam because i find that it really helps me with speech so some of these other things i'll do but i could give joe here piracetam and it'll give him anxiety or he won't notice [5037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5037.199s)

anything or i give someone else i gave a girlfriend once phenibut and she probably took a little bit too much but she got deathly ill you know andand what i would take for this it's like a sprinkle to me to her she was a bit smaller and just had this huge adverse reaction same thing i modafinil is another one that i really like and for me i take an eighth a dose of modafinil [5059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5059.28s)

for me is an eighth of one tablet right so it's like a 200 milligram tablet once i took a half i was like oh my god i feel like i'm on crystal meth not fun a quarter if i'm really really tired set me straight but if i just want to have a productive day and be relatively alert just a tiny tiny little piece which is about an eighth of a tablet does me i've given it to friends [5082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5082.32s)

i'd say man be careful this is a this is a drug this is not an herb like go easy they take a half like i didn't feel anything they take another half they're like man i didn't notice anything like oh my god if i took a whole modafinil i would be like you know scrubbing the freaking bathroom floor with the toothbrush i mean i would be tweaking so hard so what's up with some of those [5102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5102.84s)

there you mentioned deborah i was on like low dose deborah no for a while and i have tried a lot of different things outside of the safe and more plant-based stuff that you guys work with in qualia what are some of the other ones or even microdosing on psilocybin like that whole other world of smart drugs and nootropics what do you got to say about any of that sure okay so let's let's make some categories here so we've got the smart drugs as a category which are pharmaceuticals that are usually being used for an off-label purpose they're oftentimes psych meds like wellbutrin or adderall or they are narcolepsy meds like modafinil or they are sometimes anti parkinson's meds deborah now yeah right i remember i was taking that stuff someone's like what is it i just no big deal it's for parkinson's i'm just microdosing it now all of those are dopaminergic right so for different purposes they don't manage jigs you'll have some like for alzheimer's don't have to sell that work with this is that all those urges mean they raised over me okay no wonder i [5177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5177.56s)

like all of those yes so you've got you know various types of smart drugs is one category most of the time those are gonna have a pretty strong effect and a pretty decent chance of side-effect if used improperly there's really nothing that is gonna be all that dangerous if used properly but properly is the big thing right like whether we're talking i mean you can use heroin not dangerously [5204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5204.47s)

if you if you use it properly but that's like not how people use use heroin and specifically adderall is amphetamine right it's a dm feta mean you add a methyl group to it you have methamphetamine methamphetamine used to be a pharmaceutical and so like the distinction between pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs is where the legal categorization of the minute happens to [5231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5231.5s)

be based on lobbying now based on much else so you've got smart drugs as a category and in general people should explore there if they are well educated it's like if they really educate themselves well about the topic and they and they're really paying attention in a quantified self kind of way to the results and they should not be looking at doing that super regularly now there [5255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5255.2s)

are exceptions so debra know for instance works through mao-b inhibition so mao-b is a enzyme in this apps that breaks down certain neurotransmitters like dopamine like other catecholamines like phenyl fo me so if you inhibit the mao-b those neurotransmitters will get across the sentence more into the postsynaptic [5277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5277.87s)

neuron this can be very dangerous because if you take that with anything that is also increasing mono aunt means going those types of neurotransmitters going into the synapse specifically ones it should be broken down by mao-b they can get to to high level so one wants to be careful with that and so what would be some things that you with debra know for example that you wouldn't want to [5300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5300.91s)

combine with that at all interesting and that doesn't mean nobody does it and has a good experience what about my daffodil same right so if if you are now they're different modafinil we don't know all the mechanisms of modafinil that well it is the least symptomatic dopaminergic for the most part for most people it seems like it works through transporter proteins [5326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5326.05s)

largely which is gonna be a little bit less tricky than many of the other mechanisms but if if you are flooding the synapse with dopamine and not breaking it down you can get to dangerously high levels right and not everyone has too high mao beat genetically some people's mao-b is too low they actually feel anxious because they have too many of those [5349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5349.59s)

excitatory neurotransmitters and never know what makes them feel terrible but there are a lot of people who are genetically / producers of mao-b and they will have certain kinds of depression tendencies because their transmitters are just not getting across the synapse that well and if they take something that's just increasing the level of dopamine they might feel better [5372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5372.13s)

but it's actually not doing the right part of the mechanism right in the right part of the pathway what's going on for them if they actually break down the excessive levels of mao be that they're genetically producing and there's other things that can cause a male bee to go up other than just genetics it's inducible and so as people age mao-b goes up dopamine goes down it's a part [5389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5389.68s)

of aging which is why debra knows one of the few drugs it is actually correlated to be a life extension agent and there are people who in their young wouldn't do well with it when they're older they would because there may o be levels one from a healthy place where it would imbalance them to being excessive and no balances them so deborah no can actually be [5407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5407.32s)

therapeutic for some people for other people it'll be an enhancement that they shouldn't do regularly so to the degree you're getting into stronger tools you should have more education just like in any field right like playing with the skill soft rather than the handsaw you kind of need to learn a little bit more because there's more the consequence but you can also do cooler stuff with it [5425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5425.05s)

so for us empowered responsibilities and self education is a really key thing because we want people to be empowered in their own health and not just feel like a victim and waiting for someone to tell them what to do who has no way of knowing what their own experiences are spending enough time even if it's a well-educated doctor they wear their fiscal structure only allows them has [5445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5445.479s)

been five minutes of time like they just can't apply what they write that well right so smart drugs is one category research chemicals is another category well you have a bunch of chemicals that are not actually categorized as a drug they're also not categorized as a nutraceutical they are for research purposes only and they live in that kind of regulatory bardo and that's most of [5465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5465.789s)

the know tropics they like the rasa tam's and women the rasa temps are in that category and the ampa keens those are the kind of two primary categories that people get into but then also the nsi 189 the p21 the cerebral ice and the lots of the phenibut right they live in that research chemical category and some of those are basically smart drugs that just didn't go through approval but and [5491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5491.709s)

then some of them are more what we call a formal no tropic which is something that can increase cognitive some aspect of cognitive performance without meaningful side effect most mark drugs will have some side effect unless it happens to be one that's therapeutic for you so and then we've also got brain nutrients which are just the amino acids fatty acids vitamins minerals that the [5514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5514.51s)

brain needs to function well that are often deficient and then you've got the tentacles and you know plants that modulate different things in different botanicals can be very powerful right you can you can get l-dopa from mucuna which is a parkinson's man in different dos right it's not the same kind of dos but you can get very potent botanicals so all those categories of [5535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5535.7s)

things to play with and of course as people really get into biohacking and they're all hacking and become well-educated you've got different delivery mechanisms people do them so cute aeneas or i am or iv or snort stuff intranasal or you know whatever right so there's a big interesting field and some of them can also be not just cognitive enhancing for the normal [5556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5556.46s)

well-being but very therapeutic if someone is dealing with post they're dealing with a post tbi situation something that is neurogenic that enhances development of new neurons after they had some micro brain damage can be very helpful there's a whole lot to learn so one of the things we're working on is really competent education and you know community space so that [5577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5577.94s)

people can learn as well right now it's forums on reddit and you know places like that where people can really have to sort at the end yes good or not yeah it's it's funny now too with the algorithms online search results are very skewed oftentimes like i was looking for something a couple days ago that was some good political news a little bit conspiratorial i think i was [5600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5600.14s)

researching the number of times cnn has been busted for lying and producing fake news and i googled like how much how many times the cnn been caught doing fake news in 2007 something like that and i phrased it a few different ways and nothing came up you know you can't find an article if you use google to find that for example and it's the same way when you start looking for some of [5622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5622.76s)

this stuff you'll read something on a forum and you're like okay this guy says this about modafinil or phenibut or whatever and then literally you get to the next ten sites and it's the same exact copy know that some other schmo has like copy and pasted into his blog or some other forum you're like wait they're all getting the same you know five talking points from the same place [5643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5643.07s)

so even if you are a good researcher sometimes it's hard to come up with original valid data just because it doesn't exist you know like you said with some of these things that are in that gray zone in terms of their categorization it's it's sometimes it's difficult to even educate yourself because you don't know what's true false classic but we had a we had a you know scenario where people had questions about central phenoxy safe and because even on some very good no tropic sites it says central phenoxy mike hot burst damage birth defects and because and trophy rocks and converts a dmae is a which is a cholinergic coating donor and there were some studies that showed dmae causing birth defects and [5687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5687.8s)

rats now people do their research to say well you should avoid that you know in that scenario now it's i should get into it if we get out of if we really look at the rat studies and we say what kind of dosage to what administration is it relevant to normal dosage know the it's nothing in a normal oral dosage range was there at all it was it was even close dma he actually became approved as [5713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5713.51s)

a drug without that being a concern in many different countries and then central phenix seen never had any birth defects studies and so yet that's all over the web central don't do it because of birth thank you right now we pulled every single study ever done on central moccasin that we can 586 studies most of which weren't online we had to go to medical libraries find them in other [5735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5735.23s)

countries and other languages right because they they were started the research further than the fifty so they just would never put online translate them all and then we had a few phds in neural chemistry neuroanatomy etc do a structured literature review meta-analysis of all that for us to come up talk with our opinion on central you know there's not [5753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5753.8s)

a trivial thing to do but it matters if you really don't know what's going on so i like the wild west of the space because people are starting to take more responsibility rather than just with the doctor tell them what to do and they get mad at the doctor when it doesn't work yeah when the doctor couldn't possibly spend enough time with them or keep up-to-date with all the research [5773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5773.48s)

happening but i really do long for higher quality control and it's one of the things we're working on and we can only work on as fast as we can afford without moving into fiscal models that suck which is the the tricky part but like neuro tech you know we were talking about different devices that we have around the house in pmf and etc it's pretty easy to say this seems [5793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5793.68s)

compelling let's share it well what we're working to do right now is with all the types of neuro tech whether we're talking about low-level laser therapy and transcranial intranasal lasers or we're talking about pmf or tms or you know whatever right for us it's a process of doing the full letter to review on everything that's known about this where who what things does it [5815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5815.29s)

affect what things does it not affect safe etcetera and then doing full research on the actual products and say does this product have the specifications that the literature shows are useful and then curate those things so we're building a platform to do that it's just a non-trivial process and the same with just curating knowledge on nootropics is in the forum you've got [5836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5836.34s)

like some real gems and then a bunch of  __  and it's not gonna say obvious which ones are the gems in the  __  same like if you look in the bodybuilder world you go to the steroid forums some of the smartest endocrinologist anywhere are in there and then there's just so much done bro science um it's like but if you don't know the field well they're all same  __  you don't know right so [5855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5855.34s)

this is something that we're really working to do is to have a moderation process where everything that goes there is better now that's cool man that's cool that's that's a really valuable resource because i that's excite you know another positive thing about right now is that i think more people are waking up to the fact that they don't actually have to rely on the allopathic [5874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5874.87s)

medical system like i have episodes and i call them things like learning to become your own doctor you know it's like you really can do a lot on your own and then if you're if you are tied into someone good and functional medicine and they're able to kind of you know be a step above you in terms of their body and knowledge but like with my relationship to medicine is i do a lot [5896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5896.71s)

of my own research and footwork and order my own labs and geek out in like which labs are the best and most updated because even my functional medicine doctor they're still in the labs that were the best gi test last year i'm like no man and the biohacking community there's new labs with you know new parameters and things like that and i really feel the sense of power and [5916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5916.69s)

autonomy because i'm you know i know my limitations in terms of my body of knowledge and what i may have been capable of understanding or care to take the time to learn when it comes to my biology but i know what i know and then i go to the experts that are higher of the food chain and in their area of special specialization right so it's really cool [5935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5935.31s)

that that you guys are thinking that far ahead and enabling people to help themselves one of the parts i'm most excited about is a integrative medical functional medical program so we've got a number of doctors who are kind of the best integrative psychiatrists that i'm aware of yeah well psychiatrists or just [5957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5957.28s)

functional medicine that does second or pharmacology and so you know we're not allowed to provide medical information prescribe diagnose treat anything like that right so if people and if someone is on has psych conditions or on psych meds you don't use our stuff because there's there's real interactions that need to be factored but we don't want to just say go to your doctor if your [5982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=5982.66s)

doctor doesn't know anything we want to provide better resources so go to your doctor and here are doctors that actually know that field really well they can run a qejy on you they can run neural hormones they can run your walsh metabolic labs they can run your gut brain access they can look at your genomics etc and actually do the the best of what functional brain chemistry [6001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6001.56s)

optimization currently looks like and so that's something that we'll be rolling out in this next year and then we've been already working with another that's amazing that's amazing yeah because you do need that that middleman you know you're just a freakin genius and you have the time and energy to devote to yourself but i think each one of us can only take it to a certain [6025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6025.11s)

level and we need you know we need that help but it's like how do you find a good one i always get the question of who's the best functional medicine doctor and i'm just i just made it easy on myself after working with a number of them individually and i just joined parsley health which is like a you know sort of i think of it as the uber of functional medicine just a a modern [6044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6044.01s)

interface and a membership model rather than paying per visit and and i find it to be really effective because they can deal with my insurance in the billing and they know how to code the labs and stuff but it's still very much self-directed like i could just follow their program probably be healthy but i'm always digging deeper so i'll do you [6060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6060.42s)

know three different tests for metals where they might just order me the pre and post challenged your intestine like oh that gives me a certain metric but just hair analysis there's blood there's other ways you can dive into that but it's helpful to have someone you trust that'll go along with what you're doing he's back in the western medicine model i go into the general practitioner and [6081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6081.78s)

be like hey i have x y & z wrong they send me out to a number of specialists that are their cronies and it's like you get stuck in that whole thing and i'm going in there telling them about some new supplement or technology and the doctors like what i don't even know about that you know like i was having some problems with like vertigo and dizziness and i you know went up the the [6100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6100.92s)

ladder in la medical system which i think is probably a pretty good place to live if you want some you know high-level medical care and i got sent to did you know the world's best emt that people travel from all over the world i go sit down with this guy said yeah man i don't know man i have you know i have a little hearing loss over here that's about 20% i'm well aware of [6119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6119.55s)

that but i have this thing where i'm getting dizzy all the time and i always feel carsick and he ran some tests for me i came in again he goes yeah i think you probably should just not drink coffee i think it's the the caffeine can do that like really this is what you guys this the best you guys can do is that the caffeine is making me you know it was just like oh my god [6139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6139.53s)

i could have done a much better job of being my own doctor and of course i you know finding finding the root of that but it's a cool time to be alive where those of us that are waking up and have access to information like you guys are providing can really take responsibility well no and not become this dependent infant on the teat of western medicine and all the inherent expenses and things [6161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6161.46s)

that come along with that and it's really important to keep the pareto principle in mind which is it does get complex quickly and to be able to synthesize that complexity is a really deep topic and the foundations are still 80% of it and the foundations are not that hard right i mean they might be hard to do from a discipline point of view in the life that is [6184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6184.26s)

conditioned otherwise but if someone is not sleeping enough sleeping well and sleeping enough everything else they'll do is just tiny diminishing returns in comparison and sleeping enough right right and if someone is not exercising and if they're not generally eating well and if they're not doing some kinds of stress management and mental processes then the [6206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6206.58s)

you know biohacking is actually a way to support living shittily right trying to like symptom manage the fact that their life actually sucks right and that's just not the way to go right and so if someone really just does the foundational stuff it's amazing how much of it that addresses and even like i say we look at heavy metals so i can do a pre and post provocation test and i can [6234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6234.03s)

test with the mps or dms a or edta and i'm gonna get different specific findings and i can look at hair labs which will give me a different time scale of what's being excreted and i can look at you know metal antibody stands nd and then what i'm gonna find is okay there are specific chelation or binders that i'm going to use differentially if it's lead versus mercury right or [6258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6258.81s)

gadolinium or whatever it is that's a lot to figure out it's a lot of expense and if i just put the person in a sauna every day and i gave them chlorella in the morning that would be 80% as good right yeah and so it's just kind of important like one of the things we want people to know is that there are foundational things that if they don't have the time money proclivity will [6284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6284.58s)

really help them be radically healthier and and then optimization on top of that it's nice right right yeah that's that's well stated sometimes they'll find myself taking a 50 pills in the morning trying to turn my brain on and then i realized maybe if i hadn't gone to bed at 2:00 a.m. and woken up at 7:30 you know so that's that's very true some of those things [6308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6308.55s)

are just basic lifestyle choices if you eat if you think about it if you're gonna eat food in its measured in pounds and it's all nutrients right that's all stalks in our nutrient and then you're gonna take supplements that are measured in grey the supplement the word supplement means to supplement that what you're getting from right-right like getting the pounds [6327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6327.71s)

right is a big  __  deal right and similarly was sleep like when you exercise all that torn muscle that it needs repair is gonna be repairing during sleep during delta's they can particular and all those nutrients that need to go into new tissues are gonna do that during sleep and so if you're not sleeping enough like all the other stuff just kind of doesn't matter that much [6348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6348.2s)

and so this is one of the places where i want to empower people in the face of the complexity to know that there is a simplicity that is most of it which is if you live a life that is relatively closer to an [[evolutionary environment]] in evolutionary life you'll just do a lot better and then all the other stuff if you're sick you definitely want to go find good functional practitioners and [6372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6372.65s)

if you really want to optimize you want to go yeah well said well said i love it man well i've got about one not even a quarter through the questions that i have in mind for you but in the interest of time we're right around the two-hour mark which is i try to cap any conversation off and no matter how much more there is to do but i have my notes [6395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6395.75s)

for part two i'd love to uh sit down and have another talk with you i mean every time every like every time you have an answer to a question twenty more questions populated just like a stifling more that have come about so we're definitely gonna have to talk again but i really appreciate your perspective i was again this is fun and yeah it's just fascinating dude you just you're you're [6420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6420.86s)

so full of information i mean you really are just the fascinating guy was all pumping people up on the instagram on the way don't have like this guy's really smart you guys you know you know i'm not stroking her ego it's just you are it's the thing that you and i were talking about is that people are are actually fascinated by life without being broken right right and they can [6438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6438.62s)

restore that if they were broken and if you just spend your life following things that you're fascinated about you will tend to learn things right i want to know what's up next with neuro hacker collected you mentioned the functional medicine kind of interfacing can you reveal yet what your next supplement or product is going to be we've got we've got about ten products [6462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6462.34s)

that have already tested well in the prototype phase of different types that we'll be going through you know final refinement and trials like that before being released where up she actually hiring right now for additional formulators and vp of product and etc and researchers to come help because as we're scaling it needs more work to be able to do it as at the speed we want to [6489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6489.56s)

so things - we will not produce any product that is to treat any medical condition can't mom do that right that's a medical thing but things that support sleep things that support healthy sensory process meaning if there are sources of chronic pain that chronic pain is not loving people things that help support i'm looking forward to that one things that help support natural [6519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6519.41s)

calmness which is not saying that anxiety thing what is it yeah i think our audience is able to read between the lines all of those i i find that i dance around terminology so much on this show in the interest of protecting my guests that happen to produce a different product or service movement so those are things that will be coming soon we have a new version of qualia also that is [6543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6543.65s)

just a single step less total pills oh wow and right now is testing as effectively so we spend a year refining early this next year so even a handful of new products in the nutraceutical mind brain health space then curating neuro tech across those platforms i mean all types of neuro tech with a proper scientific reading creation platform and then the doctor program are the things [6570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6570.77s)

that i'm really excited so when you say neuro tract tech are you talking about lasers and light devices and magnetism and all this kind of stuff oh cool that's interesting what are some you know zyv those of you listening that aren't seeing the video as i walked into daniels home here it's a beautiful of its jack kantak house a lot of big rooms it's [6591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6591.02s)

lovely but in every everywhere i look i see some biohacking tool or something there's big amethyst crystals everywhere there's a tsamina bed right in front of me and a bulletproof sleep induction mat and earth pulse essential oils in the air i mean it's like it's just so in alignment with my lifestyle what are some of the neuro enhancing or just life enhancing technologies that you're [6614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6614.21s)

digging right now personally mm-hmm some of the ones that i appreciate a lot that are like consumer neuro tech they're not still in rd i i'm a big fan like everybody else's of red light and so companies like juve and buy light and other ones they yakking on intranasal trans clay transcranial whole-body near infrared and visible infrared and we wouldn't need that if we just been a fan [6649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6649.85s)

of sun right but if you don't spend enough time in the sun it is removed from normal indoor lighting because it's the part that makes it expensive it yeah it uses that more energy to make warm light right so rather than do the whole house you just do your body with your clothes off and right now it'd be you know we photosynthesize molecules like plants do not as many as plants plants [6671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6671.12s)

or all surface area of photosynthesis were not that much surface area but we it's a meaningful part so we know that the blue water and uv into the spectrum helps us with vitamin d and the way that it does vitamin d synthesis is different than all really supplementing vitamin d so there's meaningfulness there but nitric oxide is also photo synthesized from exposure to light and atp [6691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6691.55s)

specifically is up regulated mitochondria output of atp is up regulated from the red end of the spectrum and so up regulating atp output is kind of just good for everything right this generates increased cellular energy to do whatever the cells are doing so that's a that's what i like and i do like transcranial and intranasal applications especially where there is [6713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6713.06s)

tbi or tinnitus or things there where you don't quite know how to address it specifically but you know interesting because i do the nay the v-lite the 810 nanometers near-infrared it's invisible right i used that when i used to have the one that was six something it was very read it lit up the whole front of her face which i just like that for a fact i [6734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6734.63s)

don't know which one does what and then i do the jus and i love both of those as well like seriously i mean but here's the thing i also get a lot of sun my vitamin d levels are off the chart i still supplement with it here's one thing that i wanted to get your opinion and i always say okay it's the end of the interview and that it goes on for another hour but in all seriousness with [6755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6755.119s)

the spectrum of light because i i do sungazing have been doing that for years grounding all on the sun gazing when the sun rises or goes down i get full naked sun as much as possible so i'm getting a lot of the natural spectrums i limit blue light at night like pretty hardcore in the home when it gets dark outside it also gets amber and red inside like i'm dialing that in my sleeps great [6778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6778.219s)

circadian rhythm but when it comes to the spectrums of sunlight you know different people might have different opinions on this but based on being a 47 year old guy and knowing what the sky looks like normally with planes in it or planes not in it there is unequivocally some geoengineering going on on the planet and i think anyone that doesn't acknowledge that to some degree like has [6800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6800.8s)

serious psychological issues having you know looked up in the sky and not seen weird clouds and the formations and stuff we have now there's definitely something going on which is of course a different conversation but with with the weather manipulation of what's being going on in the sky i often wonder because it does have a parent lee something to do with reflecting the [6820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6820.699s)

sun's you know radiation back out into space to pull the planet wherever the  __  going on but the the temperature of the light and the spectrum of light is being altered in an unnatural way from whatever's being done in our skies do you think that that's having you know an effect on our biology just aside from whatever toxins might we might be breathing in with just the actual nature [6841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6841.73s)

of light itself of course very short answer to a long question so geoengineering is an approach to us recognizing that we're very close to positive feedback loops on certain [[climate change]] dynamics and people freak out and write a freakout says well we need to actually get the temperature down because even before the acid is killing the coral from ocean [6871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6871.02s)

acidification from co2 diffusing into the water as carbonic acid even before the trophic cascades are killing the coral from the large fish dying off from overfishing the temperature is the main thing driving them into bleaching and hypometabolism they can't stay in that place very long most of the photosynthesis of the world happens in the oceans and a lot of it depends on [6890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6890.309s)

the coral so how do we get the and and the positive feedback loop on that on the albedo cycle at the caps like so it's like whoa we need to get temperature down so the idea of let's just reflect 20% in sunlight by putting particles never atmosphere that will reflect 20% sunlight is the same exact approach as our cholesterol high use a statin mmm it is right it's addressing [6913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6913.679s)

the symptom in a way that will then have effects that are negative for other parts of it because we're scared of the symptom without understanding what caused it and addressing it at a college level so of course what we should be focused on is how do we just increase photosynthesis for sequesteration and decrease emissions and what has to happen to be able to do that at what [6937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6937.139s)

scale in time but yeah well it's very interesting allopathic medicine is looking at individual metrics that we've correlated to something and how do we exogenously override that individual metric without looking at what brought it about to be that way and so complex multifactorial dynamics we suck out which is why we don't have a single cure for any chronic illness we can cut [6960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6960.96s)

cancers out radiate amount poison out we can't make them stop growing and understand why they grow in terms of current medicine same with psych psychiatric illnesses same with neuro degenerative same with autoimmune because they don't have a single college we're actually awesome at acute cause issues right right right if it's an acute injury or an acute [6980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6980.309s)

infection or an acute toxicity that's really straightforward and we know how to treat that thing but if it is anything other than a cute single cause then we kind of suck at it right now because it requires a different approach to science of this complexity approach which also requires a different fiscal model and a different ip structure and a whole bunch of things [6999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=6999.55s)

we approach the world the same way our approach to [[climate change]] to starvation to whatever is to tweak something to affect that thing here without addressing the underlying bang so geoengineering is like allopathic medicine is that into the environment yeah that's that's funnier and and definitely it's affecting the light going back to like your you know your [7022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7022.769s)

top devices a lot of the stuff that's coming out now they think that's really effective is ways to sort of use technology to mimic nature in a sense and that's how i think about an infrared sauna or cryotherapy i mean any of the things that i do is quote unquote bio hacks are grounding you know using earthing technology pmf all this stuff it's all really just trying to create [7041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7041.189s)

that homeostatic experience of being the sentient being on planet earth in its natural state but we're not in a natural state including the light spectrum that's coming in at us from the sun like you can't even get what you would have gotten a hundred years ago true our main bio hacks are actually just putting us back in something closer to an [[evolutionary environment]] so our air filter right it's not making special air it's just making right i saw that you have one over there too yeah and our water filters are also still not as good as spring water right do you have a pristine hydro filter you don't have a purse okay they're there in laguna beach you know not far from here but i've done a lot of research on the filters and i'm gonna interview that guy but i think if [7087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7087.869s)

i had to have a filter he'd probably be the guy he vortexes the water he puts magnesium bicarbonate silica back in it i mean he's like he's like making spring water out of municipal water it's crazy but anyway but you know whether we're changing our weather we're pulling toxins out of the environment or like you know it's mentioning the boc here actually it's not releasing much because [7108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7108.359s)

i used the afm safe coat okay and safe coats another i think is awesome if you have a place that's new carpet new paint or you're going to paint or install things the non-toxic products that if it makes a religion no away cool that is going in the show notes but yeah i mean so much of it is just recreating [[evolutionary environment|evolutionary environments]] there's like so many people who are ill go like move to or visit some more rural natural place and think you better right and so that's a lot of it and then there's a course advance shed that is not just doing that yeah what are the weather kind of tricks you got up your sleeve that i haven't been observed walking by tech tech wise well qejy based neurofeedback is awesome mmm and whether you're doing alpha-theta [7155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7155.84s)

training or smr training or delta training should be based off your qejy and someone knows how knows how to do that well i don't know if you've ever went to peak brain since you look i go there all the time yeah but andrews good yeah andrew is good i interviewed him here on the show and i was on his show - yeah brilliant guy so that's a great therapy right now [7177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7177.349s)

i mean tms is actually interesting it's it's early but it's interesting for many things well it's tms transcranial magnetic stimulation is profoundly interesting in the early studies at university of arizona and some japanese universities in curing alzheimer's i'm through their novel proposed mechanism involving microtubules so but it's too early to [7199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7199.46s)

really know what it's doing so there's a number of high-tech methods that are really cool and specifically there's also but some of the most high-tech ones are are actually still evolutionary merriman ones like the cutting edge of microbial mix is mostly that the vaginal flora and the breast milk of indigenous people who were never exposed to chlorinated water and [7225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7225.17s)

antibiotics and glyphosate have a whole bunch of bacteria that we just don't have in probiotics anywhere else that are actually part of our evolutionary virus ignition for epigenetic modulation or genome so that's a very cutting edge right understanding about the genetics and microbiome acts right and it is also saying oh evolution actually kind of makes sense okay or fecal implants from [7249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7249.46s)

clean you know they're clean source so to speak so we have a chunk of which in like robotics were working on right now there oh i'm we're not that close yet cuz that's what we want to do but i'm excited about it cool awesome man okay so yeah i will say obviously we didn't get into psychedelics and entheogens no i have a whole section on that yeah and we didn't get into any of the [7278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7278.95s)

psycho-emotional psycho-spiritual worker all right but on the jist [[evolutionary environment]] i will make a thought and closing is just like a statin is optimizing for one thing right lower your cholesterol without looking at hey is the cholesterol maybe protecting the arterial system from oxidative damage and that's not a good idea or what's the whole rest of the story going on when we [7299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7299.47s)

optimize for something that is affecting a lot of other things we're not paying attention we get externality rate which is also a cold side effect we built the entire world the human built world for a few purposes and ways that affected a lot of other things so we build a house to protect us from the elements and give us a you know a safe place to be and then maybe for a certain aspects of [7324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7324.489s)

aesthetics but we didn't pay attention to oh well there's actually chemistry that's in the paint that is affecting us and oh you have the fungicides that are in there that are making fungicide resistant funguses that are why we have an issue with mold we never did before oh that that actually it's important thing like in the drywall paints out in the paint in the 70s started having [7346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7346.03s)

fungicides added resist mold and then the mold became super mrsa mold oh god that's so the reason everyone has mold issues when we lived with mold forever we're in an environment that's because this is me anymore oh my god so but even suns like you know the color and angle right all of these end up affecting the the psyche this field of environmental cycling right if you're in an if you're [7370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7370.58s)

in an area where there's graffiti and trash on the ground and the walls this kind of environmental psych studies been done many times if if you just paint over the graffiti and clean up the trash violent crime drops like thirty to fifty percent wow and it's because you think about what the environments transmitting from your there is one this is a wasteland [7389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7389.96s)

and i'm in survival mode and to this is a place where law doesn't operate mmm-hmm right cuz yeah a bit broken and they're not right rectified right and right as soon as you fix those things how violent human beings are is being changed at the like fifty percent level by an environmental psych right i've heard david hawkins talk about that he called it the broken window theory you [7413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7413.0s)

know you have the building in the ghetto and it gets ignored and then someone breaks the window and then someone comes along breaks another window then comes the graffiti then the drug dealers on the corner and everett i never thought about the kind of mechanics of it that's very interesting it's i guess the it's like the level of consciousness of anything could you say would you frame [7430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7430.84s)

it in that way i would say that's a way of reducing the complexity of it right um which is kind of my thing i interview people like you and go to squish that down into a bite-sized thought but i mean so if you go into a cathedral they're doing environmental psych and so the sound and the smell and the visual and every aspect of the sensory process is designed to uplift and exulting but [7459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7459.89s)

then specifically that it's narrow and very high has a certain effect that's different than if it was wide and high or if it was not high right which is you're very focused on up and so then you feel very small and you can both have a sense of feeling you know and then the priest is halfway between you and where jesus is up there right and where god is [7482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7482.33s)

and so both if you want to look at the cynical side of the this is how you make a good authority rien dynamic where everybody feels small an authority up there but also the beautiful the mystical side of people feeling a sense of all an exaltation right the environmental psychology of how those buildings are done induced state right just like burning man [7500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7500.23s)

induces state because of the environment even if you don't period so what we are realizing is that we have built a world that we are not well adapted to all right and it's affecting us in a lot of ways that we didn't pay attention to that are mostly not good for us and so there is this task that you and it's not good for the planet right and it's not good for us so there's this task of how [7522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7522.4s)

do we rebuild the entire physical built world in a way where the goal the primary goal is not in you know it being an expensive or fast or aesthetically beautiful those are all partial goals the primary goal is that it is enlightening the humans that are inhabiting it how do you create a built world that makes the healthiest most enlightened most pro-social human beings [7545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7545.679s)

that are inhabiting it and how do we rebuild the entire world of that in mind in in relationship to you know harmony with the ecosystem so that's the biohack that is most interesting to me that's amazing dude i love that really good way to sum it up alright so closing question who have been three teachers or teachings that have influenced your work where we might be able to go find more [7569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7569.619s)

from them like who have you learned from that we might go up and learn from as well specifically more related to individual health or just anything anything totally broad could be a book teacher philosophy relative i'm preferably something that one could go look up or we can put in the show notes you know  __  meister fuller whatever you know but mr. fuller would definitely [7595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7595.119s)

be at the top of the list and either operating manual for spaceship earth or critical path being the most approachable books on understanding state of the world and how to think and how to design so that would be very high on the list and then i ordering three is impossible for me so i'm sorry the ones that came to mind first yeah yeah that's the idea finite and infinite games by james cars' is a great book that is it's a book that will help you understand both the future of economics the future of worldview and very deep spiritual principles together from a [[game theory|game theoretic]] perspective and it's a small easy read wow cool is a great one and then the next one came to mind was anthony de mello who's actually a jesuit priest but was someone who [7650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7650.26s)

studied all the world religions and traditions and spent most his time in india a little book called the way to love and tiny little book and principles of sovereignty what does it mean to actually be whole and to be able to love from a place of wholeness rather than this commodities exchange we usually call love of what do i have to give someone to get the security and [7676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7676.12s)

reassurance and validation i'm looking for and how will i punish them if they don't do what i want but because there there is really no such thing as being able to really love someone which means to see them and want for them if you need them to be something because you can't see them if you need them to be something else right and you can't walk for them if what's in their highest good [7695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWihHrj6zs&t=7695.2s)
