music we're fast approaching the age of the superhuman and we're doing this by transcending the bounds of evolution so buckle up and prepare to enter the world of the iron man executive with dr daniel strickland we'll explore the limitless human potential through cutting-edge science new technologies and medical advancement here is your host [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=20.72s)

dr daniel stickler welcome back to this edition of the iron man executive i'm dr dan and as usual we have another really exciting and educational show coming up for you i do want to reiterate a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about about all the exciting things that have been happening [40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=40.399s)

at the appearance center for human potential where we have recently launched the appearon academy that's a p e i r o n dot academy not a dot com but dot academy you can go there check out all the new courses that we're teaching now in epigenetics we're actually having a [58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=58.719s)

certification in epigenetic coaching this is about 120 hours of training and most of that is done by me i also have some really amazing coaches that are going to be teaching this with me coaches that are tops in their field in the realm of coaching tops in their field in the realm of business development for health coaches [82](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=82.96s)

health and wellness so if you are an existing health and wellness coach a physician a chiropractor a nutritional therapist a dietitian or somebody who just wants to get into health coaching because you have a huge passion for it go on and check this out because this will take you to a whole new level epigenetic coaching is the new paradigm [105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=105.92s)

of medicine and after you hear the intro on that website you will be convinced plus we have a lot of fun in creating this tribe so be sure to check it out now you heard me talk last week about a essentially an affiliate partnership that we have developed with neurohacker collective this is a company [127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=127.28s)

that manufactures the the neurohacker qualia brain supplementation and i tell you the stuff is really out of this world i mean it it truly does exactly what you expect it to do and it really is just taking the brain to a whole new level of optimization we found this [146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=146.72s)

after i had referred several patients to it to try it out because it really had a mix of nutrients that i said you know this is really the real deal and so it led down the road to several conversations with the company and eventually um i had some conversations with daniel schmokenberger who is one of the [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=167.76s)

founders and the guy is absolutely fascinating so i asked him to come on the podcast and to talk about the whole neurohacker collective and a little bit about the qualia product and he agreed to do so this is an interview that is really out of this world i mean daniel i i don't even venture to [186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=186.48s)

give a good intro to daniel because any anything i try to do as far as a bio will really not do justice to who daniel schmoktenberger is so what i did is i asked him to kind of tell us about himself and about the company and their mission in the intro to this interview and i can tell you he is someone who [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=212.48s)

takes an entire systems approach to absolutely everything you know in our medical practice we use a systems approach to health and wellness and it's this whole interaction of all these systems involved well he takes that to a whole new level of not only health and wellness but to business to commerce to life [230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=230.56s)

in general and you're going to be blown away by this interview so sit back and have a listen all right so i've got a great guest with us today his name is daniel schmochtenberger and he has agreed to come on and talk to us about various topics but most importantly we want to focus on the company that is part of his [255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=255.76s)

vision and some of the products that they have but let's start off uh daniel talking about who you are just give us some background and a little bit about what makes you you hmm very open question so i think a meaningful place to start is i was fortunate to be home educated as a kid [277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=277.44s)

in a way that was kind of a an educational experiment that my parents wanted to run which was uh what happens if you give a kid no curriculum at all expose them to everything you can see what they're interested in and facilitate the interests so i didn't have a fixed amount of [295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=295.44s)

social studies and english and etc and what was really interesting about that of course it means that there are certain things that are part of normal general education that i wasn't interested in and just didn't get so my my handwriting is illegible my spelling is bad but uh but i go very deeply into all the sciences early on [317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=317.36s)

and i didn't even think of them as separate divisions because the division between biology and chemistry and physics are useful for us for trying to create curriculum but obviously universe is radically integrated and you have causal arrows pointing in uh up and down directions and so studying it that way it was just the study of how universe works and so all the areas of science all of the philosophic disciplines that created context for maybe why is science that way why is the nature of reality the way that it is and then all the different areas of activism how can we [351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=351.039s)

understand the nature of reality better so we can participate in alleviating suffering making a higher quality of life experience possible for everyone so that braid of activism science and philosophy is kind of core to who i am and all of the various endeavors fit within it yeah and that's why i wanted to bring [370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=370.8s)

that up because looking at your background i mean you have a very diverse kind of entrepreneurial background and activism background can you tell us about some of the projects that they came from that yeah so working in activism early on this was everything from ecological work to uh civil rights work to animal rights work and one of the things that i saw also having a background in interdisciplinary science ended up leading fortunately to a background in system science understanding how seemingly different things actually fit together into self-organizing holes into [405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=405.44s)

whole systems and so taking a system science approach to activism i saw okay here's an area where we're trying to say protect an animal from poaching and the answer is say it was an elephant we're gonna put bigger fences around the preserves and create harsher sentencing for poachers [423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=423.44s)

but we're not addressing the underlying poverty of the people that can't meet their needs any other way adequately other than poaching we're not addressing the [[value system]] and why it's conditioned that way towards animals not addressing macroeconomics that leads to poverty we're not addressed like there's so many things [439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=439.919s)

that aren't being addressed that if we succeed at getting the fences up then the poachers move to some other animal somewhere else or you know some other problem and so starting to look at what would it take to actually meaningfully address all of the things that need addressed from a system's point of view what would a whole [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=455.84s)

system's design upgrade for humanity look like so relatively early on that became my primary inquiry and so this was maybe we actually can't change the future of education to be optimal education that brings forth the uh the full potential and capability of humans if we don't change macroeconomics [474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=474.72s)

to where we're not having to prepare those kids for a workforce in the way that we are now but we're preparing them for a different macroeconomic structure where the facilitation of their unique genius capabilities is you know is supported in terms of the system they're coming into et cetera right so start looking at what is the [491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=491.599s)

future of macroeconomics what's the future of governance what's the future of education of healthcare that are optimum factoring the interconnectivity of all of those things upgrading so this was the beginning of starting a think tank that then worked with a number of other leading edge think tanks on the topic of [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=508.56s)

fundamental restructure of civilization in ways that could prevent current problems that really must be prevented catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] that otherwise have too high of a probability currently that could address the underlying causes of so much of the unnecessary human induced suffering and [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=526.8s)

that could produce highest quality of life for the highest potential quality of life for all life and so then it's just really been a refinement of this process of what really needs to happen and how do we go about doing that and for a while i worked with [543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=543.44s)

large ngos and companies and trying to implement some of the ideas through there through those vehicles until realizing that those vehicles really couldn't do the things that were necessary the groups that were working on hunger were quite happy to address starvation in areas of [562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=562.08s)

extreme poverty by bringing industrial agriculture to the area to be able to create more food production there even if that meant more nitrogen runoff leading to faster [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean because those weren't the metrics they were tasked with and it doesn't mean they were really [579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=579.279s)

happy it just means that the nature of here's the metrics you're tasked with and they are they are inter connected with other things but that's not they're the focus of how that interconnectivity is addressed is just outside of the macro systems that uh you know those structures are part of and so eventually said all right well let's just actually [598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=598.399s)

look at how to build things from scratch that can obsolete the things that need obsoleted well that's uh you know there's a reason behind why i wanted you to go into that story i i've we've talked previously and and i know the story and i've read some background on it but it's also one of the approaches we [615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=615.44s)

use in our new paradigm of medicine of human potential medicine where we look at this entire biospherical approach so we look at the interactions of all aspects of the human being including environmental interactions and sleep stress thoughts brain function all of that so you've taken this into just this amazing [637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=637.6s)

think take process and here's here's what i'm leading to is the the creation of neurohacker collective that neurohacker collective actually came from this this think tank and i think that's just fascinating the way that the the organization i think a lot of people will look at neurohacker [658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=658.48s)

and they'll see the quality of product and they'll think oh they're a supplement company but that's far from even close to what neurohacker collective is two things one is you said the approach that we're describing for civilization design and the approach that you advocate for medicine are very related they are very related [676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=676.48s)

because the human body and the human mind body environment system is a [[complex system]] and so if you try and do you know reductionist parts based approach it just it works for acute things it doesn't work for complex things and so all right there is too much ldl [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=695.2s)

so we're going to give a statin but we didn't really ask why there's too much ldl and what the externalities side effects of the statin are going to be and you know that approach just doesn't work for complex illness and it doesn't work for comprehensive wellness optimization so you have to say across all of the different body systems [713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=713.279s)

are there ways that the gut affects the brain yes through the entire [[nervous system]] through uh the microbiota through you know so the division between neurology and gastroenterology we just can't you can't maintain specialism across those boundaries you can't maintain specialism across the genetic bottom-up organization and [734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=734.24s)

the connectomic top-down organization because they're influencing each other in real time and so you look at the body as a whole complex adaptive system regulatory system and then you say our goal is to increase the resilience of the entire system the homeostatic capacity of the whole system how do we go about doing that and to see [755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=755.12s)

disease as where some deviations from homeostasis exceeded the homeostatic capacity of the system leading to pathophysiology and how do we then bring that back and you know restore system resilience when we're looking at an ecosystem or we're looking at human civilization systems they're also [774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=774.48s)

complex adaptive systems where the goal similarly the economics and the environment are inter-affecting each other inexorably right the all the [[social system|social systems]] governance law or inter-affecting infrastructure and so you have to say well again what would a really resilient system look like and it's not going to look like [[exponential growth]] of a [[materials economy]] on a finite planet there's just no way that could ever be resilient right it's not going to look like for-profit a military-industrial complex while trying to create peace or for-profit sick care while trying to create health was not going to look like places where [814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=814.399s)

the incentives are misaligned with the goals and so you say well what would a really resilient system look like and so very like why humanitarian aid why all of our approaches to peace and security and global problem solving haven't been working is the exact same reason allopathic medicine doesn't work for complex issues [833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=833.279s)

is i mean we very much have an allopathic system of governance that is dealing with symptoms rather than causes dealing with things as separate issues that really are interconnected issues so you know we apply the same systems for looking at medicine in the body because they are [[complex system|complex systems]] optimization now why we started focusing on bringing forward solutions for future of well-being science which would include what we've called medicine in the past how to move from disease states to wellness states but also how to maintain and optimize and continuously evolve states of higher and [870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=870.72s)

higher well-being higher and higher system resilience and we're starting not in the medicine space but in the optimization space with neural hypercollective and specifically in the mind brain space how do we optimize the mind brain interface for optimally sovereign humans humans whose agency whose intelligence [888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=888.0s)

whose sentience are all you know evolving and interconnectedly evolving the reason why that is one of the critical things that has to happen for all of the meaningful shifts that have to happen on the planet-wide level is that when we look at all of the problems that we want to change whether we're talking [906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=906.079s)

about violence you know at a crime level or violence at a war level or violence against nature at a [[biodiversity loss]] level or like all of those issues that we're trying to address are caused by human behavior and all of the solutions we want to bring about have to come from human behavior [923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=923.36s)

so then the question becomes what are all the things that influence human behavior and that can influence it in destructive or constructive directions and obviously economics influences human behavior if if you create an [[economic system]] where war is profitable or an [[economic system]] where a whale is worth a million dollars dead on a fishing boat but is worth nothing alive that [[economic system]] predisposes destructive behavior so you need to change economics to incentivize for any agent that which is also positive for all other agents in the commons that is a radically different system of macroeconomics so economics and [[social system|social systems]] as a whole influence behavior environment influences behavior our psychology and our definition of success and self-influence behavior so does our physiology and everyone who has ever felt shitty when they were sick or had a hangover or hormones or neurotransmitters were [980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=980.32s)

out of balance or just had a headache knows that there are certain states of consciousness that are just unaccessible when your physiology is off and other ones that are almost unavoidable that affect your experience and your behavior and the same is true when your system is more in tune and so realizing that [996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=996.0s)

empathy runs on certain neural networks in the brain that consciousness is running on the hardware of physiology and if the hardware physiology is damaged or just down regulated or out of tune that there are whole aspects of of experience and behavior that are just either down regulated or not possible in the question of how do we optimize [1017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1017.92s)

physiology for optimal human experience and behavior right people who have complex problem solving have high emotional resilience have high you know agency etc so that they have the predispositions and capability to really be assets to the balance sheet of nature rather than liability yeah and [1040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1040.4s)

you know the this whole complex interactive aspect i mean you you focused in on allopathic medicine but i see it in functional medicine as well i mean i think the the whole system has come down to treating the human being as a diseased state there isn't this this option for optimization in the [1058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1058.96s)

medical communities right now and you know that's our driving force is to create that that option for people who say you know what we're not really broken and how can we how can we optimize this system to take us to a new level of existence a new level of functioning not in a hedonistic way but in a in a kind of eu demonic way to bring the the [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1083.36s)

whole population into this into this new realm um josh metaldorf a friend of mine who i interviewed on the on this show is he wrote the book cracking the aging code and he compared the current medical paradigm to you know hearing the call of a man overboard and you run and you see a guy [1103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1103.28s)

thrashing in the water and you're throwing life preservers to him and he's not reaching for them and you can keep throwing them but he's never going to reach for them because it's a it's a system that's that's broken that you can't fix no matter how hard you try so i think you know there is a role for that [1120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1120.32s)

disease model aspect but you know we're with the advances we have i mean this is something that we need this new approach to and you know you've you've ventured into this realm with the neurohacker collective the the qualia product that you have created with that is just [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1139.76s)

an amazing product to optimize uh human function yeah so we talk about the future of well-being science more than we talk about the future of medicine because medicine is the system of uh how do we deal with illness and of course once illness is there our well-being science system already [1160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1160.16s)

failed our goal is to maintain and optimize and evolve well-being and then of course there there will be times where something happens right there's some deviation from homeostasis that's beyond the system's capacity and so we come in to help bring you know help resolve it but the goal is recognizing that it's actually [1179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1179.2s)

the system's own self-organization that is what makes the person better it's just now what things do we help supply the system with so it can do that so coming to uh jumping forward and if if it's interesting to get into how we define health and well-being how we define illness how we define aging [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1198.96s)

we can do that in pretty formal ways that are useful so we can come back to that okay the goal qualia specifically was it's the first product that we brought to the market as a kind of well-being enhancement support and specifically well-being enhancement in the direction of increasing quality [1216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1216.0s)

of [[subjective experience]] and certain aspects of performance capability that are aligned with what people would traditionally think of associated with cognitive enhancement but take it a step up we think of what we call sovereignty enhancement we define sovereignty in a bigger way than i think most people are used to thinking of it [1234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1234.159s)

we define sovereignty as the product of three orthonormal vectors x y z axis so one of them is intelligence one is sentience one is agency so intelligence is one's ability to process all kinds of information so critical thinking and systemic thinking and total body of knowledge and memory focus information [1258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1258.64s)

uh speed of processing is all things associated with intelligence sentience is one's depth and subtlety and robustness of uh feeling right of sensing of experiencing so empathy and mindfulness and awareness of self and other you know all those things live in sentience and then agency is one's [1281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1281.6s)

ability to maintain their integrity as an individual and then act in the universe and act in the universe functionally so will drive responsibility follow through all those things so if you think of those three as x y z axes and you think of kind of whichever the shortest one is defines volume of a sphere we're trying to grow that sphere and uh [1302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1302.32s)

so when you think of the fact that you know and you know very well someone's certain hormones being out of balance certain neurotransmitters certain cell energy dynamics being out of balance can absolutely affect people's will and drive can affect their empathy their proprioception their mindfulness can affect their [1320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1320.0s)

cognition you know various aspects of it so addressing the physiology of it is not sufficient we also have to address the psychology of it and the you know what we kind of think of as the human software side but the human hardware side is necessary and so we're saying what can we do to support the underlying aspects of human [1337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1337.36s)

physiology that are involved in all of those to optimize uh and involve human sovereignty so quality is the first thing we brought to market to support those processes and you know it was several years of r d where we were doing personalized versions of that in clinical settings i'm sure similar to [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1355.44s)

how you do and then realizing that when we're looking at when we were looking at complex you know blood chemistry genomes etc there were some things that were very different from one person to the next and how to bring that kind of personalized well-being science to masses [1373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1373.6s)

is in our uh goal set but there were many things that were common across most people that were key to systems optimization and those were the early products were able to start uh developing well the thing that really impressed me about this i mean you know we're we do epigenetics and we do nutrigenomics in our practice [1391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1391.6s)

and you know this is basically a bottle full of uh of nutrigenomic modifiers i had looked into developing a powder that included some of this stuff but what excited me was when i'm reading through this i mean you you you had taken what was the concept in my mind and taken it to [1412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1412.4s)

just a whole new level with with what you put in this stuff and it was not only a combination of product but the actual dosages which you rarely see in supplements at dosage levels that are equivalent to what the research is actually showing i mean when i saw acetyl l-carnitine at 800 milligrams algal dha [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1432.08s)

at 200 milligrams even bacopa monaria which is one of my favorite supplements at 300 milligrams ben fatia mean mucuna to help boost dopamine in the brain all of these things were just really impressive for me to to see that even adding the the uridine to the supplement in order to help with the choline utilization [1457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1457.12s)

boost choline i mean you just don't see that in supplements and it was exciting to see this and when i started recommending it to my clients and i hadn't even taken it yet they were reporting back to me how outstanding they felt on this stuff i have to say there's one thing though that i would love to see in it and it's holy basil which uh if i could [1478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1478.559s)

say there's one thing that would make this thing just perfect it would be holy basil the process of how we developed it was actually really fun i think you'll appreciate so we started from a kind of cognitive science point of view of saying all right so what are all of these subjective states and capabilities cognitive and [1496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1496.88s)

you know other neurologically related capabilities that we're wanting to affect for people here and that people are wanting when they go to say energy drinks or off-label smart drugs or uh whatever and so we we modeled that out it has to do with short-term memory and speed of memory and long-term memory [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1515.279s)

and verbal fluency and digit span and arithmetic processing and analytic thinking and synthetic thinking and creativity and focus and attention span you know all of those cognitive metrics and things like drive and emotional resilience with increased presence and subjective flow state and so [1537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1537.2s)

it's very important to get that right first because if you have just a subset of it you're seeking to optimize a subset of that it'll usually be at the cost of some of the other important metrics so this is what's so commonly reported when someone is using a smart drug like adderall for off-label purposes they'll increase [1551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1551.919s)

a part of their dopamine pathway without the rest of the aspects of their dopamine pathway or any of the other neurotransmitter or other you know kind of key neurologic pathways such that they do have increased say focus but maybe at the cost of other important cognitive metrics like aspects of memory and processing and definitely at the cost of [1571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1571.52s)

you know say the ability for task switching which can lead to more aggravation irritability anxiety and then of course you also have the ability to i mean if you use a exogenous override of an endogenous regulatory system then you're going to decrease the regulatory capacity of that system i.e dependence down regulation and addiction [1593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1593.12s)

and so our goal was how do we work through the endogenous pathways such that if someone used this for some period of time and then stopped rather than be down regulated and addicted they would actually have their baseline elevated and so we're really supporting you know endogenous regulatory capacity so we started with modeling [1612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1612.08s)

all right here's all the things we're wanting to affect subjectively performatively then we went through all the literature of all the various sciences that we could and said what do we know across all the sciences of which aspects of physiology mediate and relate to those aspects of psychology and so you know if we're talking about memory there's asp you know there's a lot that we know about acetylcholine about glutamate about catecholamines about specific receptor sites about specific kinds of synaptic processes so we started modeling all of that out to develop the whole interconnected set of [1648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1648.48s)

underlying physiology that we'd want to be up regulating and then the whole regulatory pathways associated to say we're wanting to up regulate these biosystems right and obviously that's going to get all the way to the whole system but in a weighted fashion and then we looked at what chemistries mapped to being able to support those [1669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1669.919s)

systems and we got a list of 500 or so chemicals that we had a lot of data on and then we started looking at which ones are safe across the other systems you know have good safety data which ones have synergistic effects across multiple systems and then we paired it down to that particular 42 [1688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1688.88s)

ingredients and those specific doses and the doses for some things seem high compared to other supplements sometimes they seem lower than someone would want but it's it's on purpose because say you're looking at the macuna for the l-dopa well we've got dlpa so you've got the phenylalanine which will be converting into tyrosine [1710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1710.799s)

and then acetyl tyrosine and then l-dopa and then dopamine so if you look at the fact that we've got the phenylalanine and acetyl tyrosine and l-dopa and the you know p5p that's part of the conversion process and some of the other minerals and vitamins are part of the conversion process and then things that [1726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1726.88s)

are going to support synaptic transporter proteins endogenous mao b inhibitors things that will sensitize d1 d2 receptors you can't use the same dose of each of those things that were effective in isolation when you start having synergies across the whole pathway so we started really [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1744.08s)

looking at how do we have you know the effective doses for optimizing flow through pathways and then interaction between pathways like dopamine with the rest of catecholamines with acetylcholine and glutamate with the underlying cell energy processes and and then deeper things like neurogenesis and synaptogenesis with regard to holy basil holy basil is [1763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1763.039s)

a beautiful herb obviously adaptogenically especially for ubiquitous adrenal stress you'll notice that we have the phosphatidylserine which has many of the similar effects in terms of hpa adaptogenic effects on you know serotonin acth et cetera we actually found enough people that did not respond well [1785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1785.12s)

to holy basil that it didn't make it in the were the kinds of people that were looking for the effects primarily that we'd have here that it didn't make it in this final cut but it was definitely used in many of the versions and we will have products coming out that will include it yeah one of the the the aspect i like about holy basil [1802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1802.88s)

is that the neuroplasticity and the bdnf increases that you get with the holy basil and that's that's that's been my finding with it in clinical practice as well i mean it's anecdotal but the cool thing about it is it raises it causes increased expression of fndc5 in the muscle which goes to the liver and gets converted to irisin which [1825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1825.919s)

goes to the brain and boosts bdnf which is the main purpose that we typically focus in on with the with the holy basil but i love this this whole approach that you have with looking at enhancing existing systems without supplanting the system and i think that's that's where [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1845.679s)

a lot of medicine has gone awry is that in medicine we focus and even in in wellness in general i mean we focus on trying to supplant the body's a beautiful system the body is an amazingly [[complex system]] that for us to even have the concept that we can micromanage it is is just mind-blowing and [1865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1865.039s)

so even with with like all these antioxidants that people take i mean come on we're we're producing uh what one times 10 to the 24th free radicals a day and you think that taking vitamin c and these high doses is going to make that big of a difference in that system is just ludicrous i mean you look at it and you say well it's not that the [1885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1885.12s)

system's broken it's not the free radicals are bad i mean we produce free radicals for a good reason so what we need to do is boost the body's management capabilities of that so boost the system that actually handles it give it that that little kick to say hey i'm going to keep you in a healthy state so that you can do this rather than me [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1903.36s)

trying to micromanage it and i love the way you've done that with this product yeah so there you know if you say how do we can giving glutathione have benefit for people totally does boosting endogenous glutathione production have more benefit obviously then is there an excessive need on glutathione as a whole because of you know some [1920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1920.0s)

increased toxic exposure or something that we could address or or you know chronic subclinical pathogens so we can do things to help of course so it's it is a very deep and nuanced thing i think the thing that i like you know i really love hearing you say is the the respect and reverence for the [1937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1937.36s)

intelligence of the body and nature and universe rather than it's it's a dumb system and so we have to fix it you know when you mention 10 to the 24th free radicals per day and what is what do we really think it means to manage that when we think about a trillion metabolic functions per second per cell give or take right and and the synchrony of all those right there is just radical parallel processing happening every cell having its own internal processing dynamics that then are interacting and not just every cell but every organelle all the way down to you know the fundamental physics of it and so there is no way to top down [1972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1972.48s)

manage that in fact we can mathematically prove it right we can prove that it is a that it is an np complete issue that is non-computable so then we say well how do we support those endogenous regulatory systems and that is a very different approach to well-being science you're listening to the iron man [1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=1992.72s)

executive with dr daniel stukler be sure to check out the ironman executive.com website for free offers bonus materials and extended interviews now back to the ironman executive show well i want to shift gears a little bit because i wanted to get to this during this interview but talking about most of my listeners are major biohackers uh they're all about [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2017.039s)

you know trying different things uh the n equals one approach and i don't actually prefer that term biohacking i i prefer optimizing human potential in in that regard uh biohacking just seems almost in that hedonic realm but um you guys use the the term neurohacking and where do you see this this neurohacking going i mean what's the what's the future process of neurohacking that you see so just two quick little philosophic things you mentioned a couple times uh that the goal of future medicine is not purely hedonic or the future of optimization that old split between haydon and daemon is actually one of the nonsense things we have to dichotomies we have to reconcile so when we talked about optimizing human experience and human capability having a underlying philosophic model that shows that the way that people contribute to the whole is actually optimal for their own quality of life experience and as their quality of life goes up it increases their capacity and predisposition to contribute to the whole very much in the same way that a cell relates to the whole body right the way that human relates to humanity and to [2093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2093.119s)

universe and so we would not throw out hedonism we would include and transcend it right and i think when you said eudemonia that's a good word for include and transcend that people's own experience their experiential tone being optimized is absolutely useful for then optimizing their capability and [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2112.64s)

predisposition for serving meaningfully and vice versa without deep meaningful service their qualities of personal [[subjective experience]] that just don't happen and so i just i just wanted to mention that real quick the interview i did just uh just two weeks ago with steve cole who is a psychoneuroimmunologist at ucla [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2135.48s)

he did a study on hedonism versus eudemonic well-being and it blew me away they went into the study him and barbara friedrichson went into the study thinking you know they're going to see similar outcomes of positive physiological responses and they found that the on the psychological scales the hedonics [2158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2158.64s)

and the eudemonics scored equally well on well-being scores but then when they looked at the health of the immune system they started looking deeper into these epigenetic marks and and blood biomarkers and they found this this is just amazing the hedonic well-being group actually scored lower than people that had [2182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2182.48s)

low well-being to begin with while the eudemonic groups scored off the chart and in the health of their immune system and yet they appeared the same on psychological tests of well-being what that means is that the decreased immunity is going to lead to decreased psychological scores over time right right and so some of the team at [2202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2202.0s)

neural hacker wrote a really brilliant paper on this i think it's going to publish soon but um if one is pursuing states of experience that through processes that create momentary spikes but end up eroding baseline then of course you can have elevated state on the short term and eroded baseline long term [2223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2223.2s)

if you are pursuing states of experience where you actually want to evolve the baseline itself then it's a totally different approach and this is the two marshmallow experiment right we all we all know this but it is very meaningful to say it is actually anti-addictive what it ends up creating the highest quality of life which you [2242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2242.16s)

could say would be smart hedonism if someone wants to really have highest quality of experience that gets higher over time then it's not about short-term spikes it's about the evolution of baseline and the evolution of baseline means what actually builds the integrity of the system enduringly i'm kind of confused on that one can you [2259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2259.52s)

explain that one just a little bit more time somebody goes for the chocolate cake they feel good in the moment they feel shitty over time as they eat a lot of chocolate cake because they got a dopamine spike but they got a dopamine spike in a way that affected the rest of their physiology such that it's going to lead to an [2276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2276.48s)

imbalance in their dopamine opioid axis and a bunch of other systems so then of course as they feel shittier than they crave more dopamine spikes because their baseline is lower right their baseline well-being is lower which then wants to feel better more quickly and as it wants to feel better quickly than [2293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2293.119s)

it's going to go for whether it was the chocolate cake the cocaine or the whatever it is that creates a hit and so we can think of addiction as an eroding base you know some process to increase subjective well-being quickly that actually decreases the integrity of the system that lowers the baseline it creates more desperation to then feel [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2311.52s)

better which leads to doing the same process you know i got you yeah so you're you were referring to the the short-term aspects of it and and how that responds yeah i agree someone even pursuing hedonism intelligently which says i actually want to feel good but i want to feel [2329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2329.839s)

continuously good and progressively more so over a long period of time a fundamentally different approach has to be taken i still think that's going to come down to though you know like they they've found i mean in psychological well-being scores the people who pursued hedonism on a regular basis they scored very well on that psychological well-being just as [2349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2349.2s)

well as the ones that were you know living life with a purpose per se but you know i i just i think that there is there is some aspects that we're all going to experience that hedonistic approach but i think if we have that overriding purpose that vision of where where we want things to be and [2369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2369.2s)

and we're living towards i mean just you know one of the examples that dr cole used was you know the person who climbs mount everest i mean sure you can look at that as potentially a hedonistic aspect but if they're doing it to show humanity that that it can be done then that's a whole different psychological aspect to their well-being [2388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2388.16s)

that they're utilizing there okay the dichotomy that i'm speaking to that is worth reconciling is there is an old puritan distinction where pleasure is a bad thing and particular interpretation and so really we're seeking pleasure in the afterlife or something right sacrifice is a good thing [2411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2411.2s)

and purpose and meaning end up not being associated with pleasure and that distinction is an obsolete one right we can say that the highest kinds of the pleasure that are very real because like you said you have some psychological scores from people who are pursuing who are focused on their own state [2431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2431.76s)

versus focused on some larger things that include their own state and the key is focused on larger purposes but that will end up including their state rather than excluding it and so as people pursue being of you use to larger than themselves that will end up inexorably leading to them feeling [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2451.76s)

better and as to the degree that people actually feel better they will have more resources to show up more so we would just like i would like to have people think about advancing their own subjective quality of life and advancing their utility to the whole as being inner symbiotic with each other [2469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2469.359s)

i completely agree with that i think that uh that kind of brings it all together there and uh and makes a lot of sense to me you know my goal is to get to the point where we can reverse age and it's not a and obviously it does have a hedonistic component to it but in in a sense it's more about an [2487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2487.68s)

over overriding uh for me to be helping to create this new paradigm and to advance humanity in that regard because i see it as possible and people will look at it and say you know it's hedonistic to want to live forever well no not necessarily i can see that in that and what you just used as the [2510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2510.24s)

example there maybe we'll have an opportunity a show to discuss approaches to the future of anti-aging sometimes that would be cool that's that is my uh my passion for sure so going down that road a little bit and uh and i know we're running a little short on time but i want to ask you what your vision is to take a look at 10 [2530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2530.64s)

years down the road where do you see medicine and you know just life in general i mean we're at this [[exponential growth]] phase of technology and science and 10 years is a is a millennium what can we achieve in that amount of time if we think not just about individual technologies but we think about [2552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2552.24s)

technological ecosystems that create synergistic capacities across the ecosystem i think it's that's a very meaningful thing to think about for the next 10 years because we could just talk about robots that do surgery better and individual diagnostic technologies and individual therapeutic technologies but it's really the [2570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2570.0s)

that entire system's capability that's interesting right i think we will see some radical progress in diagnostic and assessment technologies that'll be things like the evolution of mass spec for metabolomics and maybe home metabolomics so the quantified self devices move from relatively small number of metrics to a [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2591.2s)

lot of metrics and a lot of fidelity of information that leads to big data at the level of individuals i think that'll be a huge thing i think we'll probably even do some further out stuff like laser interferometry for testing more blood metrics without even pricking the blood we're already doing like you know nanobiosen technologies for being able to do advanced pcr-like technology from a single drop of blood so i think ubiquitous data bio data about people and then cognitive and psychological data will lead to our ability to do of course assessment across lots of people but also even big data on a single individual because of [2632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2632.16s)

frequency of testing and all the things that we get a test that will lead to you know early disease indicators also what we would call you know need for support system resilience indicators but that tremendous amount of data will have to be processed on different kinds of processing platforms so i think combinatorial ai interpretive platforms are going to be a really key thing to be able to say all right so we have inflammatory metrics we have nutrient metrics we have you know proteomic transcriptomic metabolomic etc all this data how do we look at each of those biometrics not just in relationship to a [2669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2669.359s)

reference range but in relationship to all the other metrics and see how those metrics are affecting each other and how the causal cascades happen which things move first in response to behaviors or environmental stimuli that then lead to other things moving that lead to recursive effects and so and this is a this is a very [2688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2688.0s)

unique kind of ai and it will actually require the evolution of the understanding of the of the ontology of human physiology how the regulatory systems interact so we take kind of a complex adaptive systems and cybernetic view of the human as a as a complex regulatory system adaptive system and it allows us to then not just be doing machine learning on big data but actually knowing what to look for for complex causal dynamics so that it actually drops that nearly infinite amount of information back into computable sets and then i think therapeutic technologies will be getting better [2730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2730.72s)

on the medicine side in terms of i mean already seeing immuno oncology it's like one of it's one of the first things coming out of what we call traditional medicine pharmaceutical medicine that is for something that isn't acute that is actually great right so really happy to see that i think there will be [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2748.96s)

a lot in terms of therapeutic technologies for infection many different kinds mucosal infection humeral cellular infection for toxicity and subclinical kind of detox that's another key thing is the really understanding subclinical pathology and how to assess it and address it and then of course how to prevent it [2772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2772.88s)

understanding more about genetic expression and how to modulate genetic expression so there will be therapeutic dynamics at each of those levels and the key of what we'll be coming to is moving towards personalized medicine not just at a personalized towards a few snips in someone's genome or even common torques [2794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2794.0s)

of the genome but personalized to all of that data that we have so we stop thinking about ms as a disease or rheumatoid arthritis as a disease we start and we stop even thinking about cognitive enhancement as a thing that is optimized a certain way give them a rassa tamar we start thinking about all of the different pathways that are involved [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2812.8s)

and the causal cascades the multifactorial causal cascade so we see someone's ms there might be thousands of different pathways that can contribute to the deviation from homeostasis that leads to ms and anyone's ms might be some weighted subset and when i say ms i could mean anxiety alzheimer's anything right some weighted [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2834.4s)

subset of those factors that led to that pathophysiology so then we can know how to do differential diagnosis across the whole underlying causal set possible causal set right the causal phase base see what specific things are actually going on and then not be treating a disease cluster but treating [2852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2852.0s)

the specific pathways that are going on and again where sometimes we are specifically reversing some aspect of pathology but we're primarily focused on increasing system resilience and homeostatic capacity for the body to be able to do that across all kinds of dynamics and that you know [2869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2869.599s)

that looks like increasing efficiency of cellular function increasing efficiency of mucosal membranes you know etc yeah i agree with you and i i would even take it a step further i mean i in 10 years i mean with what we've got going on right now with crispr technology and you know i'm interviewing a lot of the people in the field right [2888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2888.319s)

now crispr the nanobots uh all of this stuff i think within 10 years i mean it absolutely is going to be a bioinformatics field no doubt about that but i i really do see that we are going to be stepping away from disease models it's just not going to exist i mean we're going to we're going to take care [2908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2908.96s)

of cancers we're going to take care of heart disease before it even comes about and if it does come about it'll be something that they can go in and do some editing on the on the immune system and create a response that is ideal and we have a tool right now with crispr that it's like given this it's like being given a uh [2928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2928.8s)

teleporter and not have and not knowing how it's used or or anything like that i mean we've got a technology that is ahead of our knowledge and i think once we start to learn how to use this i mean this technology i mean you can order crispr for your home basement to do it [2944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2944.0s)

do lab work in your basement i mean that's how simple this technology is but it's going to be amazing what comes out of this and nanotechnology on top of that i mean i just uh i really see a whole new realm of of health uh and i think physicians there's going to be a little need for physicians most of the [2965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2965.119s)

time i mean you're going to be looking at computer ai bioinformatics systems you're going to be looking at that can compute much greater amounts of details than the human brain can process as a clinician so you're going to have them running the show for these things and and i think it's going to be an exciting [2985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=2985.76s)

time yeah so when we think about [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] and medicine so thing technology that enables more technology of its kind on [[exponential curve|exponential curves]] so we think of nanotechnology synthetic biology crispr genome editing ai et cetera one of the interesting things is of course you're getting so much more rate of change right so much more change per [3007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3007.119s)

unit time and continuously so that we can't have the same adaptive time periods we've had in the past and our intuitions from the past are less and less adequate at the same at the same time our chance of things up increases exponentially too because any increased power and we've seen this [3026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3026.319s)

with all of the major environmental problems that we see in the world or the application of humans using technology and even you know so many of them in the biotech right that we're dealing with health issues technology has increased power especially if it's not already a self-organizing system has the ability [3044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3044.88s)

to have positive and destructive applications and mostly destructive not intentionally but because we just didn't understand the full causal dynamics that were happening and so with crispr for instance the reductionist approach of this single nucleotide polymorphism does this thing so we're going to remove it [3064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3064.88s)

you know from the genome let's say we take apoe4 but then we're starting to get indication of the role of apoe4 and parasitic immune function and it doesn't automatically lead to alzheimer's it leads to increased predisposition if environmentally triggered in some way so i it's not that i'm not you know fascinated by crispr we we [3085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3085.04s)

spend a lot of time with it but i think that it is critical that we come to understand [[complex system|complex systems]] dynamics much much better than we are even currently close to before we think we understand them well enough to edit the self-organizing code itself and so in as we are working towards that affecting genetic expression through epigenetic switches and through neutrogenomics is awesome and genome editing requires us increasing our level of understanding tremendously well and i think even when we get to the point of the genome editing you're still going to be having to deal with this whole biospherical system [3123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3123.839s)

of the body interacting i mean you know it's the expression of 23 000 genes to make over a million proteins there's a lot going on between the code itself and the outcome and and i think that you know the epigenetics is not going to be going away we may get better at it but it's still going to be a [3144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3144.48s)

major network of complex interactions that just basically will come down to you know living the lifestyle that that promotes the most optimal function of the human being yeah one more thing i'll say about the future of medicine and well-being that we haven't mentioned but that i think is really critical and i'm sure you talk with your [3163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3163.92s)

audience about it often is if we see before someone is would normally be diagnosed with lupus or some kind of rheumatism or whatever we see certain autoimmune antibodies expressing we see certain cytokines expressing well we can say okay so this inflammatory marker causes this illness or we see [3185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3185.04s)

certain hormones out of balance before another illness obviously what that means is that that inflammatory marker that hormone was part of a causal cascade but it was not the beginning of the causal cascade right those are messenger molecules there's something upstream from that we can go all the way upstream and say [3203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3203.119s)

what would the tier one deviation from the homeostatic integrity of the system b that leads to that process and you say all right well health is defined as the homeostatic capacity not being in homeostasis but the total homeostatic capacity of the system and more robust health means more homeostatic resiliency [3221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3221.28s)

ability to handle larger stressors larger deviations from homeostasis without actually leaving homeostatic ranges cool so that's health then we say aging is different than disease disease is some deviation from homeostasis that exceeded the system's capacity to stay within [3239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3239.359s)

functional ranges leading to pathophysiology aging is decreased homeostatic resilience of the system so the system might still be in homeostasis across any particular metric but it has less resilience so increase susceptibility to disease so that distinction ends up being meaningful but you come all the way up [3257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3257.52s)

and you say well it initially starts with some deviation from homeostasis that exceeded the system's capacity illness specifically i mean the system's capacity to respond to so that initial deviation is always going to be either the way the system is interacting the way the human here but we could say this for [3275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3275.76s)

any biological system the way the system is interacting with its environment that is not aligned with what its evolutionary code can process or the overarching behavior of the system that's not aligned with its evolutionary code or an actual problem the evolutionary code problem of evolutionary code means genetic predisposition for illness [3292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3292.079s)

independent of environmental expression but let's just throw that category off to the side for a minute and take the other two so interface with the environment means taking in too much of something it shouldn't have which we call toxicity of various kinds pathogenicity etc not taking in enough of something deficiency [3310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3310.48s)

overarching behavior of the system means exercise posture sleep you know lifestyles stress lifestyle things where the system is behaving in ways that again are not what it's evolutionary code adapted to be able to do well which leads to some kind of system stress dynamics so we come up to those those tier one [3328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3328.319s)

causes and we say all right well we want to be able to optimize human wellness we actually want to make sure we're addressing things at that level right the homeostatic resilience the whole system and also decreasing the tier 1 dynamics since so many of those are the interface with the environment where we have ubiquitous [3347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3347.119s)

toxicity exposures whether we're talking about chlorine in the water to deficiency from not enough minerals in the water to not enough minerals or humic and fulvic acids or microbiome in the soil where the food is coming from to vocs in the paint inside we have modified our environment post-[[industrial revolution [3369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3369.44s)

]] in a way that is not what our genetic code adapted to process that is a tier one cause of so much illness so in an environment that has a lot more nitric oxide in the air and more particulate emissions and higher co2 and you know etc and ubiquitous glyphosate and can [3386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3386.079s)

people be optimally healthy in that environment well no they can do things to support themselves to be healthier than they would be otherwise but this is where our health and the health of the environment that we're in an osmotic gradient relationship with is interlinked and this is where [3404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3404.4s)

optimizing human health and optimizing the health of the entire entire biosphere and the and the way we design our built world the toxicology of it etc are all key so this is where we'd say i can't we can't actually talk about the future of medicine or the future of wellness well-being independent of the topic of [3421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3421.76s)

the comprehensive redesign of the way we do being human on this planet and all of the aspects that are inter-affecting i agree that is very well said the the one area that uh we may differ in and i'm not sure what your thought process is on this but i kind of lean towards the the programmed aspect of aging in our [3442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3442.4s)

genome it's a we're a small group of of of philosophical belief systems that that our dna is actually in a sense programmed to to start to down regulate a lot of the systems that we have and i think that that's that's going to be a major area of the genome editing once we start to identify these these programs that we carry that tell the system you know what don't function as well at this don't don't do as well in monitoring as you have i mean we've got examples in nature of animals that show no signs of senescence whatsoever so i think it's a combination of the two i think there is there's absolutely this [3486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3486.96s)

environmental and biospherical aspect of the things that we interact with that are going to contribute to to this process but i think that there's also a very strong component of uh genetically programmed deterioration of the human being this is probably true if we could have dynamics that were more like lobster or jellyfish [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3507.04s)

in this way that is obviously very meaningful and i think you know sens and rad and those organizations are definitely doing deep dives in what what that could be i think even before we identify that there's a lot we can do to deal with the likely effects of it which is can we induce [3524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3524.96s)

increased autophagy of senescent cells can we protect cells from senescence can we increase development of more stem cells and their differentiation throughout tissues yes you know so we can do those then of course if we can deal with the underlying mechanisms that lead to more senescence than is necessary in the first place [3545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3545.76s)

obviously that's powerful well i don't want to keep you all night and i could certainly do that this has been a fascinating conversation and uh and really thought provoking as well and i'd love to have you back on the show to discuss some some other aspects that i would love to get into i had a whole list of additional questions that i didn't even come close to so well i love being on the show i love your approach to health and wellness and you know vitality and eudaimonia optimization and what you're sharing with people and you know why we call it neurohydra collective is because the goals that we seek to [3579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3579.44s)

you know help bring about here obviously can only happen in a meaningful meaningful partnerships and symbiosis with everyone that's working towards similar goals so i look forward to exploring how we can continue to be aligned and mutually supportive as much as possible in these shared goals awesome well i certainly appreciate your [3601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3601.2s)

time and uh look forward to further conversations likewise thank you my friend music well as you can tell i could have probably gone all day in my conversations with daniel schmokenberger he is a fascinating individual and we've had some conversations unrecorded over the past couple of weeks and we have a couple more planned but he just really helps me to take my brain to areas that um i don't expect not only from his qualia product but also from his conversations themselves he is an individual that is going to change the world and he fits very well into our vision of [3641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3641.28s)

the appearance center for human potential as far as shifting the whole paradigm of a process in our situation it's of the health and wellness process in his i can't even put it into a box he's talking about economies he's talking about health and wellness he's [3662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3662.16s)

talking about commerce i mean everything he talks about philosophically is about this systems approach so very fascinating be sure to check out the links in the podcast details where we will have links to the neuro hacker product be sure to use the code limitless and you can get a 10 off when you order the product with the discount code it's not an inexpensive product but i can tell you the quality of what you get and the ingredients that went in there you cannot break it down and buy those individual ingredients at those dosages for a lesser price so it's a good [3700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3700.24s)

product it's a excellent mix of nootropics that are designed to enhance the system not to supplant the system so be sure to check it out and also be sure to check out the appearon dot academy to see about all of the coaching classes that we talked about at the beginning and i look forward to speaking with you [3721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKDNStlnL4&t=3721.2s)
