welcome back to the emerge podcast today i'm joined by daniel schmachtenberger daniel is a social engineer and evolutionary philosopher and strategist he is the founder of critical path institute the emergence project and the co-founder of the neurohacker collective daniel has become very well known in the weird corner of the internet that this podcast occupies the [[sensemaking]] media the meta media whatever we're going to call it in any case for me personally daniel's thinking has colored many of the conversations i've had on the podcast [52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=52.719s)

and his formulations his kind of abstractions have been named by many of the people that i have talked with daniel is a close collaborator with folks i've had on the show people like jordan green hall and zack stein daniel was also kind enough to offer to come back on the show if there are any follow-up [75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=75.84s)

questions uh that people have if while you're listening to the conversation or after you finish listening to the conversation you have uh some uh some questions some curiosities that you'd like to hear daniel reflect on you can send them to me on twitter i'm at d thorson or you can email them [97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=97.439s)

to me i'm at dthorsen gmail.com i will collate those questions find a way to kind of rank them and prioritize them and then maybe we'll do a sort of ama episode with daniel sometime in the future who knows all right without further ado here is daniel schmucktenberger on the emerge [119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=119.68s)

podcast music the emerge podcast is proud to be sponsored by the monastic academy for the preservation of life on earth the monastic academy located in lowell vermont is a training center dedicated to the amplification of human maturity in the age of the [148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=148.08s)

anthropocene the academy trains its participants through a unique combination of rigorous contemplative training project-based learning and a disciplined commitment to ethical behavior all held in the context of deep community the monastic academy is currently [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=169.28s)

as you've been wrestling with our era has already flavored many of the conversations we've had on the show with people like uh jordan greenhall hansi frynakt bonita roy you know your thinking has in various ways informed those conversations and so this conversation is going to assume uh some degree [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=260.079s)

of uh background knowledge about your approach to the kinds of inquiries this show is all about collapse phase shift um human potential yeah and and to to start off i think i would love to hear your take on on what i think of as the kind of current state of play you know my sense as an observer of culture is that things seem to be accelerating as they have but there's a kind of like i don't know some sort of point that's been reached uh pivot point or something you know collapse is puncturing the mainstream discourse you can look at the new york times article on the rebranding of the pinkertons to be kind of like uh post-collapse militia uh you can look [303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=303.36s)

at jem bendel's deep adaptation paper getting just more attention than like any other academic paper that gets published and it wasn't even published it was just put on the internet or the fact that extinction rebellion is gathering so much steam and i'm curious like what are you seeing [322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=322.4s)

now and if there's anything that has changed in your models or expectations or sense of how the how collapse or phase shift will unfold yeah so you're mentioning that the uh general zeitgeist is getting more uh familiar with and considered about collapse models and i think thinking about uh the emergence [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=352.24s)

of that phenomena historically is kind of interesting so there have been some people talking about something like an eminent phase shift that would either look like collapse or emergence forever right i mean for a very long time and that's the way i think about it is that that's [374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=374.479s)

a way of thinking about the biblical rapture story uh it's a way of being able to interpret the end of the mayan calendar or the end of satyu kaliyuga in the beginning of satyuga in the hindu system is that the idea that we're in a time that doesn't continue the way that this time has been unfolding and that at a certain point there's something like a hard fork [397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=397.44s)

we can see that being a pretty old idea right and kind of the way i think about that and i'm thinking about metaphorically i don't know what the actual history was but let's imagine that we're thinking about kind of the rapture story from from christian and you know even earlier jewish kind of [416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=416.319s)

thinking so if we were people like you and i having a conversation like this where we're thinking about the future during the bronze age and we're noticing that as we've continued to develop more powerful technology we have developed more powerful technology of warfare so [438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=438.24s)

you know as soon as we get arrows and then as soon as we get arrows that can pierce armor and you know armor and all those things that there's an escalation of military capacity on all sides and we can kill a lot more people from further distances than the records of previous warfare and it's [453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=453.68s)

pretty clear that we're going to keep developing more projectile capacity and you know we're going to get catapults and then cannons and whatever and we're also developing technology for accumulation being able to store resources so that there's more of an orientation to uh accumulate surplus and the ability to extract resources everything from you [475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=475.44s)

know better saws to take trees down and better fishing technology to you know smithing technology and so we can see that as our technologies growing both our capacity to kill each other and our capacity to unrenewably destroy the environment and so we see that there are deserts near our civilization that are the results of our unrenewable agriculture and forestry [495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=495.68s)

practices and they're growing and that the military technology we're getting that's up ratcheting is also up ratcheting on the other sides and it's not that hard to just kind of run the scenario and say okay if we keep increasing our technology and using it in ways that directly harm each other or indirectly harm the commons we [515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=515.919s)

just don't get to do that forever on a finite playing field and so there's a reckoning that's going to come with how we use power as we keep getting more powerful and so we get the kind of purgatory story that there's right now it's only a few patient people profits that see that it's going to go this way but there's a certain point at which the fact that we don't get to keep going this way becomes eminently obvious to everyone and if we continue to try and use our power in game theoretic ways that advantage self at the expense of other or commons and in doing so we have to get more we have to get some asymmetric power over [555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=555.12s)

the other seeking to do that and the moment we deploy the asymmetric power it gets reverse engineered and iterated on so all sides are exponentially up ratcheting power that is used to externalize harm as soon as that becomes eminent then there is this kind of great reckoning of if we keep doing that we do we don't get to keep doing that in [576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=576.72s)

a sustainable way so we get something like a collapse in a health scenario and to get something like a not collapse scenario we have to be safe stewards for our power and we don't really have any record of the thing we call civilization using our power all that well right meaning we've of course used power to do [596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=596.56s)

some lovely things and a bunch of dreadful things but if we take the distribution of the types of choices that we made as sumerians or romans or british or egyptians or whatever and we multiply the power of how we've made choices by an exponential set of capacities that self-terminates everywhere because [616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=616.079s)

and this is where the mythopoetics of heaven on earth or the consciousness chains that would have to come comes in which is if technology gives us something like the power of gods we have to have something like the love and wisdom of gods to be able to rightly wield it otherwise the misapplication of that power self-terminates [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=634.88s)

and so i think that metaphor holds quite strongly and i think we can kind of think of it as that we're entering something like the purgatory phase where rather than a few patient people recognizing it you kind of have to be not paying attention to recognize it and whether we're looking at [[climate change]] or we're looking at biodiversity loss or species extinction or specific cases like loss of you know pollinators or issues with coral or getting to you know peak oil peak nitrogen peak resources of different types or we're looking at the effects of exponential terrorism or [675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=675.04s)

exponential warfare or the massive human migration issues that could be occurring or even accidental externalities for more powerful tech like ai or or crispr and biotech it's not like there's one collapse scenario like there's lots and lots and lots of them and even if we protect it against several of them all that does is move [696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=696.64s)

the curve of when the collapse happens by a tiny bit because we're developing power on all fronts and using it in ways where we're advantaging some metrics meaning either advantaging some in-group at the expense of out-groups advantaging the near-term at the expense of the long-term advantaging a particular metric like gdp at the expense of other metrics like [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=715.279s)

biodiversity and as long as we are advantaging some things at the expense of other things with exponentially more capacity to do so that's going to be [[self-terminating]] across all of the applications of the power and so yeah i think it is fair to say that we're moving into a place where at least there is a general sensibility of [735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=735.12s)

this that is increasing and even amongst some smaller populations like people on your you know listenership probably some deeper understanding that it's not one scenario it's a lot of scenarios and it's not the result of a few bad dumb people it's actually the result of the structure of civilization itself [752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=752.8s)

yeah yeah yeah and and so i'd be curious um i i believe that you've read jem bendel's deep adaptation paper and he was on the show and we explored together his sense of what he calls the inevitable near-term collapse of [[social system|social systems]] due to [[climate change]] and obviously that's even that's just one vector of collapse right [776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=776.56s)

is is ecological related collapse and so uh that that question of like we're past the point of no return and now it's sort of inevitable a lot of people i hear are looking at this situation that way that we're kind of past this point of no return how do you relate to that possibility is that something you're tracking [798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=798.16s)

and and like do you agree with that yeah i'm curious what your thoughts are i think that we're past the point of no return uh in terms of that the type of world order that we have and the underlying civilization architectures are definitely going to collapse that doesn't mean that the biosphere [823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=823.519s)

and our species has to collapse with it it just means that if they are if our species is going to not collapse with it it has to figure out new systems for uh mediating itself right and um yeah so i'm i'm not fatalistic about this i'm looking at which civilizations can't further which [845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=845.44s)

which systems can't further from an architectural perspective so like let's okay there's a bunch of things worth looking at first we should make the distinction between an [[existential risk]] and a [[catastrophic risk]] meaning if we if we describe an [[existential risk]] as an extinction a lack of lack to continue our the our existence [864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=864.959s)

as a species there are risks that could be fully existential to homo sapien or even fully existential to say all mammals or all hydrocarbon life but i don't think there's that many of them that are all that probable currently then there are [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] where it's like okay we're talking about [885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=885.92s)

uh some humans in pockets making it through a world war scenario or environmental collapse scenario but we lose so much of what we have developed as a civilization and i think there are a lot more scenarios that are more likely of that class but for now i would just put them all together as [907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=907.68s)

um you know massive to complete collapse type scenarios so if we look at [[climate change]] for instance i don't think there are any [[climate change]] scenarios that very reasonably are existential meaning directly meaning that we create a climate where that is venus formed where [932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=932.8s)

humans just can't live in the climate i don't think that is likely so i do think we can have a situation where environmental issues that include [[climate change]] but also include desertification and fishery collapse and resource issues of various kinds lead to massive human migrations and that those [955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=955.44s)

massive human migrations lead to uh really significantly increased resource pressures which definitely have a good chance of leading to war and escalating war and economic collapse and grid collapse and those types of things yeah and so uh you know in the future thinkers podcasts it's really important to listen to as one of the [980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=980.079s)

most important podcasts i think i've ever heard in my estimation and in that podcast you talk about this idea of scaled interpersonal coherence as being a kind of solution to the current problem set or problematic architecture of our civilization and i'm curious if there's anywhere that [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1000.8s)

you now see signs of the emergence of this sort of [[collective intelligence]] you know the one that could help us thread this needle i understand you may not be able to name the specifics because these things are often very fragile when they're getting going but even just to know that you're seeing like embryonic versions of what you've [1020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1020.32s)

been calling for uh would be yeah just curious to hear if that is happening yet in your view okay so when you were talking about solutions in terms of new types of [[collective intelligence]] and sense-making systems that could inform new types of choice making new social architectures to be able to look at what an adequate social [1045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1045.36s)

architecture would be we do need to to understand adequacy we do need to understand the nature of the problems in current social architecture and you mentioned that uh a number of those were discussed in future thinkers in ways that took a while so i won't take a while with it but i think it might be worth just briefly naming [1063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1063.76s)

what the primary issues are so that then we could say uh emergent experiments that would be interesting would be things that would address these types of issues does that make sense yeah okay so briefly we were just mentioning that there's a lot of different types of risks that emerge from the same underlying dynamics [1085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1085.84s)

i've talked about these underlying dynamics as [[generator function|generator functions]] which means we're not looking at a particular type of pollution or a particular type of resource depletion or a particular type of warfare we're looking at what creates pollution or resource depletion or warfare writ large in the nature of how [1107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1107.36s)

humans coordinate activity and if we can identify underneath all of the future risk scenarios we can identify you know hopefully relatively small set of social architectures or [[generator function|generator functions]] that give rise to all those problems then we can say well rather than solve for the instance of a particular [1129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1129.039s)

collapse scenario can we solve for the class of the [[generator function|generator functions]] writ large and if we could find a finite set of [[generator function|generator functions]] that we could show to be subsumptive that all of the risks come from these things and we could actually solve for the class of those [[generator function|generator functions]] then that would be the kernel of a new [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1146.64s)

civilization model in a civilization that would be by its design parameters not [[self-terminating]] and so we'll just kind of describe that real quick there's a lot of ways to think about why something why a particular system that is autopoetic right that's self-organizing and self-advancing why it would [1171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1171.6s)

self-terminate but it's it's not uncommon if we think about cancer in a body cancer is a autopoetic [[self-terminating]] thing right so the cancer cells figure figure that they can defect on the rest of the body i i am saying this in an anthropomorphic way but they defect on [1190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1190.4s)

the agreement of the rest of the body in a way that has them actually gain more resources they consume sugar faster than the surrounding cells and they replicate faster so they're doing an increased consumption and reproduction but in doing so they're actually debasing the integrity of the entire system and if they succeed if the rest the [1208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1208.799s)

system doesn't reverse them you know stop them doing that then you actually have the most cancer cells right before the body dies and then they all die and so as they are in the short term advancing what it seems like is their mission they are also debasing the substrate upon which they depend and because the cancer cells emerge out [1230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1230.72s)

of a healthy body that can live for a lot longer than a cancerous body can and so in general we can say that if you have any system that emerges out of a base a base layer a more fundamental layer if that emergent layer debases the layer that it emerges out of and depends upon that system is going to self-terminate [1250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1250.64s)

eventually right you can't debase your own substrate sustainably but we can see that nature gives rise to humans we see that humans give rise to technology and then humans use the tech to uh kill each other debase nature and make better tech to do both of those things that's an unstable scenario and so [1273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1273.84s)

if we want to have stability of creatures that have the amount of power that technology enables us to have that is totally unprecedented in the rest of life then if nature gives rise to humans and humans give rise to tech the tech has to be in service to the actual resilience of nature so that there is a closed resiliency loop well building [1295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1295.6s)

technology and infrastructure with the goal of increasing the orderly complexity and the meta-stability and anti-fragility of nature itself is not something we've really like ever done but it's something we obviously have to do right and so we can start thinking about what would what currently is underneath how we develop tech there's [1321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1321.679s)

both a set of motivation structures economic structures um and a type of [[sensemaking]] we develop a particular piece of technology for a particular goal but it's going to interact with a lot of things other than the goal for which we made it which are areas where that can create externality of harm right so there's [1340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1340.32s)

both a change of the motivation of how we do technology the comprehensivity of it the nature of the [[sensemaking]] process that would have to change for us to be able to do tech properly so um thinking about a civilization that is debasing its own substrate [[self-terminating]] just so people kind of get a sense um of why self-termination you know would happen in that way a simple way of thinking about the [[generator function|generator functions]] that a [[generator function]] that i think is familiar to most people is just a topic of [[perverse incentive]] writ large the the idea of what [[perverse incentive]] is which is if we want to look at biodiversity loss and we say okay why are we extincting so many species and why are the large fish species so overfished and the whales and why have we cut down so many of the trees as soon as we have a system where the trees are worth more debt as lumber than they are alive or the fish are worth more dead than [1401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1401.36s)

they are swimming in the ocean and war raises gdp and is more profitable than peace and sick people are more profitable than healthy people then and on and on underneath all of those problems is a [[perverse incentive]] complex where someone has a lot more incentive to cause a problem than they do to not cause a problem right yeah and if we take a look at the like dead trees example we get this [[multipolar trap]] where i don't me cutting down this tree or these few trees is not killing all forests but it is getting my family meaningfully ahead and my f you know like if i leave them my family doesn't get ahead and doesn't even [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1443.84s)

eat right and if i do this then my family gets ahead and so i don't think about it at kind of a great debasing our whole substrate scale and i don't even think i have options because i don't necessarily know another way other than cutting the trees down and if i don't cut the trees down someone else is going to cut the trees [1463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1463.279s)

down so i don't even have an option to leave them and so if someone else going to cut them down anyways then i might as well do it to be able to get my family to move forward so we have a situation in which each person or each company or each country acting in its own rational near-term self-interest leads [1479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1479.279s)

and so each person doing what actually seems smart to them in the near term is actually suicidal for the whole over the long term it's a dysfunctional [[collective intelligence]] where the coupling of the choices of the individual actors doesn't couple to good choices at the level of the whole system right so we have a system where [1498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1498.799s)

for the most part nobody really wants [[climate change]] there are some examples there are some exceptions that matter like you know if i was russia i would be pretty stoked on [[climate change]] because the opening up of the northern passage would be economically powerful but for the most part nobody wants [[climate change]] and yet all of us are doing actions that are advancing [[climate change]] and but in our own self-interest i need to just put some gas on the car to drive and what i'm doing is so tiny relative to the whole thing and on and on whether it's an individual actor corporate actor military actor and in the presence of what everybody else is doing and so there's this weird thing [1539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1539.84s)

where the invisible hand of the market the [[emergent property]] of everybody interacting where they're all doing utility maximization within a current system is perpetuating the system so the invisible hand of the market is driving [[climate change]] and driving biodiversity loss and up ratcheting exponential warfare even though no [1559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1559.279s)

actual actors really want any of those things and that is a dysfunctional [[collective intelligence]] right but basically a scenario where we have game theoretic actors whether it's an individual person or a family or a tribe or a nation-state or a corporation or a political party or a race that identifies as an in-group in [1582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1582.32s)

competition for scarce resources with some other out group if they're acting in their own interest then and they're empowered by the ability to create technology whether we're talking about social technology like democracy or markets or physical [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1598.4s)

technology like extraction capacity from the environment or information tech or warfare tech the difference between humans and all the rest of animals and nature in this way because obviously in nature there's a lot of cooperation there's a lot of symbiosis but there's also competition and there are rivalries dynamics and we [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1618.64s)

might see two animals of the same species actually competing over reproductive opportunity in a rivalrous way and even in a zero-sum way and we might see a predator and prey in a zero-sum dynamic one specific predator hunting one prey animal and yet we still see this kind of meta stability in nature [1639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1639.84s)

and so we take this idea that you know hey the lions chasing the gazelle eat the slow gazelle they don't catch the fast ones so then the fastest of the gazelles are the ones that reproduce and the gazelles get faster as a result of what the lions are doing so hey this rivalry is actually good the competition drives innovation [1659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1659.36s)

the lions as a whole if they weren't there the gazelles would actually overpopulate themselves into extinction so the gazelles need the lions and the lions make the gazelles better and the speed of the gazelles getting away a lot of the time has the slow lion starve so the fast lions get faster and you know etc and so we see that this rivalry in this competition is actually necessary because they couldn't maintain without it and it upratchets everybody's capacity and drives this thing called evolution and so we're like okay well that's how nature works so we should work that way and hey that's how theory of markets works right [1699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1699.44s)

and this is basically a simple way of understanding social darwinism where we reify theory of markets as if it's a darwinian process and we say evolution is defined by an environmental niche and then selection dynamics inside of that niche and the selection dynamics are a result of three things mutation [1722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1722.399s)

survival selection and mate selection so the mutation happens randomly in evolution right it's not consciously controlled where a lion gets to say i want my dna to mutate in this way it's just mutation occurs from from gamma rays from oxidative stress from copying errors from whatever [1742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1742.399s)

and so some mutations lead to a slightly longer neck and if that is advantageous because there are leaves up high that aren't being eaten and a couple that have a similar mutation breed together that moves in a direction towards giraffes right and but most mutations won't be advantageous and most of them will fail [1762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1762.159s)

so we have basically mutation and then which mutations survive most of them aren't going to survive they're not even going to be able to eat which and then of the ones that survive they mate with each other and uh only those genetics only those offspring go through so for something to be selected for long term it has to survive and it has to be able to reproduce so we think about markets and we say well demand in a supply and demand dynamic demand is like an environmental niche there is some resource there and something is going to emerge to fill that niche to create a source of supply so then it's usually not one something it's a number of some things competing [1804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1804.32s)

and so you get multiple people or companies trying to make a product or service to fulfill that demand but they do slightly different versions they have their own innovations and that's like mutation right it's like modifications on the product and so most the companies are going to fail and [1821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1821.919s)

only the company that actually figures out how to provide the best value at the best price is the one that's going to make it through i.e survival selection and then maybe you got a couple companies that are doing something really positive and if they were to join ip it'd be even better so you get a merger or an acquisition [1839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1839.44s)

and that's like kind of mate dynamics where you get recombinatorial dynamics on the underlying innovations and so we say well great so markets drive innovation and uh as a result of they drive innovation and the competition pressure is actually a healthy good thing and that's how we get new tech and that's how we actually [1861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1861.279s)

get higher quality of life for everybody this is of course not true at all and silly even though like it's not not true at all there's some truth to it but the reason that it is fundamentally not true and we can't model ourselves in a darwinian way is because the other animals can't upratchet their rival risk capacity with technology and that really changes everything and so if we look at an [[apex predator]] say we take an orca or a lion or a polar bear one lion just can't do that much harm to all lions or to all gazelles or to its whole ecosystem it's just not that powerful but one person today with [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] or biotech can really a lot of stuff up [1907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1907.2s)

and so the system becomes very fragile when one person or one group has so much power relative to the entire system right our technology has allowed us to upratch it our power relative to each other and relative to the other species and relative to the system as a whole in a way that nothing in evolution has anything even closely resembling [1927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1927.36s)

and so you think about a great white and its ability to uh catch fish and then you think about an ocean trawler with a mile long drift net in its ability to catch fish and you're like oh we are clearly not [[apex predator|apex predators]] we can't model ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] anymore because if we keep competing for who's [[apex predator]] in that way but we can pull up miles of fish at once we clearly debase the whole the planet's ability to support us and so the key thing to really get is that in nature the mutations that lead to advantage are symmetrically distributed across the entire ecosystem [1965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1965.519s)

so all lions are undergoing mutation and all gazelles are and there's similarity from some lions to others and there's similarity in the mutation dynamics between the lions and the gazelles and also the everything else so you never get the lions getting a thousand times more powerful in one step irrespective of the gazelles having [1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=1984.88s)

a similar step if they did you would actually lose the meta-stability of the whole system the lion's gonna get a tiny bit faster or the gazelle will get a tiny bit faster through a mutation as that happens then the slowest of the gazelles will get eaten the faster ones will now rebreed and combine and so you get this [2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2004.08s)

thing where power increases anywhere lead to power increases everywhere because there's a symmetry in the distribution of power so that's a result of the symmetrical distribution of mutation pressures and the co-selective pressures the fact that as one is elevating it is having real-time interaction with the other one so they're also elevating which is why an invasive species can ruin a whole ecosystem is that it didn't have co-selective pressure so if we bring an invasive species in that figured out how to have some kind of power that the whole ecosystem is not adapted to deal with it can really massively up a system [2038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2038.799s)

well us developing the kind of tech that we have makes us like like a super invasive species across every ecosystem with nothing ever being able to really check that capacity and so this is where when we recognize no other animal has the ability to destroy whole ecosystems or build [2059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2059.919s)

new types of ecosystems or genetically engineer new species and hybridize new species and extinct species so we we don't have power like [[apex predator|apex predators]] where we can model ourselves that way and all do our own competitive dynamics we have power to affect the world that really only nature had previously and nature is tending to the [2080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2080.56s)

orderly complexity of the whole so if we have that much power it has to be used to actually tend to the orderly complexity and the metastability of the whole or bust right and this very much goes back to this kind of earlier narrative of made in the image and likeness of god and having god-like powers emerge we [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2098.0s)

have to have some god-like wisdom and love for how to steward that or we get um destruction so coming to that and coming back to the [[generator function]] topic to then be able to answer a question of what needs to emerge and where do we see it happening so three [[generator function|generator functions]] that relate to [[perverse incentive]] and re relate to debase our substrate and these things but i'll say more specifically so that we can look at what needs to emerge as something that can deal with these things one is we can't keep running [[rivalrous dynamics]] with exponentially more power and so [[rivalrous dynamics]] can work fine in nature but as soon as we get techne we get the capacity to create massive jumps in power where we can increase our predative capacity faster than the environment can increase its resilience to our predative capacity we can't keep running it that way so given that [[exponential tech]] is happening and it can't really be stopped then we have to develop anti-rivalrous systems for the development and deployment of that tech and anti-rival risk means a nation-state that has its own metrics right like its own balance sheet of its resources its gdp its security its longevity its health care metrics [2185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2185.52s)

a [[nation state]] that can benefit its people independently of and even at the expense of other nations or the commons is a basis for a rivalrous game and a corporation that can benefit its shareholders at the expense of other shareholders of the market writ large or the environment or all the way down to individual [2205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2205.52s)

private balance sheets and private property type dynamics are all the basis of rivalrous games so of course they have been very useful for the kinds of progress we have made thus far they've been so useful that if i say something like problems associated with private property people freak out in the way that like fundamentalist religious [2226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2226.64s)

people freak out when i'm talking saying that their religion isn't the only truth they freak out because they assume that what i want is is stalin's idea to be instantiated right um and that we want some dreadful thing called marxism that was already figured out to be not true and look so it's important that we recognize that if we don't understand the nature of the problem well we can't solve it if we do understand the nature of the problem well we might be able to come up with solutions that we've never tried before of course we're not going to suggest previous systems that also sucked we're going to suggest systems that we haven't done [2266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2266.32s)

yet that involve new insights and new capacities but we've got to even define the problem well to know what we're trying to solve this relates to another [[generator function]] that i'll get to i guess i'll get to it now so the first one is we've got to figure out anti-[[rivalrous dynamics]] so that we're not see one something else to [2282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2282.64s)

understand about the rivalry is it's not just us going to physical warfare with each other or competing for economic extraction from the planet or figuring that to increase on profit margins we externalize more of our costs to the commons in the form of pollution it's also that in a rival risk game true information about reality is a [2302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2302.32s)

source of strategic competitive advantage if i know where the gold is or where the water is or whatever as a tribe then and but there's not enough for the other tribe then i want to hoard that information from ourselves and because i don't want the other tribe to stumble upon it i even want to disinform them about where it is right [2319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2319.28s)

and so you'll notice that in any competitive game any rivalries zero-sum type game disinformation emerges not just withholding but actually disinforming it's what a bluff is in poker or it's what faking left and going right is in soccer or football right like we see it everywhere and of course we see it in the history of tribal [2341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2341.92s)

warfare all the way on to you know advanced civilization type dynamics but the problem is in rivalrous games multiplied by a world with exponential information technology we get exponential disinformation capacity and meaning that we can have a facebook feed that says that ends up having an ai algorithm that [2368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2368.24s)

optimizes it for stickiness for you which means whatever hijacks your limbic system the most which means whatever version of information ends up appealing to your in-group dynamics and your biases and your fear and susceptibility and like that and totally independent of actual good [2386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2386.88s)

information and so if we think about the world today from the point of view of the damage not just to the physical commons but to the [[epistemic commons]] because there's incentive to have disinformation well how the can we solve any problems if we don't even know what the problems are because the [[epistemic commons]] is so destroyed that nobody has [[sensemaking]] how do you do good choice making without [[sensemaking]] well you don't right and so if we ask well how long do we have before the coral die off what will the effect of the coral dying off be will they all die off or will thermally resistant species emerge are they dying off mostly from temperature or from ph change from carbonic acid or from nitrogen affluent affecting the phosphorus cycle or from trophic cascades from a lot of the large fish and whale species so how do we deal with that thing why was nuclear why was north korea about to be a nuclear war with us a year ago and now [2445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2445.359s)

everything is fine for the first time since the 70s what the happened did they really have technical nuclear capabilities how much stuff really leaked out of fukushima is fukushima solved now what is the real risk with ai elon says it's too late bill gates says there's no risk at all what we find is that on the most [2462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2462.8s)

concerning issues in the world that are the most pertinent to the continuation of life on earth everybody gives up on sense-making or defects to believing what their in-group believes because it's too hard to actually figure stuff out and when i say defect i mean defects on their own [[sensemaking]] and so rival risk dynamics are going to lead to not only physical warfare and economic warfare but also information and [[narrative warfare]] which the pollution of the [[epistemic commons]] through that ends up being a destruction of sense-making and the capacity to even know what a good choice would be [2505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2505.04s)

to even know what issues we're trying to make choices in service to and so of course if we have x if we have more people with more power per capita you know totally that is increasingly blind moving increasingly powerfully and quickly that's not a good scenario and so here's something i've mentioned with regard to this one and [2526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2526.24s)

and [[sensemaking]] is so many people have tried to figure out the vaccine thing right like wait are vaccines totally safe or are they totally bad or is it like maybe the ones that cure polio are worth it but not the flu ones or maybe the problem was to marisol but without the themarisol they're [2544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2544.72s)

fine or maybe or they try to figure out the was lyme disease a bio weapon or they tried to figure out what really happened with 911 or whatever it is or the current state of ai and they get so much conflicting information that they just give up yeah right and they give up on actually making sense of it [2565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2565.04s)

but then what happens you have to say well what does it mean to give up on making sense of the world you live in in the most consequential topics well it's a form of nihilism right this it's a kind of epistemic nihilism because if reality is meaningful then i need to understand it to know how to interact in an appropriate way and if i give up on understanding it [2589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2589.04s)

because it seems impossible or too  hard can i actually make choices that are aligned with what's meaningful if i have no idea of what world i live in and so you know something i can talk about what is emerging or not or what i would encourage is for people to look at the nature of their epistemic drive [2611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2611.28s)

and their epistemic nihilism and like how much are they actually committed to making sense earnestly of the world they live in as a basis to have their choice possibly be meaningful come back to that because i want to finish these general functions and i've talked for a long time and you probably [2630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2630.72s)

have questions so briefly we'll say [[rivalrous dynamics]] we gotta address the other thing is intrinsic to how we do problem solving is that for the most part humanity solves problems in ways that make worse problems there's not that many exceptions and whether we're creating a [2653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2653.76s)

piece of technology to solve a problem or we're creating a bill you know or political solution or we're creating a new set of mimetics for like a social solution or whatever any of the methods we have a new company for a market solution so you look at it and you say all right well it was we were running out of easy big [2675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2675.76s)

game and so there was a problem of feeding enough people and whatever so we figured out the plow well the plow was the awesome for us but it was also the beginning of massive desertification and having enough surplus that war was really advantageous for other people to come capture our surplus [2693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2693.04s)

and the beginning of the types of animal husbandry that led to so many of the problems in the world and actually the beginning of certain types of fundamental patriarchies and we're like wow a lot of things got up by the nature of how we did the plow thing and if we all the way back to stone tools if we hadn't got stone tools [2711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2711.599s)

there'd be no environmental issues right like we wouldn't have went and became the [[apex predator]] in every environment and started extincting earlier species if we hadn't got the wheel we come to modern time we say all right we we have you know i think this example is funny but it's actually a a good one the internal combustion [2726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2726.96s)

engine to be able to make the automobile was super helpful for us we could travel further faster easier than we could by horse and carriage by a lot and we were trying to solve the problem of the limitation of horses that we had to feed them that they all over the place you know those types of things and so we the internal combustion engine [2747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2747.04s)

solved the horseshit problem right london was covered in horseshit and the other associated horse difficulties and that's awesome and we all like the quality of life associated with cars but then we look at the proliferation of internal combustion engines that left cars and also went into you [2764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2764.48s)

know tanks and trucks and ships and whatever and we recognize that all of the oil spills in the amazon and the valdez and the you know gulf and whatever and all the wars over oil and the destabilization of the middle east forever and all of the global economy based on the [2785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2785.599s)

us petrodollar and [[climate change]] itself and all of those issues are the result of the success of solving the horseshit problem and because what happens is for us to solve a problem we define the problem in a narrow way right the the narrow problem is defined in one or two or five metrics so we want [2808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2808.079s)

the carriages to be able to go faster with out the limitation of horses or something right and so we're working on a solution to that narrowly defined problem but the solution we create is going to interact with the complexity of the actual world in a lot of metrics that weren't part of what we were designing to optimize and so we didn't say also in as [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2831.599s)

environmentally sustainable way that doesn't create oil spills and wars over oil and you know we weren't factoring those things but for the solution to really be a solution to a problem it has to be larger than the problem it has to be able to overtake the problem and if it does overtake the problem [2848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2848.48s)

and it solves certain definitions of the problem narrow definitions but that it interacts with the complex world where it ends up externalizing harm in other areas but it's larger than the original problem was those places where it externalizes harm will probably be larger or more complex and you know another way of saying it is just [2870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2870.0s)

as humans develop more power we are just shitty users of power currently right um so that's coming back to the rivalrous thing but it's also coming back to the even not rival risk just we aren't [[sensemaking]] well enough to say if we're making a new piece of tech are we making something that even if we weren't doing it for a rivalrous purpose isn't going to [2889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2889.28s)

externalize harm because we're being adequately considerate of not just defining the problem in a narrow way but defining the problem embedding space where we can make sure that our solution doesn't cause worse problems and so this this is a fundamental change in not the nature of whether we're trying [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2907.68s)

to serve a rival risk goal but the nature of our [[sensemaking]] to understand complexity better and to be able to understand the embedding space of our solutions better so this is another thing at the [[generator function]] that we have to address is we have to define problems in such a way that the [2926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2926.319s)

solution to that problem is actually omnipositive rather than positive for something and damaging for something else because it's not just rival risk groups it's also rivalrous metrics right a metric based on theory of trade-offs where we benefit something and harm a bunch of other things and maybe things that we hadn't even [2942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2942.96s)

anticipated is going to create inexorable problems especially as we're as powerful as we are so there's one other [[generator function]] i can get into but i feel like i've talked for a long time so maybe i'll take a break now and see if framing things up this way uh if you have any questions on it or [2961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2961.44s)

thoughts before we start to say well what is emerging that's actually interesting yeah well let's let's wrap up the [[generator function]] like list let's let's finish it and then i i want to respond and we can explore what's going to emerge i think that will work well so the last one briefly is that [2978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=2978.64s)

the way we have made technology is fundament fundamentally problematic in and you'll notice all three of these relate but there are distinctions it's fundamentally problematic independent of how we use it there's this idea that tech is not good or bad its value is neutral and it's whether we use whether we use it in service of which values we can use a hammer to build a house or to you know hit somebody as a weapon this is not true technology has in certain fundamental and inexorable effects in its existence that we actually have to factor and so inherent to increasing power is you know the nature of how embedded within a rivalrous game theoretic dynamic it will lead to the utilization of that power for rivalrous purposes you can't not use it for rivalrous purposes inside of those dynamics so that's how it relates to the the first topic that's the [[multipolar trap]] and where if if anyone uses it for the  up purpose everybody has to or they lose by default and we can't assume that other people aren't going to so we want first mover advantage on using it for the up purpose right and but then als also so technology embedded within a rivalrous context will get used for [3068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3068.72s)

adverse purposes technology defined in narrow ways ends up causing these problems the other one but as we even look at things like the biosphere is made up mostly of six atoms that almost all organic life is made out of and trace amounts of the rest of the periodic table but [3091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3091.44s)

most of the nickel and the chromium and the iron and the uranium and the lead and the mercury is bound in rocks way deep underground far away from the biosphere and it actually took geological processes and hydrological and then early biological process billions of years to get it that way right to get the distribution of stuff [3112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3112.88s)

where we mostly had the organic elements all circling within a very narrow biosphere so the tree is made of the same stuff that the frog and the gazelle and the lion and the virus are all made out of right and as a result of that when the tree dies or the lion dies the microbes can eat it and then the tree can eat it and the and so the actual elements of which everything is made are the same elements with similar distribution and so we can have closed cycle process on it now as soon as we start mining and we start pulling up things that are fundamentally toxic to biology right the lead the mercury the arsenic the [3150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3150.88s)

whatever are all toxic things we start pulling it up in huge amounts and then we start doing the smelting and refining where we have both the active product is toxic and the tailings are also toxic and now we're leaving them up here in the biosphere we're undoing what took billions of years to make which was the right elemental constituents for a healthy [3170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3170.4s)

biosphere well that's a fundamental problem right like so either we have to make our built world mostly out of the same elements that nature make stuff out of or if we're going to use other elements we have to figure out how to have closed-loop atomic cycling on them so we don't have to keep taking them out of [3189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3189.52s)

nature and where they don't become pollution they become like atomically accounted for cycled processes and where those processes that we create we can ensure aren't going to break down into the future so inherent to the nature of something like mining is a inherent toxicity independent of [3206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3206.96s)

how we think we're going to use the stuff right we can give a bunch of other examples of like inherent to the nature of an internal combustion engine is it can't not pollute and it can't not depend on resource extraction it's built into the nature of the tech it doesn't have anything to do with what we try to use it for [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3223.44s)

and this has something to do with making things that are totally different than the evolutionary precedent of the biosphere and of a different kind we make complicated systems nature's complex systems also the interface between the complicated and complex is that the complex is anti-fragile you burn a [3242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3242.0s)

forest it regrows the complicated stuff that we build is fragile you burn a house down it doesn't regrow and so as we are killing more and more of the anti-fragility of nature and converting it into the complicatedness of the human-built world we're decreasing the anti-fragility of the biosphere and making an increasingly [3264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3264.079s)

fragile human-built sphere that's also a collapse scenario so this doesn't mean we aren't going to have tech but it means we have to think about it fundamentally differently we have to think about it in a much more considerate holistic way where we're thinking about what is intrinsically the entire effect across the entire [[supply chain]] of effect of the development of this tech not just the really obvious effect of how i utilize it and so again this requires a different level of both motive and sense-making capacity to be able to develop it rightly so now when we look at all of the catastrophic possible risks whether we're looking at [3303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3303.119s)

any of the environmental dynamics or social collapse or warfare or unintended consequence of [[exponential tech]] we can see these [[generator function|generator functions]] underneath and driving all of those scenarios so then we can say if we could solve for these [[generator function|generator functions]] categorically which means methods for humans interacting that is anti-rivalrous that is building tech in relationship with the natural world in a meta-stable way and that is defining problems in a comprehensive enough way that the solutions don't create worse problems then we would actually have a human [3342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3342.72s)

organizational system a choice-making system that was not driving its own collapse music great so thank thank you daniel i'm having uh the a similar experience that i often have when i listen to you speak where there's a way in which i feel like i i get what you're saying like on both an [3368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3368.96s)

intuitive and a conceptual level like as you're saying it i feel like you're pulling me into your world but then like the typically you know i'm not i'm not participating in the conversation the conversation is on a podcast or something that i'm listening to the conversation then ends and i feel like oh i like understand the problem real well now and i see like how big and how deep it is for the first time again you know every time i hear it listen to you speak it's like it on boards this way of seeing again and it's just it like i don't i almost don't know what to do with that [3406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3406.319s)

and there's actually a sense of in me often of like helplessness because now i see the problem and how big it is how vast it is and how like deeply it's encoded into the structure of both the the system that i live in like my civilization and even my own consciousness but then like the work of just even [3424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3424.799s)

reformatting my own consciousness is like real real hard and then i think oh and we have to do this for a lot of people and then we also have to do it for all the systems up and down the stack and i'm like whoa that's a like i i guess what what comes from that is you know i feel like you're in a kind of unique [3446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3446.319s)

position and i almost just want to ask you like before we get into what you're seeing that's emerging it's like are you are you optimistic that we're gonna be able to like do this yeah so most of us have a kind of learned helplessness right where we really want to help the [3467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3467.28s)

homeless person that we're walking past we really actually don't feel good about our busyness to get to something that doesn't matter that much having us walk past another human that's actually really hurting and yet there's so many homeless people and we could spend our whole life doing it that way and not really touch it and that's just one tiny issue and [3485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3485.599s)

there's a learned helplessness where i don't feel like i can keep caring in the same way if i can't act on the care it's too devastating and so i start putting blinders on and i start numbing in a particular way because i can only care about stuff i can do stuff about and it seems like i can do so so both my impossibility to respond [3508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3508.16s)

and my impossibility to even make sense of adequately well our my impossibility to respond will have me turn [[sensemaking]] off also my and care off my inability to even make sense of things will have me turn care off and so i'll tell you a little bit about kind of my process i'm i'm sharing some things that i've come to understand or how i see things as a result of you know somewhat long curve of really trying to make sense of what the problems are in the world but i started with much smaller definition of the problems right it was like it started for me that the problem was factory farms [3559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3559.52s)

and then it expanded to know we actually do up stuff to lots of animals and then like and it kept expanding in steps as i would work with it but at each step there was a devastation of both how horrific and how huge the problem was and then based on that [[sensemaking]] and the care and then there was an up leveling of okay well what could i do [3578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3578.96s)

to help this and a kind of agency that would emerge but then as i would work with the solution that emerged i would realize it wasn't a real solution because the problem was actually deeper and bigger than i was thinking it was now solving the wrong problem so okay we're going to work and put the fences around the elephant preserve so [3598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3598.079s)

the poachers can't get to them to protect the elephants but given that even when we so we succeed at that but we haven't addressed the poverty of the poachers who can't feed their kids any other way and we haven't addressed a macro economy that creates poverty because of a power law distribution on wealth and we haven't created [3615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3615.92s)

affected the mindset towards animals and we haven't affected population dynamics and all those things and so as a result when we succeed at protecting the elephants because the fences go up the poachers move to start hunting the white rhino that's more endangered than the mountain gorilla right this was an actual experience i had when i was 13 [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3634.0s)

working with activism project and i'm like wow the best solution because it didn't understand the problem well enough actually made a worse problem it moved the harm to a more sensitive area so then understand the larger definition of the problem and then try to work on a solution there and that would happen again and so then that took [3653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3653.76s)

me on a process to kind of the maximum abstraction of [[generator function|generator functions]] of all the things right but at each step as there was a deeper understanding of the nature of the problems there was a while before there was a up leveling of a sense of agency now if i'm going straight to the most [3670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3670.4s)

abstract in general case there aren't all those steps of the up leveling of agency and then there's going to be like oh  i went from thinking about what i could do with a community garden to you know how do we deal with the nature of how human sense make technology differently and [[rivalrous dynamics]] writ large globally and so something i can say is like so part of my process this may or may not be relevant for anybody but part of my process was in facing the actual situation of the world was there were a few vows that i made when i was pretty young actually teenager the first vowel was that i would never turn away from the [3712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3712.96s)

pain of the world like like decide i'm not gonna um go to the factory farm and i have an opportunity or avoid the poor area or turn off the peta video that i wanted to actually see the world that i lived in and what was going on because i didn't want to be able to be live in a blind bubble right [3735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3735.119s)

so that was the first vowel and then the second vowel of course when you start to do that you're it's devastating and so then the next vowel was to feel all of it and not go numb and then the next vowel was to knock if if not going numb not getting stuck in anger and blame and then the next vow is to also not get [3757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3757.28s)

stuck in hopelessness or overwhelm those were all basically unacceptable choices so the first one of i just won't look at the problems i will live in a tiny bubble where i get to feel like i'm succeeding while there's massive suffering and torture happening is a kind of dissociation that makes me as if a sociopath right i'm stoked [3775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3775.839s)

there's huge pain in the world but i don't have to care about it so i'm like all right that doesn't work and going numb getting stuck in blame or getting overwhelmed doesn't work so it's like the only  way through is to say i'm gonna feel it all i'm gonna recognize that the devastation the anger whatever [3795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3795.599s)

is a result of love which is if i didn't love the animals if i didn't love the kids if i didn't love the environment if it wasn't beautiful to me i wouldn't care that it was being harmed but underneath every one of underneath the fear the anger everything is a reality that is so beautiful that i love which is why i care [3813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3813.039s)

so then i trace it back to the love and i feel that and i also tune in not just to the tragedies that are happening and could happen but also to the intrinsic beauty and meaningfulness of life and then i say okay i have some agency i don't have god's you know omnipotence but i have some agency so what do i do with that agency in service of what i care about and you know every time i meet a nurse who's who actually really cares about the people that she's nursing and makes the pain of what they're experiencing when they go to the hospital less painful has them feel cared about like i feel this i feel this kind of existential relief that she's doing that or he's doing that and every time i find someone who is tending to street dogs and tijuana or anything even if it's not addressing the [[generator function|generator functions]] of x-risk like all those things matter and for a lot of people they will [3883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3883.039s)

understand the big picture and they'll say i'm glad some people are working on it i care about all of it but based on the [[sensemaking]] i currently have and based on what i know how to do this is where i can actually add value and the last thing i would want to do is have is have the nature of my [3900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3900.319s)

communication say because those actions aren't totally sufficient for everything that you would feel less motivated to take them no i want people to feel deeply motivated to do the things that they actually can do that are expressions of their care music and some people will be oriented to the [3920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3920.079s)

kind of abstractions to say well how would we build a new resource provisioning system a new economics that reverse that removes [[perverse incentive]] um or a new [[collective intelligence]] system that doesn't have some of the failings of our existing governance systems and so the people who are called to abstractions and to systems like that awesome i want you to work on those things but whatever it is that you're called to there's a lot of things that actually need to happen and just because something doesn't meet the sufficiency doesn't mean it's not necessary right there's a lot that's necessary and so you know these vows for me [3960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3960.96s)

i'm sharing because they're ones that i hope other people take a version of their own version of which is how do i stay connected to what i care about in the world and how do i stay empowered in my relationship to what i care about thank you for that that feels really important uh [3980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=3980.559s)

to to to presence after uh the work you did to to name the [[generator function|generator functions]] and yeah so now that we have that ground covered conceptually uh what are you seeing that is emerging that is sufficient perhaps to base a new civilizational operating system on or however you want to frame it yeah what are you seeing [4008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4008.64s)

that's emerging it's a very interesting question um in terms of things that are seeable uh there's nothing that maps to sufficiency yet that doesn't mean there isn't progress um so do we see types of [[collective intelligence]] processes that could solve problems without making worse problems and types of resource provisioning that could solve [[rivalrous dynamics]] at scale no not yet do we at least see more people understanding some of these dynamics and taking them seriously in a way they hadn't yes that's one thing that's emerging is [4062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4062.799s)

actually just even a higher level of conversation and consideration which is always going to precede the ability to address the things emerging in that conversation now you know if we look at things like uh dow stack or back feed that's working on kind of dao based governance structures [4087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4087.68s)

or um you know holochain or other of the groups that are kind of at the front end of the decentralized computing decentralized governance process that are working on better systems of governance and [[collective intelligence]] do they map to sufficient yet no are they making progress that is actually meaningful over [4110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4110.0s)

previous systems yes um so that's an example of some spaces that are interesting as we see more groups starting to explore um things like [[collective intelligence]] and small group process and seeing how shared [[sensemaking]] can work better than just the org chart of a [4136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4136.319s)

corporation or a government or a traditional academic type dynamic i think the [[collective intelligence]] group process space there are things that are moving in the right direction it's interesting on the topic of things like the work in psychology or psychospiritual development feels like it is both some of the most important and most problematic work happening um because the software of rivalry is embedded in us right it's embedded in our psyche and so as long as i've got underlying insecurities that i've been trained have to be resolved by getting other people's [4184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4184.319s)

approval of me in relationship to being better on finite metrics than the other guy then we're just we just can't work with those types of people to make effective [[collective intelligence]] very well and trauma is autopoetic right the more traumatized i am the more likely i am to behave in ways that will perpetuate [4205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4205.04s)

trauma to myself and others so trauma healing and actually dealing with the underlying bases of rivalrous conditioning in ourselves and learning how to have more authentic and effective relationships and communication with other people this is all super important the place where so that's all stuff i'm inspired by i'll tell you [4227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4227.36s)

the place where i'm concerned about it is where where people actually get overwhelmed by the problems of the world they seem too big so they say well i'm just going to focus on my own healing and the world will magically shift through the morphogenetic field change as our consciousness elevates [4246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4246.96s)

or the right solutions will kind of magically emerge out of this and it's actually a way of disconnecting from what they care about in the world and yet feeling some sense of um soothing or or agency and so you know one thing i would say is any psychology that is helping people actually be more okay with the things they shouldn't be okay with is not good so helping people just be at peace with institutionalized violence and um you know broken systems like i i am very glad that someone didn't talk gandhi in the early days [4296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4296.159s)

into just understanding that personal development and working on ourselves and becoming the change in our own self was the only thing to do and to not have like to not focus on the british empire because that was just an expression of his own upset and unhealed traumas um you'll notice that you know whether it's jesus with the [4318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4318.64s)

romans and the jews or martin luther king with the current state of affairs regarding black people or gandhi with regard to the british empire like they weren't they weren't actually trying to just be peaceful with what is they actually cared about then reality enough that there were things where they're [4337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4337.36s)

like this actually needs to change and i'm interested in the kind of psycho spiritual development that empowers me to change it not the kind that is kind of like spiritual opiates yeah i've listened to all of your podcasts all the appearances you've made i think i've read everything on civilization emerging i think there are a lot of people like [4355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4355.12s)

at least in my weird corner of the internet and the sign of subcultures that i participate in who are kind of like looking to you for answers solutions and the way forward and i i guess i'm like curious about you personally like how are you relating uh are you like aware that there's that kind of expectation [4374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4374.32s)

or that that's put on you or that people look to you that way and like what's it like to be that person around such like deeply critical topics well i feel like you know i've i've had the fortune to spend a lot of time with people that have helped me make sense of the world a lot and a lot of them people who don't speak publicly because they're oriented to be making sense of the world rather than other things and then you know been able to bring a number of frameworks together that seem like they are adding useful clarity to the ability to make sense of the world and [4417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4417.52s)

um you know what i'm i'm focused on how do we actually design solutions to these problems but i'm also focused on just you know in the last couple years starting to share some of these frameworks in a way that can hopefully support as you're mentioning an up leveling of the collective [4439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4439.52s)

consciousness intelligence consideration around these things so that you know not just those of us who are working together but in a decentralized way more people are informed by the things that i have found useful uh and so insofar as some of those things that resonate with me are resonating [4461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4461.04s)

with other people i feel happy about that and you know it's interesting there's something that i think about like when you're asking though what do we do if we think about the psychology of people who have done fundamental pioneering and fundamental invention and discovery they don't ever get to ask anyone else how to do what [4485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4485.6s)

they're doing right like that's intrinsic to the nature of figuring out new stuff is that you can't ask anyone else how to do it now that doesn't mean that you don't learn from a tremendous amount of stuff and stand on the shoulders of giants but then if you're newton you're standing on the shoulders of giants you're making sure [4505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4505.52s)

you've learned those things but you're also then advancing the edge and there's there's a kind of there's a kind of psychology that is necessary to be willing to work at something that nobody can tell you how to do and that there's no precedent in a history of smart people at figuring out [4527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4527.6s)

and it's not hubris it's just a depth of care that can't turn away and there's like the i can't not focus on this so even though i have no idea if i'll succeed i still have to be working on it and you know i think that growing up as kids most of us got most of our praise [4556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4556.48s)

from doing things that the authorities wanted us to do and that had already been figured out so we got the right answer to to answers in sunday school that the teachers had already predetermined what the right answer was or in actual school where we figured out how to spell our math or whatever or winning a game where the rules of the [4577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4577.12s)

game were set or doing the chores where we didn't really have a say in the nature of how the house was designed or and so we get all this praise for doing things that are already figured out that someone else tells us to do and almost all the times we got punished were for doing something that we wanted to do and so there's a very deep psychological [4597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4597.28s)

program that is running that has to be unwound because that psychology is itself one of the [[generator function|generator functions]] of the problem it keeps people perpetuating the existing systems and so you know if someone asks me well what should i do i'm more interested in the meta question [4618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4618.32s)

of like how do you i can share some things with you and a number of people can share some things with you but how do you navigate sovereignty in a way that says when i come to the edge of things that aren't known how do i figure out what to do how do i discover stuff as opposed to do stuff that [4639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4639.84s)

somebody else told me is the thing to do like that there's a there's a psychological shift there that is really critical so that's one thing and coming together with other people that are also really earnestly endeavoring to figure out how to do things that they care about that aren't currently known and figuring out how to actually [4661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4661.36s)

collaborate in that together so how to be in it ourself and how to collaborate with others in it and this requires it this actually requires a mature relationship with certainty and uncertainty where i can sit in uncertainty about something that's really consequential i don't know how to solve the problems of the world yes it [4680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4680.64s)

really matters i don't know how to solve even this particular problem yes it matters but i can sit in the uncertainty which also means the uncomfort of it so that i don't just have to distract myself with something else or default to a quick answer that's the wrong answer because i need some certainty so there's a psychologic willingness to sit in the discomfort of that uncertainty but there's also a psychological willingness to go through the epistemic process to bring about enough certainty to act so it's easy for us to be very uncomfortable with uncertainty and want certainty fundamentalism [4717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4717.36s)

of all kinds does that but it's also very easy for us to to kind of do the post-modern move and be uncomfortable with any certainties and be sure that all certainty is imperialism and only need to rest in uncertainty which means we never have an epistemic basis for good choice and so a mature relationship to reality [4736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4736.239s)

knows that there is knowable and unknowable stuff and within the knowable there's mostly unknown and some known and that even the known my epistemic confidence margin is not a hundred percent and yet there are better confidence margins than others as a basis for action and a mature relationship to all that says that i can sit with uncertainty and i can sit with certainty both comfortably emotionally so that i'm not being emotionally biased one way or the other and i can explore what is the right process to bring about a particular confidence margin for the certainty to act [4776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4776.239s)

i think that people who haven't received a lot of attention often misassess how uncomfortable it is um and miss assess that it'll actually be fun yeah um you know i i had whatever wounded childhood dynamics that created insecurity that sought external [4802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4802.4s)

approval like everybody does and figured out my what i can be good at to get approval strategies and i remember the first times that i was like speaking somewhere that had respectable people respecting me and should have been some kind of success in that way and i remember [4825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4825.52s)

feeling really terrible as the people were focusing on being stoked on me because they weren't focusing on actually caring about the issues and what they could do about it they were focusing on me and that was like actually doesn't do  for me and i'm like no no don't do that [4845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4845.52s)

i'm talking about these issues because i care about them hoping to connect to where you care about them and i'm i have any insights because i have to because i care about them enough i keep working on it and i want to know how we can kind of collaborate together but focusing on me in a way where you get to say like oh i'm glad he's working on that like [4865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4865.44s)

that's actually dreadful um so uh yeah you know i i think that's kind of interesting getting to be part of conversations with people who are really earnestly working on stuff is obviously meaningful and also getting to be in conversations that increase my [[sensemaking]] about the world is meaningful [4892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4892.0s)

and i will say that well you know mostly i talk about ideas that i'm hoping give people frames to make sense of the world that empower whatever they're doing if we never talk or interact you know if they're if there are people who are very called to how do we make new systems and who have um developed some capacities in [4915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4915.679s)

some of these areas there are things that we're researching that could use support and research and so if if there are people who would like to explore the possibility of um engaging and supporting some sense-making uh send me a message well thank you so much daniel for for taking the time to to [4943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4943.44s)

speak about all this and um as we kind of head towards the closing of the conversation i'm curious like is there anything uh at this point that's on your heart or mind that you feel like would be uh would be good to presence before we close this conversation up i really like what you're doing with this podcast and um you know the the fact that you listened to all of the things and read all the things you did and you have really worked to make sense and then want to help advance the conversation and are connected to the you know it seems like you have a community of people [4984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=4984.4s)

that are all kind of at the front of a bell curve of really trying to make sense of certain things in the world and working you know you're working to empower them to do a better job with that and you know when you ask where are there things that are emerging that i feel good about this would be an example [5004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfOuiddmFY&t=5004.08s)

music music music oh music so music music china music uh music huh music you
