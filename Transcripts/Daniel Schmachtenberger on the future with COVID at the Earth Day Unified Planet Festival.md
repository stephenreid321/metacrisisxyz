music all right well i have only been on for about 20 minutes and so i d i don't know all the things that have been covered i think the way i'm seeing the situation the energy that i'm in seems to be a bit more somber than the energy said i am joining in the group and so i don't want to be a drag but if you're asking me to share a few quick things i would say as a result so we're paying attention to [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=39.559s)

earth day and 50 years of earth day but we're paying also attention to the current crisis happening in the world and how those relate and where we'll be moving forward right so as a result of the quarantines and the shutdown of travel probably most of you know the [[food supply]] throughout india northern africa and much of the middle east has been profoundly damaged locusts in some [65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=65.76s)

areas stuff rotting in the fields in other areas but we're looking at a damage of global [[food supply]] for about 2 billion people and that's before we were already looking at related to earth day that this upcoming summer in india and the next two summers have 52 celsius heat waves that were also intended to destroy the crops and lack of ground water and and we go pretty quickly from [87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=87.36s)

the destruction of crops to wars over resource to cleaving along existing tension lines like muslim hindu lines to the escalation of that to things like india pakistan wars and so those kinds of things are unfolding so fast we've obviously never seen a negative price on oil before and the negative price on oil will drive most of the small oil producers out of business to be able to [112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=112.95s)

massively consolidate the power of oil producers but we go from you know during the time of the pandemic it's seeming like there was less emissions because there were less cars and stuff moving to radically dropped prices of oil that start to create whole new markets for demand driving the burning of fossil fuels way over the next little bit we see the [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=133.819s)

increased tension between us and china over this situation as well as increasing tensions in the eu that are being intentionally driven by russia that wants the baltic alliance back and various things like that so and we see ramping militarism right now that china ramping its military forces u.s. ramping its military forces in a way that is unprecedented in the lives of anyone who [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=156.319s)

is on this call we also see the very strong pressure to start releasing quarantine when the the over the the situation the quarantine was created for would be released when ubiquitous diagnostic testing some effective method of contact tracing some early treatment or something are put in place otherwise you just get a spike again and then the information ecology is almost perfectly [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=185.51s)

broken like you see just every day i'm kind of mind blown of articles coming out saying we've did the randomized control trial and hydroxychloroquine doesn't work and it's doing late stage assessment and antivirals almost never work in late stage they work in early stage but it's being said as if it means the whole thing and a few of the studies even said done within the first 24 to 48 [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=206.18s)

hours which is very misleading because it meant 24 to 48 hours of being admitted to the icu which is already late stage but it's the exact words you would use to think of early stage versus information warfare and then there's the santa clara study of oh it's not gonna be that bad because the background levels were already very high but the study was just absolute trash it was [227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=227.81s)

calibrated to have less than five percent accuracy of being able to identify false negatives so it was oriented to about a 20x on the false positive side and so we're making policy decisions based on like and it's important to understand that as far as the political left and right go in the u.s. they're both just doing information warfare through science and then through [253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=253.939s)

journalism so i have identified pretty much no sources of information that don't need further bedding and the virus was really just you have systemic fragility right we lived in a world where we have systemic fragility the virus was enough of a hit to that to start this cascade of things and what happens with the [[food supply]] what happens with the kind of fourth [278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=278.479s)

generation hybrid warfare what happens with this economic stimulus that's occurring and the fact that there's no economic competition at the very top of us and western finance between the 2008 big banks and kind of blackstone and the spb's that the treasury is working with now we are in a situation where a radically different and better world is more possible because the existing one [304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=304.58s)

is more unstable right and it's important to understand that when you have an existing system and it becomes unstable there's more possible change but it's more possible change in any direction and that's kind of thing i want people to get is that right now things are trending in the direction of a lot of just super serious issues that i don't know if anybody has [331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=331.849s)

really prepared i mean nobody could be really prepared for it and so i guess the thing i want to say is to historically we never had fall of empires and transition of power be a peaceful thing like that never happened as a peaceful easy thing there's a difficult phase from the transition of one dominant structure to a new system especially a new global medicine so we [356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=356.689s)

are in a phase where we can hopefully avert a lot of the catastrophes and make beautiful things happen but that we there's no chance of doing that if you don't actually understand who the very powerful players are what they're oriented to do how the systemics works so that there's a kind of positivity that's based on naivete that bugs the  out of me because it's just [380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=380.569s)

guaranteed to fail and waste human effort there's a kind of positivity that says in order to prevent harms and to serve the sacred i want to understand the harm landscape very well so that i can solve all of it and it wants to be super sober and clear to be empowered to actually create positive results rather than pretend that they're already [401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=401.09s)

happening so i think that would be my hope is that people like take their celebration at the beauty of life and they're fearing or whatever at the harm of life and realize they're connected right there's a love of life that has you want to celebrate it want to be hopeful be concerned about it being harmed and transition all that into how can i understand what i need to [423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=423.08s)

understand to be effective and how can i strengthen and fortify myself to continue to be effective of what's going to be very hard work for quite a quite a while not a sprint but you know in an ultramarathon of intense work for some time daniel thank you to us beyond your years we speak for the community and how much we all respect and appreciate your deep [461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=461.51s)

dedication and the integrity with which you hold it these are the most critical challenges of our time so maybe just that one quick closing question is what's your recommendation for us as a community that the people you're speaking to today what can we do together that you you know what would be your kind of invitation right now not everybody has [486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=486.11s)

to understand what's happening with financial warfare and information warfare and cyber warfare to like that's not what everyone's is going to be there's gonna be a lot of people where it's like what is yours to do is to check in on the older people who are lonelier and more fragile and more  up in your communities than they've already been and they were [510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=510.47s)

already very fragile and and so the info that you need for the kind of agency that is yours is the network map of who's vulnerable right and so i'm not saying that everyone should try to be informed in things that are not necessarily what is theirs to act on so getting having some clarity of like where you feel that you can contribute and how [533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=533.31s)

best to do that and as far as people want to be involved in some of the things that i know that a number of people in here want to which is kind of systemic change or change of the underlying infrastructure culture politics economics you you can't solve problems you don't understand and you can't create solutions in a space where you don't understand what's already [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=566.73s)

influencing that space and so i would say just deepen the commitment to what it takes to be effective and it's like there's a lot of things i'm i might want to do but i just don't i just can't pick up a guitar and shred like jimi hendrix if i wanted to enough i'd have to train a lot right and and so if i want to enough i'll train a lot the same thing if i want to understand what's going on [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=591.24s)

enough to have a perspective that's worth anything to contribute i'm gonna have to train at understanding what's going on quite a lot and otherwise i'll probably be wrong about most of it and so yeah i would just like to encourage some depth of commitment and kind of reality check around that so that so that the feeling hopeful is actually based on something real wait there's one [617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=617.43s)

more thing one of the definitions of sociopathy is actually an inability to feel certain negative emotions if you don't feel shame and guilt and remorse you can hurt other people all of the spiritual ideals that have you orient to just wanting to be kind of happy and hopeful and stoked all the time make you kind of a sociopath and so if the world is hurting [641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=641.97s)

in you're stoked you you know like there's something wrong with you it's important that you can actually feel what's going on it's also important that you can say man i failed i worked my ass off and i failed so i can learn if i can't admit that i failed i can never learn what didn't work to do a better job so i want to acknowledge whenever i'm doing something that's working [665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=665.58s)

well and when it's failing not so that i can just be down on myself uselessly but so that i can learn so i both want to acknowledge success and failure i want to acknowledge things that are going well and things that aren't going well and i want to feel that whole range of feelings all the emotions are part of the emotional intelligence system and if you reject any of them you'll be a kind [684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=684.21s)

of fragmented person thank you thank you so much this is it's this is the medicine we need right now and i feel as a collective i feel as that invitation to mastery part of the design of what we've been launching with the up game is half of this year half of every cycle is focused on your own self mastery and your self and your going on your being of like know thyself like how do we [721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=721.68s)

reintroduce things like the aleutian mystery is where we where we bring people back it through ceremony and ritual into like deep relationship with their self and so i feel this is your such a guiding light in our community for this through through integrity thank you so much and i would like to add one thing just since you asked me here i remember so i grew up in a kind of a don [748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=748.61s)

tech community and when i first went to the temple all that i did in the temple was clean the dishes and clean the  floor for months like and i had to earn the right of showing that i could show up and do the thing i said i would do and bring a good attitude to it and whatever and just ground and be able to be present and and service-oriented and like that before learning the first [774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=774.54s)

meditation technique which was then very simple nobody talked about mastery quickly nobody talked about the great mysteries that was like to the extent that you knew about them you never talked about him and and those were earned pretty slowly so i and i have never met anyone who is worthy of the title of mastery who refers to that way bugs the out of me when [799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xreo0fw-4_A&t=799.139s)

people talk about their superpowers and their that they're a polymath and a meta whatever like just other people can use those terms about you but some i have faith in the likelihood for someone to succeed proportional to a real calibrated sense of humility and capability music
