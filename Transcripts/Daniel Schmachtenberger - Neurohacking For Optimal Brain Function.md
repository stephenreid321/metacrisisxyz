welcome to the future thinkers podcast episode number 42 today on the show we have daniel sh martin berger the co-founder and director of research and development for neuro hacker collective which is a smart drug company with a vision of advanced human optimisation daniels past work involved being a dean for a college of mind-body medicine and running a think-tank that focused on developing [[complex system]] solutions to environmental and societal issues we already interviewed daniel on our podcast once before where he talked about complex global systems and you can listen to that episode by going to future thinkers org slash 36 but today our topic is neuro hacking or the voluntary altering of your own brain function to optimize for performance well-being or a number of other factors [45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=45.14s)

and we recently got our hands on qualia which is a newer enhancer or a smart drug stack from neuro hacker collective which daniel is the co-founder of we've tried a few other smart drugs before like modafinil for example but qualia seems to be quite different from the others for example my experience of madeleine was that it made me just dislike people in general although it [68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=68.82s)

made me extremely focused but qualia didn't have any of those side effects for me it gave me a sense of emotional well-being and a general sense of balance as well as focus which was quite interesting the term for this is broad spectrum cognitive enhancement which means that it doesn't just improve one quality of your functioning but multiple qualities at the same time qualia [91](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=91.77s)

specifically focuses on three areas of enhancement cognitive psycho affective and physiological cognitive area includes things like intelligence and creativity psycho effective area includes increasing confidence willpower and empathy and physiological area includes higher levels of energy awareness and responsiveness qualia has also been designed with an ethical [115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=115.86s)

mindset instead of depleting or overriding your brains natural function like some other smart drugs it works to support and enhance without creating dependency there are over 40 active ingredients in qualia and it's all transparent you can check all of on their website and there's 40 plus years of international research on neurotropic stack formulation behind [138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=138.3s)

these ingredients if you're interested in learning more about qualia go to future thinkers org slash brain hack one word and finally before we get in the show i just want to give a quick thank you to our patrons and donors josh alfred lauren and melanie thank you guys for supporting the show we love you to check out the show notes from this episode go to future thinkers org slash 42 and the second half of this interview will be at future thinkers org slash 43 once it's live and to listen to our first interview with daniel go to future thinkers org slash 36 enjoy the show welcome to future thinkers org a podcast about the evolution of technology society and consciousness i'm mai gilliland and i'm uv ivanova to get notified of new podcasts and videos go to future thinkers org and subscribe to our mailing list you can also find us on itunes stitcher and you tube if you like what we do and you want to help us make more podcasts and videos give us a like or review share it with your friends and consider becoming a patron go to patreon.com/crashcourse on our org slash bap last but not least if you want to get access to more content hidden episodes or if you just want to chat with us in previous guests then check out our community at community future thinkers org daniel welcome to the show it's good to have you own again i'm happy to be on again so your last episodes were quite popular but we talked about quite a different set of subjects and today we'd like to talk with you about neuro hacking so maybe [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=236.55s)

can you give us like a brief introduction to what neuro hacking is and why we should be doing it if we should be doing it yeah so neuro hacking is a broad and kind of ambiguous term related to bio hacking and consciousness hacking generally we can think of it as the application of any tools or technologies or processes to modulate augment upgrade some aspect of [257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=257.12s)

psychological neurological function and so we could think of ancient neural hacking technologies being meditation and sweat lodges and psychedelics and dancing around the campfire to get into trance-like states and etc and obviously with advances in neuroscience and neuro technology we've got q eeg neurofeedback we've got transcranial stimulation technologies [283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=283.59s)

we've got much more advanced microbiome ik genomic you know biochemical technologies so we can think of neuro hacking as how do we optimize the mind brain interface towards any positive purpose utilizing whatever tools best serve that particular purpose i love how you say mind brain interface as if there are very separate things well the reason that we're saying mind brain interface [310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=310.35s)

together is because if you want to run the analogy of mind stuff as kind of like software and brain stuff is kind of like hardware you realize that the distinction the clear distinction in computers between software and hardware we don't have such a clear distinction and the human organism that any change in thought has a physical change in the brain that's happening any physical [337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=337.14s)

change in the brain has some change in thinking emotion experience etc and so they are dynamically co inter affecting each other all the time so i suppose a lot of the thinking that we've done about consciousness has come from well it's come from a lot of different perspectives but the one that we land on quite often is the perspective from hinduism and buddhism [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=360.09s)

which is you are not the mind and the consciousness is not exactly localized in physical material in the brain so do you have much to say from that perspective before we dive deeper into neuro hacking yeah so we get right into what's what's famously known in neuroscience as the hard problem of neuroscience how does consciousness and brain right or in general consciousness [382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=382.22s)

and physics how do they what are they both and how do they relate and is there causal interaction in both directions this is the hard problem of neuroscience but before that this was you know the kind of hard problem with the mind brain problem where the the dualism challenge that all philosophic systems faced is it seems like there is third-person stuff right [404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=404.63s)

that we can all independently measure in sciences the method of knowing the third person reality we'll think of as third person or objective reality we can all measure it we can corroborate it and if we're going to you know make hypotheses about interactional dynamics we'll be able to you know make predictions etc and third person stuff has weight and position and charge and length and spin [430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=430.79s)

and those kinds of properties first-person stuff doesn't have any of those right it has emotion and feeling and longing and impulse and it can't be corroborated by anybody else at all right like you are having a first-person experience as we're talking and i can empathetically imagine to feel into what your experience is like but that is different than actually having the [457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=457.25s)

first-person access to it that you do so there both of these realities exist has been acknowledged and there are philosophic systems that don't think that they're both real right you have what are called idealism systems that say consciousness is fundamentally real because it's the only thing we can know i can know that i'm having an experience but i can't know that what i'm [478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=478.28s)

experiencing about the world even through my scientific measurements is true because i could just be a crazy person right this could all be a dream it could all be the matrix and it could just be you know contours within consciousness but i don't i only have first-person experience first-person access to my experience of stuff not the stuff itself and so in those models [499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=499.88s)

what's fundamentally reals consciousness and the rest of universe right third-person self is either not real at all maya or it's an epiphenomena of consciousness mind creates reality you've got the other side and says which fundamentally real is physical stuff material stuff physical stuff happened with the big bang interactions occur that lead to complexity [[emergent property|emergent properties]] have enough complexity and somewhere around biology or maybe [[nervous system|nervous systems]] consciousness is an [[emergent property]] but what fundamentally real is physical stuff and then consciousness is either just not real at all it's called radical diminutive ism so dan dennett and others kind of proposed that it's kind of like an illusion or [544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=544.04s)

consciousness is real but it's an epiphenomena of complex neural networks right radical emergentism so you've got different philosophic systems that don't see both of those has fundamentally real things or reduce them to the domain that seems more role to them or they're stuck with all right these both seem real and they seem uncommon surrett called dualism or attempts to try and reconcile [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=569.06s)

them more deeply and so when you're living your life when your body is touched interacted with sensation happens this is physical right it's being mediated by via biology and physics and yet you have a conscious experience so it seems like physics can affect consciousness there's a causal movement but you also experience yourself having some choice and again we [594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=594.77s)

get deep into not just the topic of consciousness with the topic of will and volition and if your choice is real and then affects your hand moving it would seem that consciousness has some effect on physics and there for every branch where you say well what about that and each of these questions each of these things i've said and the questions that come up there is a whole branch of [617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=617.84s)

philosophy that goes down is there really free will or not is it compatible with the deterministic universe or not is universe deterministic etc but most of what we're gonna talk about today does not require these deep existential issues being solved to say that we do know empirically both first-person and third-person the things that we can do with our [[subjective experience]] so mindfulness meditation introspection etc can actively affect the brain and affect the brain in ways that affect the minds predispositions and things that we can do to the body ie changing its biochemistry changing its microbiota exercising differently change cognitive and emotional right mental and and the experience of the conscious creature and you can [667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=667.91s)

abstract and say well okay so you're saying the mind thinking feeling stuff is different than the body is consciousness different than that as the as the non-dual witness imagem candidate in new buddhist philosophy so maybe there is consciousness as a field effect it is then interacting with this self-organizing system fascinating questions and if you wanted to do a show [693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=693.08s)

where we just dive into them existential questions at depth that behaves i think that's the plan for the next one actually but yeah you bring up non non duality and that's exactly what i was going to say just now do you approach newer hacking from a non-dualistic perspective where it's both ascending and descending in terms that ken wilber uses yeah so when ken talks about the [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=715.34s)

ascending pass he's talking about the transcendent direction and the descending paths the eminent direction right so the transcendent spiritual processes are around in some way having consciousness leave body mind etc and go into higher states of consciousness etc the descending pass around taking universal consciousness and embodying it more fully and if you just want to talk [746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=746.48s)

about it very simply in terms of just having expanded states of awareness and then being able to integrate those expanded states as integrated stages yes that's a valuable way to think about it cool so why don't we move into the actual subject of neuro hacking you talked about the different tools that we can use what are some of the currently available tools for neuro hacking well [773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=773.18s)

so there's a lot of different goals right and so if someone's wanting to decrease anxiety or brighten their mood or increase their cognitive function or have altered kind of you know psychedelic numinous states or improve their sleep quality or each of these goals are gonna have different tools that are more appropriate and then each of the goals are going to have different [796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=796.67s)

tools that are different depending up on the person and what the person she has going on they are specific biochemistry genomics etc so i'll speak broadly about categories of tools that are currently available and then we can get into applications more so think about first affecting the brain and body and this is another important distinction so we look at the [823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=823.139s)

intersection between the mind and brain but it's not just mind and brain it's your conscious experience in your body as a whole and then we could say well it's actually the mind brain body environment complex because the environment and the body are intersecting each other inexorably in real time so these are embedded [[complex system|complex systems]] but let's just talk about the topic of embodied consciousness and conscious experience that is mediated beyond just the [[nervous system]] in the physiology you know the first example that i think people are getting pretty properly aware of is the gut brain axis and the gut brain axis is mediated by via a number of things you've got the enteric [[nervous system]] which is a whole branch of peripheral [[nervous system]] in the intestines where inflammation in the intestines can cause imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic [[nervous system]] can cause more inflammation etc but you've also got the microbiome digesting food and actually many of our nutrients are metabolic byproducts of the microbiota and obviously we evolved with our microbiome over so many generations before we had chlorinated [893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=893.069s)

water and antibiotics and refined sugar diets and so the human genome doesn't actually code everything necessary to make a human the genome encodes a bunch of stuff but we got a genome and a microbiome from our parents and the babies microbiome comes some in utero some from the vaginal flora some from you know breastfeeding but if we damage that a whole bunch of functions [917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=917.25s)

necessary to make an optimum human can be damaged so specifically regarding [[nervous system]] some of the main neurotransmitters like gaba dopamine serotonin are primarily produced via flora in the and so each of those three i just mentioned somewhere between 30 to 80 percent of those neurotransmitters are actually produced in the gut and that [940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=940.619s)

you know moved to the brain if you think about losing 30 to 80 percent of your serotonin or gaba or dopamine that that's you know psychopathology right that's that's a messed up brain so then you start looking at well how many people are eating food that is feeding some microbes more than others and changing the gut microbiome or have some gi disturbance or and so it's important [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=962.009s)

that if we helped the microbiome of someone's gut that's a neuro hack right we can be changing their brain chemistry the most critical kinds of signaling chemicals by changing the bacteria in their gut the same is true if we want to look at say pain anywhere in the body pain can create inflammation that can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause neural inflammation and creates [987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=987.689s)

depression and cognitive issues exercise certain types of exercise can actually affect genetic transcription and change endogenous biochemical patterns in the brain and so you know we'll talk about technologies to affect the brain and [[nervous system]] directly but some of them are technologies to affect the environment that the brain and [[nervous system]] lives in which is first order of the body right so tools let's think about biochemical tools so first line of biochemical tools is things that you can put in your mouth right so we're talking about vitamins and supplements and herbs and drugs etc so you've got anxiety biochemistry things that can decrease anxiety you've got things that can help with sleep you've got things that can help with cognition all all the [1036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1036.289s)

nootropics and smart drugs and then you know you've got things that can create experiences that might not be where you want to live all the time but are meaningful state experiences so let's take psychedelics and say are we optimizing the physiology by taking a psychedelic or are we oughta menteng it moving it into a specific range of function that we might know how to live [1060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1060.47s)

in all the time but that has very meaningful positive effects lastingly if done properly so you've got you just about all the biochemical stuff right now then you've got biochemical stuff that could be injected could go intranasally there's a lot of different delivery methods for biochemical technologies for neural hacking you've got the biological technologies which [1080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1080.81s)

like we were mentioning you know affecting the microbiome of the gut but not just a microbiome of the gut microbiome of all of the mucosa systems the body it's pretty common for people to have infections in their mouth subclinical dental infections or subclinical nasal infections they're actually releasing bio toxins that affect the brain and so they are the [1099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1099.56s)

boundary between good and agreda functional medicine and neuro hacking right that kind of blurs we've got genomic therapies we can think about for neuro hacking so you know we're at the edge of starting to think about crispr and looking at do people with higher iqs do people that are happier more depressed have different genomic patterns and can we actually do gene [1123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1123.02s)

doping splicing etc to affect that and even before looking at it at a genomic level we look at a genetic expression level can we turn on or off or modulate certain gene expressions and there's a bunch of things that do that and then to the degree that we know someone has say a bunch of mutations on their mao branches or their comt branches that code for certain neurotransmitter [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1146.36s)

predispositions can we at least just do nutrigenomics right provide different nutrients for them to bypass where they have new genomic deficiencies you've got so many fun technologies you've got biofeedback biofeedback and specifically neurofeedback eeg neurofeedback which can provide input about the brain to the brain that it doesn't normally get that teaches it how to regulate much more [1170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1170.63s)

profoundly and quickly in many areas we've got all the transcranial technologies so we can stimulate the brain with transcranial lasers transcranial direct current or alternating current transcranial magnets or ultrasound ultrasound s and fascinating studies and early studies in curing alzheimer's right now tms has had some great work in [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1196.25s)

depression and some of the tdcs has been used for hyper clocking the prefrontal cortex so there's a bunch of fun things in there the transcranial laser is low-level laser not just transcranial but sometimes i'll go up your nose intranasal lasers can increase atp production in the neurons so increase mitochondrial output that's a good [1217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1217.809s)

example if you're increasing atp output you're not making the system more moved in a stimulatory direction right you're not affecting stimulating neurotransmitters or neural hormones you're also not doing neuro inhibitory ones you're just increasing the cell energy for it to do whatever it wants to do better which is kind of like a younger brain interesting there's a [1239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1239.23s)

bunch more but you can give me more questions otherwise i'll keep going so you brought up the gut brain is there a feedback mechanism that you can train yourself to pay attention to so that you have better insight or thinking sort of informed by the gut so we could take this a couple different ways we could say that we might be actually looking at the information processing of the [1263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1263.289s)

enteric [[nervous system]] right there is this gut brain got [[nervous system]] that it provides a different kind of input or feedback just like there's a bunch of neurons in the heart and we could talk about the heart as an information processing system you know or the neurons in it at least that might be true i don't think we know enough to know for sure [1284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1284.44s)

we can also though just talk about the benefit of tuning in two different perspectives and being able to get different information so let me give you a totally different example napoleon hills famous book think and grow rich mm-hmm so he said that one of his favorite practices that he developed in there was he had this council of invisible advisors and his invisible [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1310.33s)

advisors were he thought about who he wanted to become and the qualities that mattered most and he thought about people that really represented embodying that quality well and so maybe he didn't want to become genghis khan you know holistically but there was some aspect of kurds that he wanted genghis khan's inside for and so he had you know he had his list [1333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1333.429s)

lincoln davinci ford whoever i don't remember whose exact list was but he studied those people well enough that he could have some real sense of their personalities and then he would convene seeing them all at a council table with his eyes closed in a kind of meditative state and then he would bring life issues to them and ask for their feedback and go around and have lincoln [1352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1352.54s)

talk right then have napoleon talk and one of the things that he found was that when he was asking for gandhi's input he got insight that he would have never got just journaling his own thoughts and he said all right so is it because i am channeling gandhi or is it simply because i'm looking at the universe through a different lens that i wouldn't normally using my own brain and you know [1381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1381.76s)

he said it let's assume that it's the latter but it really doesn't matter at all the net result is profound valuable useful empirically useful insights came from looking at the world through those lenses you can do the same thing with parts of your body and it's actually a really meaningful part of somatic psychology so you can tune in to your gut you can tune in to say you want to [1407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1407.2s)

use the chakra system right and you tune into your solar plexus or your heart chakra your throat chakra does it matter if they're really chakras no it doesn't matter at all does it matter if the chakras correlate to nerve plexus or the endocrine glands or if their nonsense is you're just tuning in to this part of your body and saying what does it want to tell me what does [1427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1427.12s)

it think what is it you know want me to know and some information comes and then you step back in your normal state of consciousness and look at that might you be able to gain meaningful insights from it definitely yeah i think that's a really good way of looking at it because some people you know if they're not used to or if they don't believe that you know if shockers exist [1447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1447.1s)

they might just refuse to use the technique but actually the way you put it you can totally just use the technique without having any kind of belief about it hmm does this work yes it does does it not work okay well maybe i can try something else and you know it doesn't have to just be chakras it's just an example you could just take an area of your body that's hurting and tune in and say what is this heart want me to know maybe you don't get anything but then you just kind of feel the pain and you or the tension or whatever it is and you say alright if this pain could talk what would it say and you see what comes up it's interesting how often that ends up being insightful and when we talk about [1486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1486.07s)

the mind brain interface or the mind body and face there are a tremendous number of places where the top-down regulatory system has huge effects on all the other systems and so we're specifically emotions psychology end up affecting physiology you think about why does a placebo ever make anything better for anybody right like it doesn't even make sense why a placebo like why isn't [1514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1514.899s)

the body already healing at its optimal capacity as it is since it would be genetically programmed to do so and it is already healing at its optimal capacity and taking the sugar pill isn't interesting and it's not even the belief that's interesting it's when someone is in say someone has a disease state they're anxious about it and that anxious is mediated by cortisol and [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1540.58s)

epinephrine and etc and so their cortisol is taking the precursor hormone pregnenolone and shunting it into cortisol in the adrenals which means less of its going to dhea so the cortisol dhea ratio gets higher well that ends up affecting everything from genetic transcription to lean muscle mass to bone density to so many things so then when the person believes they're [1565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1565.6s)

going to get well and they feel better and their stress drops and their parasympathetic [[nervous system]] can kick on they're sympathetic [[nervous system]] chills out and their cortisol dhea ratio moves in the right direction the actual reparative mechanisms of physiology are more available to them and so their body is healing as best as it can in the stress state and in a non [1590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1590.259s)

stress state that can actually heal better right now one of the interesting things is it's placebo is not the only thing that can do that you look at work like norman cousins were where he just watched comedy because he thought he was dying of cancer and his cancer got better not because he believed he was gonna get better but because he was not stressed out and he [1610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1610.27s)

was happy for the first time and ended up being that stress was meaningful to you know the process of pathology that was going on for him and so this doesn't mean that it's the only thing or that it will always be affecting sometimes placebo just affects how you sense something but not the underlying pathophysiology but it's a part of it so when you tune into pain in the body for [1631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1631.42s)

instance or tension in the body is it possible that there is some psychological that's happening there where you can gain insights austin are there other ways of affecting cortisol in your body that are meaningful in the long term other than this kind of observing your body and releasing it consciously oh yeah so this is like the first place that functional medicine [1661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1661.29s)

doctors and naturopathic doctors talk to people which is understanding how the hpa axis works and that the dysregulation and the hpa axis usually starts at the a at the adrenal side and that roughly you can say the sympathetic [[nervous system]] innervates the adrenal cortex and the primary hormone there's many coming from that processes cortisol and the parasympathetic [[nervous system]] innervates the adrenal medulla and there are again many hormones that are coming out but the primary one is dhea so the ratio of cortisol to dha as hormones in the endocrine system in the blood representing kind of systemic effects is roughly equivalent to the sympathetic parasympathetic ratio of the system as a whole and you know related to chronic stress so in early phases of chronic [1712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1712.81s)

stress cortisol goes up and the precursor the cortisol in the brain and acth goes up after that's been the case for a little while dhea starts to go down because cortisol and dhea are both made from the same precursor hormone called pregnenolone and it's a rate limited hormone there's a finite amount of it after a while if someone stays in chronic stress cortisol [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1735.879s)

starts to drop too simply because the adrenal glands are fatigued and now dha is way lower so you can see people in high or low cortisol adrenal stress states depending upon how long they are in that pathology but so so you can you can give someone bioidentical hormones or things that support hormones to get them in the right range quickly and make the person feel better so say you do a [1762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1762.94s)

blood or a salivary hormone lab to look at adrenals you can do that but the big thing is just going to be dropping the stress low and the stress load is psychological and physiological so too much sugar and an unstable blood sugar cycle causes cortisol spiking body reads it as stress can continuous starvation cycle responses not enough sleep is a huge cause of stress both not enough [1788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1788.349s)

exercise or exercising in a way that's causing injury so you've got and as well as toxins and pathogens that cause inflammation so all of those can cause chronic stress as well as all the psychological sources so one of the you know you can say that the first good part of neuro hacking is just health right health and well-being because so many people are dealing with brain fog [1813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1813.729s)

or low-level anxiety depression before they seek to optimize beyond baseline just getting back to baseline is pretty great so identifying the things that took them below baseline and reversing those that shouldn't be the foundational stuff right i think so many people neglect that they're trying to kind of go to superhuman levels rather than just trying to optimize for what's missing or [1841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1841.419s)

for what's kind of below normal levels so what else is in that spectrum of what people often overlook we've talked about cortisol we've talked about the gut microbiome are there any other important components of this equation sure this is not the sexy part this is the like  don't tell us about the stuff again part but it's just it's critical and then the sexy part is the stuff that [1866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1866.19s)

seems like chick bullets that make you make you have superhero powers so we'll get more into that the end but those parts really do there are some really neat exciting technologies that can be very powerfully augmenting but they really do function radically better in a well-tuned system in an already dysregulated system doesn't mean they can't help to get you [1887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1887.46s)

back to functions in a dysregulated system but we really want to be functioning on foundational well being so first category asleep i say this because it ends up affecting more categories of health and psychology faster than almost anything else and it's something that is just so easy for most of us to do a poor job with by sleep i mean both enough sleep and good [1916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1916.169s)

quality sleep so even you know it's give or take a third of your life but it's like 90 percent of all the repair that happens to your physiology and you've got some very meaningful information consolidation psychological consolidation happening in dreams and theta almost all the physiologic repair happens in delta it's also where the [1939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1939.419s)

memory consolidation happens so making sure that we're getting enough delta sleep i would say is a is a huge foundation now we've got neuro hacks for helping that you can you know one should make sure that the foundational things are in place so that environmentally do you have a good sleeping environment you have a good bed is it dark is it quiet good air quality you're not in a room [1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1964.71s)

with mold or boc etc and you don't have people or dogs or whatever waking up throughout the night we could do a whole show just on how to make it optimize sleeping environment and it's a pretty important thing factoring how how big a deal it is and then there are definitely supplements that people can take that will help them sleep better depending upon what's wrong with their sleep but [1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=1990.39s)

if they're if they're not saving locals they're waking up to pee a lot versus their snoring right those really need addressed in different ways but addressing them is really important there's also the amount of light that you received before sleep so many people stay on their phone right before they go to bed and that can have really terrible [2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2009.65s)

implications because your brain doesn't produce enough melatonin yeah so cortisol and melatonin are in a circadian rhythm with each other where cortisol is high in the day low at night melatonin is low in the day high at night and it's a light stimulated cycle and so it's actually important to get enough bright light during the day if you don't and your cortisol doesn't [2031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2031.82s)

actually go high then it won't come low enough and give you good sleep at night but it is important to avoid bright and blue light before bed so you see a lot of people wear of blue blocking glasses or the flex app on their computer to take it out of the blue range you know things like that in general i would say a winddown routine before bed where you stop taking in stressful things you stop [2056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2056.0s)

blue in the bright light and you start preparing body and mind for sleep whether it's through a bath or the right kind of reading or stretching super useful we're working on some technology some biochemical technologies that induce better delta sleep a number of different ones one of the ones that were most excited about is a new kind of brain inductions called phase-locked [2082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2082.82s)

induction and this was a darpa funded project originally with some people that were partnered with out of university of northwestern and rather than try to induce delta waves like using binaural beats or strobe lights or transcranial stem these researchers recognized that the brain actually resists having its brain wave patterns changed externally pretty [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2112.04s)

strongly because its own process for regulating the frequency that it's in which is the opening and closing of the ion gates is very very sensitive it's controlled by many factors and it's really only susceptible to induction when the gates are open and the ion channels are open and so they put eeg on people's head found out when the people went into delta sleep [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2135.65s)

they're specifically trying to improve the efficiency of delta sleep and then exactly when the gates were open they put in a stimulus for the exact same wave pattern the same frequency that the brain was in where it was crest crest aligned so they weren't changing the brayton wave pattern they were just adding more of the exact brainwave pattern that the brain was in to add [2158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2158.839s)

amplitude which the hypothesis was would increase the efficiency of everything that was happening because you get more net communication per unit time happening and this happened and so the first studies that were done were done on memory and they found a 400% increase in long-term memory and healthy adults after a week of using this technology and that's testing memory but if delta [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2184.94s)

sleep is going up that's going to be helping anxiety it's going to be decreasing risk for alzheimer's and the effecting oxidation and the inflammation so this technology is not far from being market ready this is an example of like really fun neural hacks that were right on the brink out that is so interesting it sounds like it's almost tricking the brain into thinking that is doing a [2208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2208.009s)

better job at whatever it's already doing than it actually is and i wonder if it has a feedback loop where the brain picks up that oh this is really working and and then it knows how it arrived there because it was already doing that maybe just to a smaller degree and then it already knows how to do that and it does it better next time is that the case so there are some [2229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2229.339s)

therapies where after you do them the brain continues to do them on its own because it learns how to do them that's kind of the exact opposite of the way we usually think of say psychopharmacology drugs right which is that they create dependence and addiction you get off of them and your brain can do that anymore because it overrode the natural regulatory system this is one of our [2253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2253.43s)

primary design principles is that we want to understand what the brain's own regulatory process and the body's regulatory process is doing and support it rather than override it in a way that whenever someone stops with that particular technology gee you have a net neutral - net positive lasting effect rather than a down-regulation independence i would say [2276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2276.859s)

good neural hacking in general should have that as one of its criteria with this particular one i don't think a study has been done yet on someone using it for a while and then stopping and seeing if they continue to get that elevation from baseline i wouldn't see it as much as it's trying to trick the brain as it is supporting it by adding energy right like if you're if there's [2300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2300.109s)

three people pushing a car and one more person comes along to push it just goes better because there is you know more force being added to what's already happening and so here the goal was as the brain is modulating its frequency and it's at the max amplitude that it can generate if we can just add energy so we're adding amplitude we're just going to increase the efficiency of its [2325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2325.46s)

process there's something very beautiful it does something very aikido about not we know what the brain should be doing better and we're going to try and induce this specific frequency of delta but we actually don't know why it is moving between the frequencies exactly the way that it does but we're gonna kind of trust it and follow it and just add resource i think stem cells is another way that you can think about that right did you think about stem cell therapy we don't know how the stem cells differentiate into tissues fully and then all the metabolic functions of those cells do but we're simply adding resource to the system in general i think the approach to support the system's own regulatory processes doing what they do better as [2369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2369.8s)

opposed to trying to override them is a is a key distinction and how we should approach tech interface with the body interesting and so when it comes to supplements is this also your approach that you're trying to support what the body's already doing rather than kind of installing a new program oh this is how you're gonna do it body okay yeah of course so you know like with the [2396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2396.5s)

supplements that we've developed and more that we're in process of developing so let's take quality as an example it's a nootropic product cognitive enhancement product that we made because there's a good example here so some of the ingredients are actually just nutrients right they're nutrients that you should get in food and if you're eating a [2416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2416.27s)

healthy diet you'll be getting more of them than not but their nutrients that either are very commonly deficient even in good diets for a number of reasons so certain trace minerals that are important for brain function they're just deficient in soil even organic soil is still very different than before the soil originally went through a bunch of mono cropping and plants can't make [2440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2440.21s)

minerals right they're gonna pull up the minerals that are in the soil similarly if the soil is deficient in microbiota it's gonna affect the plant chemistry if the plants been hybridized so if there are common deficiencies in certain nutrients that are necessary for cognitive capacity or sleep or something like that making sure that there's enough of them that's just augmenting [2463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2463.61s)

eating and that doesn't mean that you can then eat poorly right so i use the word supplement right is that it is to supplement to be in addition to because what someone takes a few grams of and pills compared to what they're taking like pounds up and food there's no way that that's going to replace the primary effect but it can meaningfully add to it but also it just like if someone is [2486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2486.5s)

going to be using some function a lot more in an [[evolutionary environment]] would have had them use that function right so if letta cailli someone's gonna be sweating a lot more they're going to lose electrolytes faster so we give them electrolytes and actually makes a difference where they're going to be using branched chain amino acids to build skeletal muscle more of they're [2508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2508.73s)

tearing down skeletal muscle so we supplement brain shame yes there are nutrients that get used faster when someone is in certain kinds of cognitive process so if they want to spend a lot of time and peak cognitive process they're gonna burn through those quicker so you want to supplement them its brain nutrients and that is just the body's gonna convert those so say the the amino [2526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2526.55s)

acids that can get converted to neurotransmitters the vitamins and minerals that are involved in the conversion process the body's going to convert them as it needs them but not going to have nutrition be a rate limiting factor so that's obviously working with endogenous pathway support there are other things where say we are looking at the acetylcholine pathway has [2550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2550.67s)

a lot to do with memory and learning and sensory motor function speed of neuronal communication so the body is producing acetylcholine it's moving across synapses it's getting received in the postsynaptic receptors we can give plants or chemicals that modulate that process but that modulate the process in a much more holistic way than say traditional psychopharmacological [2581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2581.84s)

proaches which is a single drug intervention that's going to affect one part right like adderall being a presynaptic dopamine agonist and then not necessarily looking at how that works within the whole dopamine cycle and how dopamine relates to norepinephrine and epinephrine and serotonin the rest of the whole rest of neurotransmission so we want to look at [2601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2601.19s)

if we're gonna affect another transmitter we want to look at the entire cycle of that transmitter we want to look at the cellular processes of the pre and post synaptic neuron and we want to look at all the other transmitters and signaling chemicals that it's in relationship with and make sure that we're actually supporting a holistic process right and so you've got to [2620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2620.6s)

factor if you're wanting to be able to run more acetylcholine to the system the body's ability to acetylate the choline so that you have enough acetyl group you have choline certain source of choline can go to the peripheral neuron or to the central [[nervous system]] so depending upon what you want to do you do that differently and then there are you know rate limiting cofactors like for that [2643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2643.79s)

one it happens to be b5 so you want to make sure that's not gonna be rate limiting but then the acetylcholine getting across the synapse you have enzymes that are breaking it down just like you have enzymes that are breaking down dopamine or serotonin so you know many of the pharmaceutical meds that affect transmitter levels are working by [2663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2663.7s)

modulating what's happening in the synaptic cleft right we have taken hibbett er so if some has genetically high mao levels or comt levels or acetylcholine esterase levels then they're going to be sub functional in that area and you can actually be able to you know to have a nutria genomic override to that and if you're gonna be producing more acetylcholine [2690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2690.14s)

and you wanted to get across the synapse so you're gonna you know help with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and then you actually want to get it up taken in the postsynaptic neuron right today the nmda receptors primarily there are things that you can use it will modulate that receptor if you support the entire cycle of how the body is actually producing you'll get a lot more [2711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2711.95s)

optimum results and you'll end up getting the body learning how to do that and being able to actually have plasticity effect right it's going to rewire to that state if it does that state a significant amount and then when someone gets off it they'll either have a little effect or lasting positive effects because they have rewired one of the bigger ways that you get lasting [2734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2734.119s)

effects is by actually working to change brain structure in a positive direction so this is things like can we help the brain develop more new neurons and increased gray matter density or in or develop more new synapses so it's called neurogenesis or synaptogenesis so we get more densely interconnected brain structures and there do happen to be a lot of things that are known about [2760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2760.64s)

specific nutrients and specific chemicals that do support the brains natural process of neurogenesis happening more robustly or the brains process of naruto a killing old senescent brain cells that cause problems and allowing new ones to you know proliferate and so these are these are examples of ways you could get lasting benefit after you know from a [2782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2782.66s)

biochemical solution after stopping taking the biochemical solution because it's actually seeking to one just tune the system better and to rewire to enough regulated state and three actually support the development of new structures this is really interesting i wanted to rewind slide to where you're talking about neurotransmitters that regulate mood [2806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2806.27s)

because there's a huge industry of selling drugs that regulate mood that actually have adverse long-term effects if you stop taking them or if you continue taking them they kind of lose their effectiveness in a way over time and for example i have experience taking ssris and i had both of those effects with withdrawal after coming off of them and and decreasing effectiveness over [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2834.86s)

time but what you're talking about is that it's actually possible to have supplements or drugs that have net positive effects over time even if you stop taking them can you talk about that a bit specifically when it comes to mood regulation yeah so let me say that the the ideal way to approach this is a personalized medicine or personalized well-being approach because so say the [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2862.37s)

ssri did something good for you for a while but then it had side effects and it had down regulation and you adapted to it did it do some good for you because you actually had a dysbiosis issue in your gut where you just were not producing half of the serotonin that you need that's an important question right because if so i wouldn't even want to give you brain supplements i want to [2887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2887.57s)

fix your gut or was there actually something where your diet was deficient in tryptophan and so the raw amino acid necessary to make serotonin was low and we just actually had to address your diet right or so there's so many things that can be involved and we can say in general if someone takes 5htp which is 5-hydroxytryptophan hydroxylated tryptophan that's just one conversion [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2920.42s)

step away from 5-hydroxytryptamine to serotonin and they take the phosphorylated version of b6 p5p that it converts the h5 http to serotonin that they're much since that's just the stuff that is one step away from serotonin the body be working with any ways that they're less likely to get dependence and down-regulation from just having enough [2944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2944.75s)

of those things than they would from an ssri that's true and and ideally i would find out what's going on first because we also see so many people who they get on an ssri and then they get much worse right so many of the shooting cases that we've seen were after someone was put on an ssri who hadn't been on it before and the suicidal homicidal tendencies are true because if someone is more dopamine [2971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2971.09s)

deficient in their depression and they really needed something like wellbutrin instead like this is what's so crazy to me is we don't even do any kind of testing to see that the neurochemical imbalance before we give them chemistry rather than psychology and then to the degree that there even is a neurochemical amounts we don't know which one or which ones and then to the [2992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=2992.6s)

degree that we even knew which one we don't know why it's off and the answer is just straight to a drug yeah that's just crazy it is and think about this so your brain is as complex a system as we know of existing in universe right and you've got the the number of neurons and of glial cells and the number of synaptic connections and the number metabolic processes per individual one [3022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3022.27s)

and the feedback and feed-forward processes is just completely mind-boggling so when you think about something like serotonin right that is a it's a signaling molecule that's the end of many steps of metabolic transform so if it's low how likely is it that other things are low or high or dysregulated or there's something else off like it's pretty high right when we just go [3047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3047.14s)

straight to let's get more serotonin right let's keep it from you know reuptake and because we have to you know in the drug the drug industry has to use synthetic single molecules to be able to get them patented which is the only way that they could ever make enough money to go through fda trials and that's fda but every country has you some version but i think us probably [3072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3072.64s)

leads the way in some of both the good and bad aspects of this what's the chance that a single synthetic molecule meaning it's not part of your natural landscape at all and it's just one molecule could ever be an adequate solution to a complex chemistry dysregulation in a self-organizing system like your brain like it just doesn't even make sense right it doesn't [3096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3096.46s)

make sense that that could possibly be the thing that's really gonna repair it yeah so it's usually gonna be not one molecule that's off but lots of them and so then we have to from maybe lots of different processes so how do we identify what's going on and support the system's increasing its own internal resilience i mean this same is like when you talk about cognitive chemistry this [3120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3120.67s)

cognitive chemistry mediated via dopamine or via acetylcholine or glutamate or sodium ion channels or long-term potentiation or all those things right complex interactions and lots of those things and so one of the key things is that when you're wanting to work with a [[complex system]] like a brain you've really got to have a more complexity informed approach than single [3140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3140.5s)

molecule interventions mm-hmm so you're saying we're mostly involved in this single molecule interventions because that's what's profitable it's not just that's what's profitable that's the only thing that you can because it's profitable it's only thing you can even afford to do research on right you know when you hear things like well there are not so many good scientific trials done [3163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3163.3s)

on herbs who the would pay for them i mean you'll see little trials done on herbs but it costs a billion dollars give or take to take a drug through fda approval well who's gonna put in a billion dollars and then when you take the drug through you're not even sure that it's gonna work in the market and then you have a class-action lawsuit at the end [3181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3181.87s)

like you've got to have a twenty billion dollar potential on that for it to make any sense to even embark on right so of course you've got to have a patent on it and so if you have something that's not patentable and even in the drug space there are certain drugs that got published about in a way that makes them unpatentable and even though they're super promising they just don't get [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3200.86s)

developed because who would develop right because if it's not a synthetic chemical if it's already available in nature they probably can't patent it for example in my case i've been using peganum harmala seeds for mood regulation and i've had really excellent effects with them much much better than i ever had with ssris also combined with meditation and diet [3224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3224.11s)

adjustments but you know if something like that was patented as a mood regulation supplement if they probably couldn't patent it well no they they definitely can't patent it but even some synthetics can't get patented because you know the information was already released and so now it's part of the commons or after the patent life on a drug expires and so now it's not really [3249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3249.55s)

profitable because the generics are all going to be really cheap then we need to before a drug company look for a new thing in that space even if the new things are not better or even shittier than the previous thing simply because we just can't make money doing that so what are the ways around it supplements don't have to go through fda approval think about from pharmaceutical industry [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3271.6s)

what it means to invest something like a billion dollars of capital before you've made your first dollar back right like that's so far from silicon valley software tech thinking that's a lot of money to invest before you know actually having any revenue but yeah so supplements they don't have to do that but they can't claim that they have any medical purpose or heal anything so then [3298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3298.51s)

that becomes the tricky thing if they want to claim it they have to go through fda process if they're gonna go through fda process that's super expensive and they're gonna have to have a profit stream to be able to justify it so that's the deal basically to really fix that the entire regulatory financial and intellectual property structures have to be changed and realistically i can say [3318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3318.76s)

for-profit medicine is a broken system because when you have a for-profit sick care system where people come in ill pharmaceuticals or hospitals or insurance or anybody you know any money that's going to be made in the two trillion dollar complex of health care is only made when people are sick so prevention would just obsolete that entire profit stream right and so then [3345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3345.25s)

you start thinking about patients as customers and every mba first thing they learn is how do you maximize the lifetime value of a customer and that should never apply to a patient right theory of markets the free market should apply to things that one can choose in to choose out of you can't reasonably choose out of health care and so it should not be structured in the [3373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3373.089s)

for-profit way that it is any more than for-profit prisons should be yeah you're optimizing for what you don't want exactly you know as i was talking to a group that was working on peace and reconciliation the other day and i asked them what's the chance of having the world free from war or any militarized conflict while having a for-profit military-industrial complex lastingly [3396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3396.82s)

and they realized that supply and demand theory says zero percent chance that those two could coexist in during lee right because if there isn't demand for that supply it'll shut down and stop existing will be a for-profit complex or it will have to do supply-side economics and create demand and so that means that you have the largest block of economics have its own survival antithetical to [3426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3426.359s)

global peace that's that's a up structure for humanity and for-profit prisons are the same and for-profit health care is the same when you start going through you see how many places the financial incentive the [[game theory]] is exactly opposite to what the collective goal should be so like what it takes to really fix medicine and health care and well-being care etc the [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3454.05s)

ip has to change where we're not focused on patentable things and then separate patents that can't be combined because different ip holders have them and only unnatural things etc but the whole ip process is broken and it needs to move to maximum innovation ownership restriction the financial models have to change where all the financial incentive is aligned with what [3478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3478.0s)

we actually want which is optimized collective well-being not otherwise and that doesn't look like any fiscal health care system we've had and the scientific model has to change rather than a you know small number of variable reductionist approach to understanding a complex self-organizing system we have to actually get better at [[complexity science]] and understanding the body as a regulatory system the body mind complex regulatory system what causes regulatory breakdown and how to support increased regulatory capacity of the system rather than just overriding it all the time right it's a whole different set of incentives it's a different kind of science it's different incentives and it's different legal structures and so yes there's a lot of [3527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3527.32s)

things that we want to evolve in diagnostic medicine and therapeutic medicine and ai interpretation and you know but deeper than all that are these meta structures that need to evolve so going back to the kind of specific approaches that you are taking how are you building these meta structures in a different way than they currently exist [3548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3548.71s)

yeah so we're obviously within the within the confines of those meta structures to begin with so we're our first products are supplements the reason why we chose to do supplements is to be able to bring things direct to consumer that's what it's going to be called rather than to go through fda process and a doctor process and specifically since we're working with [3572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3572.04s)

some synthetics but largely you know synthetics and natural compounds both so a lot of unpatentable things and combinations of them and you know moving towards customizable combinations it's outside of patentability so for all those reasons that made sense and because we wanted to be able to control the integrity of the company we wanted to take on very little capital and only [3594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3594.79s)

very values align capital and so we wanted to build things that we could actually build ourselves first to then be able to grow the company and continues for like friends the first product we brought to market quality our cogs on their right just our cost of goods is higher than the retail costs of most other cognitive enhancers on the market and all the investors [3617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3617.619s)

looked at well you got to get the cogs down and like there is no way to get it down until we get to huge economies of scale and vert and owning our own [[supply chain]] without cutting quality because i run a bunch of additional steps of testing to make sure that there's you know optimized purity and potency and that no mycotoxin or whatever got into the supply and manufacturing and use [3640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3640.479s)

forms that are more expensive forms of all the ingredients and you know amounts that are actually meaningful which is expensive so part of it is when you're working within those structures knowing what your mission is very clearly so your mission is not delivering returns to shareholders first it's actually delivering meaningful technology to enrich people's lives and if you don't [3663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3663.009s)

have something that they'll do that you just don't do it that's a really key first part of it right and then being able to grow while maintaining control of that mission is a key part of it how else we working with those meta structures well we open-source our information so as far as ip we just don't believe in it so rather than say we have a proprietary blend of this [3689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3689.92s)

number of milligrams of things we just have the exact number of milligrams of the exact sources and all the sourcing info so if anyone wants to just go buy the raw ingredients make it themselves they're welcome to if someone wants to try and make a better formula they can because we just want to support the field advancing for optimized human wellbeing as best as possible and so [3709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3709.779s)

that's we we have a strong open-source take on everything ip and then reinvesting our capital in developing new technologies and really focusing on not where is the highest profit margin technology but what are the technologies that will really make the biggest difference in addressing the things that cause most suffering that are the least well addressed currently all right on [3733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrozCypcUx4&t=3733.66s)
