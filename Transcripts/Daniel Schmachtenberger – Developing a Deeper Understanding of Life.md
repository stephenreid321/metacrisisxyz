foreign music society spirit i'm roger walsh and our co-host is john dupuis and with us today is a guest that i'm just delighted to be in dialogue with this is daniel schmachtenberger one of the most incisive integrative and brilliant thinkers about the great issues of our time daniel's a polymath who has ranged [32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=32.719s)

across a wide variety of disciplines and has a prodigious amount of information about multiple areas topics issues concerns and and intellectual disciplines but not only a wide array of information a remarkable degree of infamous information and integration pulling topics together synthesizing them in novel ways and coming up with creative innovations and ideas and [61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=61.52s)

syntheses he is able to even has been giving us a wide array of insights into the great issues of our time and if you've searched the internet you have to probably run across daniel and the many dialogues he's had about the [[metacrisis]] the term that's currently used for our the sum total of our social and global issues but what you haven't seen or heard of daniel is his spiritual dimensions and the ways in which those have touched his understanding of life and and our current temporary concerns so we were really delighted given that deep transformation is about transformation not only of self and society but also with spirit william daniel suggested that in our discussion of them had a [115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=115.439s)

crisis we focus specifically on these spiritual dimensions which he said he doesn't often get a chance to talk about and so we are just very happy to have this opportunity and daniel you know so many people know you uh someone as a brilliant intellectual who has thought deep and hard and and synthetically novely about these great issues but you also have a deep commitment to [142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=142.739s)

self-exploration self-actualization spiritual practice what would you like to share about that side of yourself first thanks for having me here it's good to be with you both in all the people engaging in the podcast um when it comes to the spiritual dimensions and we'll we'll [173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=173.7s)

probably want to unpack what we even mean by spiritual sunset is a pretty um unprecise term often but the the psychological interior sacred whatever dimensions of uh the state of our world a would love to be in that conversation together i don't have a preset set of things to talk about on it because as [201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=201.42s)

you mentioned it's not the thing i talk about all the time but uh obviously very interesting um i was fortunate in my growing up to get to study a lot of the people that might be called great polymaths throughout history so i have a heap of respect for them and i've tried to learn what i can i [224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=224.22s)

would not describe myself that way um i think the connection as i would describe myself as being deeply interested in lots of things and i find that what people are interested in and what they find meaningful and at the heart of that what they find [245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=245.519s)

sacred are usually connected though they might not be explicitly aware and the things that people are interested in and enough they often develop some capacity at and if someone has some sense of the wholeness of reality as opposed to like when we think in different disciplines here's where biology starts in chemistry [269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=269.1s)

stops or physics or whatever um i those are ways we take the complexity of the world and try to divide it to make subjects and make it easier to study but those divisions don't exist in reality in that way so if we have some sense of just the integrated wholeness of reality and we're kind of interested in it there's [290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=290.88s)

some sense that reality itself is sacred then there would be nothing that isn't interesting right it's like if it's like what if you're really in love with your partner what aspect of their being is uninteresting to you like it's a weird proposition to say item give a what she thinks about or like her talk books on fashion [310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=310.86s)

or whatever it is and it's such a superficial place to be because even if you didn't think you cared about that topic on your own if you really care about this peeing and this being cares about it work to understand why they care about it because there's some part of their being you're missing if the fascination they have if the care if the love doesn't [330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=330.9s)

translate to and so if you get that you're like well whatever every aspect of them i'm interested in because part of love is the desire to know because what does it mean that i love somebody if i don't really know who they are um and if i have some love for reality then wanting to know it more is one of the [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=352.5s)

things right wanting to appreciate it more wanting to being more service to it and those are all just kind of natural byproducts and so um relatively young i had the insight that everything was interesting that the things that i thought weren't interesting because at first i didn't [375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=375.36s)

think that but the the things i thought weren't interesting was just because i didn't get them i didn't understand why uh anyone else found it interesting and if i tuned in empathetically enough to them and i could see it i'm like oh there's a whole dimension of meaningfulness and beauty in parts of the nature of reality that i'm just missing and when jibron said it's in it was in meditation upon the dewdrop that i discovered the mysteries of the ocean right the kind of poetic way to speak to the the fractal nature or the as without so then when there is some understanding of the integratedness of reality a deep insight about anything also gives you some insight about everything else and uh one [419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=419.34s)

of the places that i gained the most insight was taking some principle and thermodynamics and applying it to gardening or some principle in evolutionary theory and applying it to relationships or whatever getting that like those theories were ways of understanding the universe but all of them gave different insights looking at [439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=439.8s)

the world through thermodynamics lens versus an evolutionary cyclins versus a complexity theory lens gave different insights on the same reality so if i could take those insights and apply them to lots of things and apply lots of different ones just got to see more multi-dimensionally right one of the projects we launched called the consilience project that's what the word [457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=457.919s)

consilience means is the more perspectives one can take on a thing the more depth and richness of information they can get about it um so and i think you know the the [[metacrisis]] this area of study of like what are all the problems of the world is really like came from a childhood inquiry of [480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=480.12s)

um what is worth doing and uh there were so many things that were worth doing and i became i became kind of clear that when you focus on one one i just couldn't leave some of the areas out right like it was just i don't know how many people have this experience some [501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=501.12s)

for sure but when i would think about really focusing on [[factory farm|factory farms]] or really focusing on um the issue of how many dogs and cats are getting put to sleep every year or clear cutting or whatever it was the idea that i was not focusing on the other things just wrecked me [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=518.7s)

and then getting to see that there were so many groups focusing on those things and yet so many of those things collectively were getting worse not better and i was wondering do we just need more effort in these areas or is there something about the nature of the effort that is that is um off and the answer is both but there was [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=537.06s)

definitely something about and people heard me talk other places the way we solve problems causes other problems almost all the time because we define the problem too narrowly we create a first order solution that's a technology or a law or a business or whatever to solve it but that's connected to a complex set of things and it produces second and third [554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=554.7s)

order effects somewhere else so the dam to bring electricity to poor people to solve the poverty issue might extinct a bunch of species down river from the dam that just got flooded or whatever and this a million examples of this so there's a it actually became clear that the study of the issues in the world and the siloing of the issues in the world was a part of the problem itself why we weren't solving them in a way that boehm talked about very well david bohm and uh so the like what is worth caring about everything and how it fits together what is worth studying is kind of everything the study is for itself it's pure knowledge of just the intimacy [598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=598.2s)

with universes intrinsically interesting and it's also has utility it can increase the capacity to be of service to um those are some initial thoughts but daniel did you was there a point as a young man or a teenager you begin as you were kind of chewing on all this and seeing it was that starting to emerge as [619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=619.44s)

a calling for you that maybe that was your uh path to start connecting the dots and seeing how these things uh mattered i think i think most people when they're young are enculturated in a particular way about who they are and what life is about and what they should pursue and then some of them continue on that [649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=649.56s)

path some of them recognize that their parents idea of what their calling should be or their culture's idea is not their own and then they have kind of this path change um i've had i've had lots of path refinements i i have had um times of [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=671.64s)

deep study and esoteric metaphysics and hardcore reductionist atheism you know like like any young person who's trying to be intellectually congruent and make sense of stuff and not miss stuff and but but they had the same spirit to them which is funny right they had the same spirit which was like and you can't even put words to it because you can say it's what is true but it's also kind of what [694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=694.56s)

is good what is meaningful what is beautiful and you know something like that um but i think i was pretty fortunate in a way that some other but not lots of other people were in terms of early childhood exposure to the topic of what is my path is that that's a i had parents that were [713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=713.339s)

putting that question as the forefront of my education since i was born and so that's a pretty fortunate thing and um i went to school a few times mostly to my parents were interested in me getting some socialization but i was mostly homeschooled and they were interested in running a kind of educational experiment and they [739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=739.38s)

were they were not educational philosophers in any formally trained sense they hadn't read dewey and montessori and steiner they just had their own kind of intuitions about it but some really good intuitions but the sense was rather than have a curriculum based thing have some sense of trust the kids innate curiosities if facilitated [759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=759.72s)

will orient them in the right direction so it's kind of constructivist and so we had a homeschool that had no curriculum at all and there are a few places where this was significantly disadvantageous because like it wasn't until i was an adult and paying attention to spell checker that i learned how to spell [779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=779.399s)

um it's very fortunate i didn't do enough of the like writing letters penmanship to actually have refine the fine motor skills enough to have legible handwriting um i didn't get it and then let it devolve because of busyness like some doctors i just never even got to decent penmanship it was a good thing i can type um there were whole areas of like american history and things that were actually important that i just didn't know were important i just had none of them but then there were some areas that i got to study way more deeply than people normally would have at those times but because i was studying things i was interested in i doubled down on interest right and i [815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=815.04s)

think one of the things that happens for a kid is when you don't facilitate their interests because you don't know how which so often the kids are asking questions and the parents just don't know the answers hey i give these examples a lot because they come up all the time when a kid asks why is the sky blue or why is fire hot you have to understand many layers [835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=835.38s)

of physics but then also neuroscience and then also the philosophy of mind to be able to translate the [[subjective experience]] of hotness from sensations that happen on the skin and what is communicated between cells and in the [[nervous system]] to what is the thermodynamics of fire or the nature of the molecules in the upper atmosphere that create blueness in the [859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=859.8s)

visual optical spectrum those questions if every kid asks stuff like that and if you know how to facilitate the interest they end up learning everything from theory of mind too uh philosophy of science to um you know atmospherics and neurobiology but if you don't facilitate the things they're interested in and you force them [880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=880.5s)

to do that they're not interested in it can break their interest and then they become a little bit more focused on quick hits of dopamineergic interest rather than deep learning so i had that fortune but the other fortune other than just kind of designing my own curriculum is because a kid will largely be interested in things based on what they're exposed to and how [902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=902.339s)

they're exposed i don't find that there are any kids who aren't interested in math who had amazing math teachers or who weren't interested in art who had amazing art teachers or history so how they're what they're exposed to and so what my parents were interested in had a lot to do with what i was interested in of course right this is one of the [920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=920.22s)

limits of constructivism is you know what the reality of what the kid is exposed to but again i feel like i lucked out in terms of their interest being things were a pretty good set of things so my my parents were reading buckminster fuller and kind of design science and they were reading david bowman krishnamurti they [938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=938.16s)

were reading kind of vedanta and eastern philosophy for chuff capra and the kind of emerging systems theory in the early 80s and uh and they also the thought that there's no reason bedtime kids bedtime stories for kids when their infants need to be dr seuss as opposed to synergetics by bucky fuller because because learning language no matter what and so those [960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=960.3s)

were like my primitive concepts and included in those were the core existential questions of what are we what are we here for what is this all about and then the people using kind of the most advanced frameworks of the time like systems theory and design science to think about how do we go about making a better world and like that so i never really had to find my way to that that [983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=983.579s)

was kind of the default setting i had to find and upon further inquiry of like was that a wrong default setting should i just um just make money or make art or something else like no that didn't that ended up continuing to be roughly right direction um but trying to more competently answer how to understand the issues of the [1009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1009.98s)

world and how to be of service to them there's a lot of content refinement and daniel so you had a an unusually broad self-directed education but there's also something else that's quite distinctive about your thinking and that is a rare degree of integration and how did how did you develop that i have friends who are developmental theorists uh who [1041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1041.6s)

zach stein who i work with closely and many others who we'll talk about how there's an increase in the type of um complexity of what someone can process the way they notice changes in context for processing the same content the way they can seek and shift perspectives and then integrate them and i think there's [1064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1064.7s)

a lot true and important there have other friends who are critics of developmental theory because they say there's a lot of societal normative assumptions based on how people are kind of ubiquitously trained that in a different society with different childhood development would go differently um so for instance [1082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1082.7s)

if kids are being taught in school this is math this is social studies this is history this is biology and they're being taught a compartmentalized universe where they're never asked how the social science is being influenced by the biology or vice versa or how the principles co apply they're getting a non-integrated [1103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1103.12s)

fragmented world given to them and actually behaviorally trained up on thinking that way they're not being given any kind of integrated framework so then we get excited when someone becomes an integrative thinker later because it was trained out of everybody um uh i don't think it is actually necessary that people learn that way i [1122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1122.0s)

think it's not even the case in say um pre-industrialized education it was just wasn't even the case in the same way um and so because my education was self-directed it also didn't have clear delineations of topics i was never doing math or social studies i was doing an inquiry about something that was [1147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1147.98s)

interesting that might have involved some math and some you know quite a few things so if you're trying to understand integrative things like how does a body cell organize how does a fetus actually develop how does that then you're having to intrinsically be radically interdisciplinary um what is worth doing in the world and [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1169.52s)

how do we know and um so i think the most interesting questions are at a high enough level of abstraction to address them well there's the taxonomy of questions beneath them is very interdisciplinary and you actually have to bridge across them so i do think um a totally different educational paradigm could have [1191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1191.62s)

uh analysis and synthesis or integration on and all that said happening simultaneously at each level of complexity yeah and underneath pulling together uh some of the things you've said you've spoken to your education you've spoken to the to the natural uh integrative thinking that emerges from a problem-solving [1215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1215.48s)

approach to education as opposed to a compartmentalized uh scholastic disciplinary approach but i also underlying that this was uh sounds like a a real a desire for an appreciation of the whole and a desire to optimize service and it seems like what i'm hearing is that those two things led you to this in big picture integrative approach to understanding and responding [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1248.0s)

to the great issues of our time yeah i'll share a few other things that i think were significant influences that i'm grateful for and that i think are interesting for everybody to to look at is um i think there's a good bit of evidence that the people that many of us find to be some of the most great the greatest exemplars [1274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1274.7s)

of human potential were the result of developmental paths that are more accessible to everyone than lots of people are think um not just some weird um genetic or situational anomaly um and i'm not saying that genetics plays no role in aptitude of course it does the height is a real thing that's going to [1297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1297.559s)

affect aptitude size whatever and maybe does it do that for neural connectivity sure um but uh i believe his name is eric hole who is a an academic who started a very interesting vlog recently um published this article that then has gotten a lot of traction and debate [1320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1320.9s)

around where of all the super genius is gone and it's a resource i think is really interesting and worth people paying attention to of course their problems with what we think of as super genius because my aboriginal tracker who doesn't solve rubik's cubes particularly well or do the normal iq things be a super genius in a totally different set [1340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1340.52s)

of dimensions on things we can't even perceive whether normal cognitive um uh cognitive science kind of models sure but if we just take what his meaning here who is saying it seems that the uh isaac newtons and einstein's and uh you know the the people that contributed [1366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1366.14s)

novel insights to many fields that specialists in those fields appreciated and hadn't done that we are seeing less of that recently than we have in a long time and there's this whole fascinating debate i know i'm a bit off topic but i find this an interesting topic it may be relevant um some people think the idea that there is less super genius now is just wrong [1387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1387.5s)

and some kind of romantic romanticizing the past but there's pretty meaningful data in here in terms of how quickly do new scientific insights happen or philosophic insights where legal insights happen that are paradigm shifting that would change a cooney in paradigm or something like that some people think it's that there's just so much more knowledge now than [1408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1408.02s)

there was you just can't be a polymath that you could have been a polymath before and know all the stuff and just nobody can now that it takes all of your life to be a specialist in a tiny discipline and the only thing that can make breakthroughs now is huge teams of specialist scientists with big data processing ais um there's a lot of different ideas [1425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1425.78s)

about it find men famously said that he thought he would be in the last generation of great physicists for some time based on what he saw happening in the direction of physics and the direction of education and uh there have certainly been some developments in physics since but maybe not of the type from modern physics to him [1446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1446.179s)

um i think there is some truth in this that has that we are actually developing people of that type less globally independent of the increasing complexity of the world is also a factor i think there's a few reasons for it but one of them that seems to be pretty compelling and so this uh this article about where the super [1468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1468.98s)

genius is gone puts forth that there is a lot of data that points to the idea that most of the great polymaths the super geniuses if you want to call in were have one thing really clearly in common obviously not 100 correlation but a higher correlation than anything else which was that they were the result of aristocratic tutoring high quality aristocratic tutoring and that host the kind of modernity and democratic reformation of the world there was no aristocratic tutoring of the same kind and that it really makes a difference so if you think about it this little boy in tibet identifies certain bowls and pains so we say he's the dalai lama of marinecarnation perspective but then how does he get [1514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1514.7s)

educated right yeah right the top llamas in tibet who are the top meditators and oracles and philosophers and historians and scholars and mathematicians are all privately training this boy the investment of their entire culture is the dalai lama the result of an educational paradigm that doesn't really scale because how could you have the best teachers of a whole peoples you [1537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1537.559s)

know for everybody and is the dalai lama's type of consciousness and capacity actually something that could be trained if people had access to that it's a fair question when you read meditations by marcus aurelius which is also a great philosophic text the first chapter he dedicates just to his tutors right the entire like he writes the book of stoic [1560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1560.84s)

philosophy as the emperor of rome in the first chapter is just a dedication to his tutors because when you're being raised to be the emperor of rome during rome's high period the best mathematician in all of rome is your math teacher and the best historian and there was another study i had seen i i find this theory of education stuff so deeply fascinating there's a study i'd [1580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1580.7s)

seen that was looking at um world class or what were considered first-rate mathematicians and they had some way of defining what a first-rate mathematician was and it wasn't just a field's medal it was something uh some set of things but the highest statistical correlator they could find across everyone who became a first-rate mathematician to see [1601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1601.22s)

like is there some trait that where we can predict this is that when they were young they started to study with a first-rate mathematician and of course someone could do a correlation causation question and say was it only because they had such exceptional ability that a first mathematician paid attention to them when they were young but it does not [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1620.659s)

appear that that is the direction of causation that they got exposed to a fur trade mathematician was teaching at their particular school for a while at the time whatever because there are certain classes where a whole bunch of them came out of that class where that teacher was and it makes sense because your average first grade or 12th grade math teacher at a high school is not a [1639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1639.32s)

first-rate mathematician they're not even a second or third rate mathematician the the brilliance of mathematical thinking the love of it the insight the passion they don't have it they have something else right they study to be an educator they studied in a country that couldn't pay you all that much to be an educator so they aren't even a first-rate educator [1656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1656.96s)

so can you learn how to think like a first-rate mathematician from a normal math teacher who is themselves someone who has never even had salt like that probably not and the same would be true for spiritual insight or for anything else and um so when you look at marcus aurelius you're like is was who he was actually just the result of a good educational [1677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1677.9s)

model and um when the modern democracies were forming the idea of feudalism was so disgusting and repugnant for many reasons and had to be shed away that anything that was a remnant of feudalism had to be put away but in democratizing education to raise higher education for so many people you also lowered the highest [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1698.419s)

version of education to where the wealthy people whose kids are getting tutoring today is to keep up with the normal scholastics of a curriculum-based thing it's not a personalized tutoring system for the most part and um so i do partly why i was bringing this up is that um you know i didn't have a whole field of [1720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1720.799s)

tutors but i had parents that were doing that with me and then because i saw how valuable it was to have invested people be in that level of dialogue i started seeking out tutors before i even knew this and this is like maybe the highest thing i can recommend to young people or for parents what to do with their kids i i somehow knew because i also had stuff [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1744.38s)

like think and grow rich and the kind of like tenacity of a carnegie to be self-directed is part of the thing but hopefully along a different set of goals than just monetary accumulation but if you have the tenacity of a carnegie associated with other developmental goals which would be a really good thing um whenever i found a teacher that seemed [1763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1763.46s)

like they knew something i really wanted to learn i figured out what i could possibly do to be useful to them and that looked like cleaning their house and changing babies diapers and learning skills i didn't have they needed electrical done i would learn electrical so it's like whatever the it is this is who i want to study from so i'm going to figure out how to be around [1782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1782.0s)

them and be useful to them and so much of my learning was not what i studied in university that was cool or even just in books on my own it was people who were really really brilliant spending time with me directly because i figured out how to and partly i was a gift and partly i figured out how to make that happen and daniel is part of what you're saying as far as the [1803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1803.12s)

tutor also a mentor relationship having older people that could not only just download information but somehow impact your soul and your being and you know it's all together see in a mentoring relationship they're not just topical autists right they're who have because they're teaching to a whole class have to teach a curriculum you're the kid is asking [1826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1826.399s)

them questions that they're interested in that range beyond their subject matter and the and the teacher in that relationship actually cares about them and loves them and gets invested in their education so they end up getting the benefit of something like good parenting but multiplied by a lot more people with a lot more capacities that error correct each other [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1845.24s)

and so the cognitive education shouldn't be limited to one domain separate from others it should go across the domains but it shouldn't be limited to just cognitive education it should be that the you know and so first the various domains of ontology need integrated you need to be able to think about biology and chemistry and physics and etc together next is you have to integrate [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1868.159s)

across ontology and epistemology whenever the kid is learning something it's not just here is how it works it's why does it work that way how is that discovered that this is one of the next key insights is i never wanted to know a formula in math i wanted to know how long people knew that that problem was interesting and didn't have the formula [1888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1888.799s)

who discovered it first what novel thing about their life gave them that insight what other new things they discovered afterwards because of that you know like i wanted to know the epistemology um and i find that when you get that and you start to get what is the [[generator function]] of novel insight what is across all the domains the the people who discovered the most important thing what [1910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1910.64s)

was happening in them that made them discover the most important thing you can start to develop that in yourself rather than just a huge knowledge said in which case we're just shitty computers and so you want to integrate all the ontologies you want to integrate anthology and epistemology and then all of that in the cognitive domain you want [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1926.779s)

to integrate to why do you care at all why do you care to want to learn so the ethics the aesthetics the pragmatics also come in and the identity of the person in relationship to it comes in and and is there a developmental sense of responsibility that's transmitted it's like i don't want to let my dad down my mom down these people that taught me i want to live up to the the [1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1948.559s)

quality of the love and the gifts and the knowledge that they're imparting to me you know um people being motivated to care about people and animals and life forms that they will never meet and will never give them credit i could take some work it takes some [1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=1978.32s)

developmental work to get there enough that you'll make real sacrifices to care where you don't get any obvious credit for that it takes having some sense of um your identity expanded beyond your own individual self where you're looking through their eyes right and you're and you get that they actually matter to reality but at first if somebody believes in a sky god that is all knowing all seeing and internal punishment if you up and they know your thoughts so you can't just virtue signal because you can't virtue signal but god that knows it and eternal reward if you get it right so even if you're really just a [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2021.1s)

who just doesn't want to get punished and wants to get a reward you still have to be good all the way down to the level of your thoughts that's kind of awesome right like from the point of view of just how do you get a lot of people who might still be narcissists in a low degree of truly ethical development to do the right thing that kind of like sky god judicial system is kind of awesome [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2039.159s)

and another and now it's also terrible because then of course everybody's terrified of burning in hell forever and has to think that someone else who's not getting it right is and they have to terrify their kids at burning in hell um but in the same way the idea that many many traditions had that when i die i'm going to be with the ancestors and uh [2061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2061.839s)

i'm going to like end there are some glory of my of the great teachers and will and they're still watching me right and and when i go to be with my forefathers with the teachers um in eternity and afterlife do i actually deserve to be with them there's something in nobles that that can do right there's something powerfully [2085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2085.659s)

ennobling that that old tradition can do of course we also find out that our great teachers are people that have their failings and weaknesses and we have to wrestle with that and we're going to have our own feelings and weaknesses and we might get intellectually congruent enough to have some doubts on the metaphysics of that thing but um there's there is definitely something even if you don't go to the metaphysics the afterlife version there is something about feeling that you received something that you don't get to take credit for that you're fortunate someone else was born into a situation that if you were born into you'd be doing less well and that [2120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2120.579s)

you were fortunate to get to have these experiences and that you owe something to them and to the future world because of that fortune i think that's really important anyway i've got to bring this up we're preparing for this i went through your websites and i came across a blog article you'd written things that i learned from my dad i was deeply moved by this a halfway through when we got to the part uh how to treat women i think i i started weeping and uh immediately i like your father but i like you because this is what you remembered from your father and it was so incredibly powerful and basic and i see such a a need for young men to be initiated into some [2171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2171.339s)

sort of positive manhood and what your father laid out i got a lot from my father but obviously he was not as articulate it's your dad he lived a lot of these principles you were talking about and can i read one of them um god i love this the highest value for men is serving women nature and children future generations [2197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2197.5s)

the highest value for men you should shout it from the rooftops that's incredibly profound yeah my dad would say things all the time like you're either serving your family or the family of mankind or you're off path those are the only two things you can be doing that are not off path and um the family of mankind was the term used but inclusive of life not just human life um yeah i mean i wrote that because my dad's health was very uh delicate at the time and it wasn't clear if he was going to be around much longer or not and so often people write a eulogy of all [2245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2245.02s)

the things that they appreciated from their parent after they're dead and they don't get to experience it directly and i thought that that would be a loss and so uh i wanted to write it for that reason but i also wanted to write it that particular one is definitely not a full expression of what i learned from my dad it was called things i learned about [2267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2267.52s)

being a man from my dad um and so it was it was definitely oriented to the principles that have to do with transfer of masculinity as opposed to just would be equally true for all people some of them are of course that and part of the reason that i wrote it at that time was i think i'd had [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2289.24s)

in conversations arise in the week or two before of men young men so boy into man phase who had just clearly never been fathered in important ways and were causing pain to women they were in relationships with to people around them were being poorer leaders and it was just um [2318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2318.579s)

i was like there are so many people that didn't have so many men that are in their masculine role not having the fortune of having had a good role model or good teaching in that way and i wonder if some tiny little bit of vicarious element of it can come through by writing about it so that's why i wrote that one in that way i think it came through for me brother thank you [2342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2342.4s)

for that um and one of the things he said is like on your time off what you do is you get in your pickup truck this was before cell phones and all and you drive around and find people are having trouble with their cars getting them started you fix their cars and send them on their way and he said that's a good time that's the way to spend your day off and it's [2361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2361.599s)

always orientation noble disinterested service and it's just i i anyway but it was so funny because yeah this was before cell phones and so when someone was broken down on the side of the road pulling over to pick them up was an important thing and um you know my i think part of teaching someone about how the world works in general [2384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2384.52s)

and also part of the ideas and i understand this is um normative like bigender normative thinking on the thing um that is how it was given to me uh was that for a boy growing into a man knowing how to solve problems and fix things those are particularly important thing so um anytime there was construction to do [2412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2412.42s)

he always involved me in it even where involving me and it took a lot more time than doing it without me because he was not just trying to fix the thing he was also trying to raise a child who would someday not just be an adult but would themselves be a parent and a teacher and how to do that thing properly and whenever there was something to fix on the car it took 10 times longer to show [2433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2433.96s)

me how to do it and you know then uh then not and so but then it was also well we're fixing the car there were so many things like if a job is worth doing it's worth doing well and well begun is half done and see the job do the job stay out of the misery these kind of idioms and the if a job is worth doing it's worth doing well meant [2455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2455.32s)

you just know half-assing the thing like we and so like i'll give you an example that was so beautiful i remember the first time we're building a building from the ground up we laid the studs and then we drilled through the studs to run the wire um for the outlets and it was very important to my dad that the way the [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2478.119s)

wiring was in the wall before the drywall went on was beautiful that the holes were at the same height that the romex was not twisted and that it was beautiful and no one would ever see it we're about to cover it in drywall and you're like why and he's like you know you know you know and it's an incredible and there's something where it's like [2502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2502.8s)

the if you can do it any of the ways do it the way that is the most integris the most awful the most beautiful and you will feel better about it and you'll feel better about who you are and then your unconscious default in the moments where it matters and other things will be to do the thing in the highest way you possibly can as opposed [2521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2521.44s)

to asking the corner credit questions and um so the if it's worth doing it's worth doing well see the job do the job stay out of the misery meant uh don't even ask if it's possible and definitely don't about it just if it needs done figure out how to do it and do it with the best attitude because you have choice over your attitude and [2543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2543.4s)

why would you do it any other way um and well begun is half done meant have you cleaned the space first have you set up the tools do you know what the workflow is going to be because the problems that are going to come up when you've opened everything up it's up on the jacks and you realize you're missing something you have to go to the store like that's where the danger happens [2561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2561.22s)

that's where someone gets hurt but for the inefficiency happens that's so think through the process pretty well first and anticipate where the mistakes and the problems and the challenges are going to happen there's so much of my work in the [[metacrisis]] that is anticipate where the unanticipated [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2577.66s)

externality is going to happen um and then internalize those future externalities into the choice making process better and uh yeah yeah like i can see now how you were basically uh self-taught and coached and mentored into uh into the ideals which would lead you into a life of service into a way of thinking which would bring you into a big picture approach and into a planning [2608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2608.5s)

mode that would allow you to anticipate second third order complications and to think through those to uh you were honed for the work you're doing now there's something that i was starting to say it's important please remember your thoughts because i don't want you to forget it but i don't want to forget this you were you had um mentioned john the [2637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2637.54s)

um that a fun time was to load up the tools and go looking for people who are broken down and fix up their car because aaa wouldn't say they come all the time especially if it was snowing outside they could actually be in danger um so obviously that meant you know they're i had to know some how to fix a car type skills so [2658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2658.359s)

i was mentioning that my dad would take a lot more time to do the thing than pay someone else to do it and to do it with me than do it on his own because he was wanting me to learn ing these other deeper psychological spiritual integrity lessons along with it like well begun is half done and if a job's worth doing it's worth doing well but then also learning the mechanical engineering of why was the screw threaded this way rather than the other way and why was the sting built this way and then the history of internal combustion engines and when the transmission came out and the um you know like and and then the physics of how the explosion happens inside of the [2699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2699.18s)

piston and so there's a very integrated set of knowledge that was happening and that takes just a lot of investment right it takes a lot of care and a lot of investment and but then when we would do that it was like sunday the other sun let's have fun um he wasn't into sports so we didn't throw a ball uh that's my my hand eye [2722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2722.92s)

coordination at the level of ball throwing didn't develop all that much but we would uh load the load the truck up with tools and go look for people who are broken down fix it up and the interesting thing was it didn't feel like some dreadful sacrifice of service that we had to do the way that a lot of people um feel when they're doing some church activity as kids they don't like if i like the most fun thing we could possibly do like it was just actually really enjoyable because one i'm getting this high quality time with my dad right he's not trying to get me to go do the thing on my own who were getting to be learning in the process and then [2762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2762.22s)

helping people where there's this immediate you know expression of these people being delighted and surprised and so there was absolutely it wasn't just like an ethic of service it was like uh like a way to condition that as that the what i want for myself personally and who i want to be for the world there wasn't even a distinction yeah beautiful yeah another thing your dad said not top apartment on your dad i could go on and on this but he said and this is so simple but so profound he said forgive just as a given you've got to forgive and the second part is help them do better so you just don't forgive okay i'm okay [2805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2805.72s)

i'm clear you know it doesn't bother anymore because i forgiven but the other part is help them do better i just think that's one of my when i was a kid and there's a period where my parents were uh in the tm community and um built this beautiful community called lakeview estates out in fairfield and we're working on um on a kind of enlightened theme park and [2830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2830.02s)

a development business and there was someone that was an extremely close friend of the family and um an employee and partner who had for whatever reasons um decided that uh he was going to come into our house and steal a bunch of [2852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2852.88s)

the artwork and uh because he you know had the key to the house and all like that and uh you know a betrayal like that oftentimes very easy to be like want to be vindictive or at least totally cut ties i remember my dad intercepting him not letting him do that and then taking him [2874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2874.48s)

out and having this conversation like dude what the like what happened inside your head is this who you want to be and there was still to like help them do better um and one of the ones that really stood out to me and you know i there's something where i [2892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2892.359s)

feel torn about this first just as a caveat i must say the reason i didn't write one about my mom at the time was because i don't think there is as gruesome a deficit of mothering in the world as there is fathering currently and so i didn't have as many women sharing with me just like kind of abject failures of fundamental things as i had [2914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2914.44s)

guys so i was a little bit more motivated for that reason also her health is better but my mother is also every bit as important in in my life and childhood and who i became and uh was the one that got me into activism and had me going door to door with and that all the protests with peta and greenpeace and all those things as a kid and got me studying art and introduced [2934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2934.599s)

me to dolly and picasso and gibran and blake and um you know brought me to all the world religions churches and um but going back to my dad here my dad had a strong patriarchal line that taught him some of these things his dad was first generation green beret and so [2956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2956.02s)

that you know thought that way but he also had a really up childhood with a humongous amount of trauma um his dad commits suicide his sister commits suicide is um many of his family members were in and out of incarceration and mental institutions and and um the violence of the childhood he was [2976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2976.3s)

in he's covered in physical scars from weapons you know like he had a rough go of it and so some of what he got he got directly but a lot of it was uh his way to not kill himself was to say maybe he's not crazy the entire world is crazy because the whole world he was exposed to seemed completely crazy to him [2997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=2997.78s)

and he'd rethink everything from scratch and so when you do that you come up with a lot of good and interesting things and also we're going to make a lot of mistakes and they're painful parts in the process and i didn't emphasize those in that letter because it wasn't um the purpose of the letter uh the article but [3017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3017.04s)

uh you know my path benefited from all the extreme gifts and it had some like quite quite interesting hardships as a result of the complexity of who he was from transcending his life all those other things is what got me in the therapy and uh which i'm also very grateful for because then i ended up getting a huge amount of [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3040.079s)

um you know basically parenting from the therapeutic traditions um the reason i say that is so that people don't think oh well i can't do well because i had trauma because i didn't have some of these gifts i everybody's life has some gifts and has some up stuff and the difficult stuff the healing of it is [3060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3060.119s)

what catalyzes their gifts and i just want to say that um and some of the gifts that he had were really fairly rare and unusual um and i'm very grateful for that some of the issues he had were somewhat unusual but when it comes to one of the things on the forgive he definitely had the gift of being physically heroic and [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3083.22s)

there are military men who are trained in that a lot of people are not in this age physically heroic in previous ages that was much more common there was a time here in encinitas and that was like uh wendy where which is usually not a violent area my dad was in the uh parking lot on thoroughfare here el [3108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3108.0s)

camino real gunshots rang out handful gunshots from a blind store and uh everybody who's in the parking lot around the other way or dropped my dad ran straight at the blind store um he figured the shooter was still alive and in there turned out to shoot her after killing the other person killed [3130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3130.5s)

himself so by the time my dad got into the shooter was dead um it was a husband who was going in there to suicide homicide his wife and the but he shot himself he stabbed her and when he thought he had finished killing her then he shot himself when my dad got there she was bleeding out but not dead [3154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3154.8s)

and so he started to put compression and tourniquets and whatever on in all the areas where the ambulance and police came but then he went to the hospital to be with her and then followed up with her afterwards and in addition to like she would have bled out if he was not there saving her life [3176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3176.7s)

was him wanting to make sure that she could forgive her husband for that because of knowing how up he was and that he's no longer you know in pain himself or arrest anybody else but that was like it was just default mode and i mean almost too fast it can be a bypass but in that moment it was both [3198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3198.0s)

and you know just a very interesting thing about him is like thinking the shooter was still alive he thought i can keep my body moving long enough if i take shots that i can take him out and more civilians won't get killed which means he was willing to risk his life for people he had never met he didn't even couldn't even see to know what color [3217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3217.319s)

they were a race or whatever this is very noble very beautiful and then the moment the harm of the dying was out of the way the harm of her holding on to that grudge and resentment was the next one he was focused on um what a gift to be exposed to and live with someone like that and and not only in [3238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3238.4s)

education but transmission music and to take up a theme my uh question i began with a little while ago it as you've described this it's getting more and more clear how your life has been uh self-developed and honed and gifted by multiple people to bring you to your life's work which has been the [[metacrisis]] and how we as a cease as a species in a civilization can continue because playly we're in danger right now and presumably will be forever after because the technology is probably only going to get more uh developed and greater capacities etc so you've been you've been uh you've had these ideals of service transmitted to you've had attitudes of of handling them skillfully [3300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3300.14s)

looking for complications thinking ahead etc you've also had the multi-disciplinary education so how does the how does the to these depths the spiritual depths that and self-inquiry you've gone through not only in spirituality but in psychotherapy and philosophic inquiry out of these how do these depths inform you about our our [3329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3329.819s)

contemporary crises and and what do you see lacking that these cat these steps when these depths aren't appreciated what do we now miss i'm speaking with a friend recently who does conservation work and she's a brilliant conservationist who has um kept huge important areas of high biodiversity intact and has done so at a significant devotion including expense [3379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3379.74s)

of her own personal life in other areas we were talking and she had just uh been in conversation with uh some of the world's wealthiest people and she asked me um when someone asks why should we protect nature how to answer it because that was obviously their question and i said um well there's a lot of answers that we can give that from a from the utility perspective of helping them get why they should care we we look at what they currently care about and we show a rationalized argument between why [3426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3426.24s)

the harm that would come to nature would harm something they would care about right we draw those connections but before getting there the fact that someone has to ask that question in earnest speaks to something broken in them um at minimum something pathologically underdeveloped and if they had had a life where they [3448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3448.68s)

grew up in any real contact with their own embodiment their own kind of biology and experience of being in a body being in in any real contact with nature and other sentient beings that question just wouldn't even arise um it would be prima facial right it would be it would be obvious and the question would simply be how do we do a better job with it [3475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3475.859s)

um and i saw one of the in the brief look one of the questions you sometimes explore with guests is like um what are the questions that orient their relationship to the sacred and i think at the and at the heart of it it's not even a [3498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3498.54s)

question right it's a something more like a perception um i think if someone is perceiving somewhat clearly then the sacredness of life is primification just is is and i don't remember the exact quote but it was uh um joseph campbell quote it was something [3526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3526.14s)

to the effect of that we think what we want is to know what the meaning of life is when what we're actually seeking is the experience of being fully alive and i don't think that is the whole because someone can experience being fully alive and fairly self-centered ways just doing uh you know extreme sports and whatever [3547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3547.26s)

um but it is also true that in the moments where someone is experiencing feeling fully alive they're not an existential angst about what is the meaning of life and i think that oftentimes the actual intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of meaningfulness of life that happens through a deep enough bandwidth of connection and sensing [3569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3569.94s)

uh the longing for that it's filtered through the mind as a desire to understand what is the purpose of all of this what is the meaning with a whole bunch of bad assumptions about like what thing is it building to it seems like a terminal value that then i can't that will be a satisfying answer where if we say well the purpose is love [3594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3594.359s)

then i say well what is the purpose of that or the purpose is learning what it's versus it's so we can the first the concept of purpose and the concept of meaningfulness are not identical but the reality of them and the concept of them are not the same either um and so how to develop a h a deeper connection to the to a deeper connection to life and deeper ability to perceive the innate uniqueness of everything and the interconnectedness of everything at the same time right the interconnectedness [3638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3638.04s)

of it all but not it's not it's not a homogeneous oneness where because if it's a homogeneous oneness doesn't matter how many of these ones die doesn't matter if a species goes if oneness is still oneness uh if it is just uniqueness but not interconnectedness well then in the service of this one i can damage these ones it's every part unique and every part radically interconnected in which case it is all an expression of the whole so i whatever i care about i also have to care about all of it because it's connected and also each part is irreplaceable and that's totally precious right and it's not that as the thought it's that is the perception from there [3678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3678.24s)

from that base state of perception i think the right other questions in analytics more naturally arise you know yes so the to the extent we can open ourselves to uh the totality of experience uh to to life the world and to ourselves to that extent in some ways and it's not in one sense one could say the questions [3707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3707.7s)

fall away because the questions are conceptual and we're you're now speaking to an experiential openness and directness uh that uh give birth to understandings or intuitions which can plow into concepts uh and but obviously i'm obviously in the concepts right i'm obviously into work and they're really good company um i wrote a blog piece a while ago called the dance of the dao and the ten thousand things and um maybe that one can be linked i'm specifically talking about that because you know there's this um concept in taoism the that every day in the practice of knowledge something is added every day in the practice of the data something is [3755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3755.579s)

dropped and but i think they are both meaningful and i think that not only there is a way in which learning more about the ten thousand things the field of conceptuality and interfere with one's connection to the doubt there's a way that it can also enhance it yes you don't know how they can dance [3778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3778.319s)

together if you don't know how it can enhance it then you have to just avoid intellect mind past future mostly the things that are uniquely sapient uniquely adult sapient and say look at the lilies of the field look at the little children you're like yes the things that don't have the prefrontal cortexes yes the prefrontal adult brain can cause problems but it also has [3799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3799.92s)

unique evolutionary purposes we just have to know how to use it right um two things there daniel one one is the intention what's the intention of using the intellect is it to get lost in the abstractions or is it in the service of a solution and the other is the skill and capacity to integrate into a kind of uh vision logic say [3821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3821.42s)

i think those are both part of it i had a friend that i think you know samantha sweetwater yes she hasn't been on this podcast she'd be great to be on she just left me a message this morning with a thought she was saying uh the way she phrased it was that sapiens is in service of sentience if it is to be rightly guided oh beautiful i thought [3843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3843.24s)

that was a nice way of phrasing it i um in terms of the greek the true the good and the beautiful triad i remember writing to an artist friend of mine on her birthday once uh that the true and the good only matter because the beautiful is um or no i think i said truth and goodness only a matter of beauty is that the beauty was actually the fundamental [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3868.02s)

thing if reality did not have intrinsic beauty i wouldn't actually care to be good do it or to know it or to whatever there's something that is intrinsic that is deeper than the why daniel yeah i have a follow-up question to all this and i know they they threw it at carl young so uh i'm gonna throw it at you um do you believe in god um music i remember many many years ago and i wouldn't phrase it this way any more at this maybe 15 years ago i wrote a poem called uh the atheist who writes love poems to god and um it was saying do i believe in god not in any god that is believable meaning that i don't remember where it went but the idea that what the word belief means is the idea that a proposition about reality actually maps to reality and so belief is a thing that can happen inside of propositional logic [3942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3942.599s)

and propositions have to be formed in semiotics right in in semantics and syntax do i believe that there is some sentences that i can say that define what god is uh uh where i would say yes that is a description that i think is both true and comprehensive and you [3967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3967.26s)

know adequate and no i don't i think that's why the first verse of the tattoo is the dao that is speakable is not the eternal thou so if you believe in the doubt you miss the whole thing sure um if you you can have a outside of semiotics outside of propositional experience outside of propositional knowledge experience of a kind of [3989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=3989.52s)

wordless knowing and a connection to wholeness but you don't then try to reduce that to propositions about the world so i think there's a lot of people that will have real experiences that are numinous and transcendent and then try to make a belief based on that and i think that's usually misguided [4012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4012.74s)

so uh if i wanted to speak to beliefs do i think that consciousness is an [[emergent property]] of brains probably not do i think that there are things that don't have brains including other types of biology and whatever that might have some quality over there or something that it is like to be them [4037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4037.46s)

probably yes but i'm holding all this i say probably even though i think there's some pretty strong arguments uh because i think too much certainty about any of these things is really problematic um do i think that it might not just be biology but that anything that self-organizes has some [4061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4061.4s)

type of interiority or softness in some kind of pan psychic type way yeah sure i do do i think that um even though each cell in our brain or body is its own self-organizing thing they come together to make something that is synergistically more than the [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4081.92s)

sum of them taken separately yes do i think that might be true for say universe as a whole or very large things within universe like galaxies or whatever yeah i think that's interesting so do i think that um there are types of sentients and types of intelligence [4103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4103.4s)

that are more deep and vast by far than our imagination can think about totally do i think that there's the possibility to in some meaningful ways connect there and have results come from that connection yes do i think that there is an inherent sacredness in all that is physically and metaphysically [4131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4131.179s)

yes i wouldn't reduce all that to saying i believe in god uh i rather think of it as something um more respectful than the reduction to a proposition i get that yeah um but but i was actually just talking with [4153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4153.02s)

um a very close friend the other day about an aspect of learning theory there are certain things that when i learned them i have to work to implement them as effectively as i can because i can't not i just i cannot and and uh and their many people who don't have that they um they forget that like they learn things and they forget and they're like oh yeah that was a bummer i forgot let me get back on path with it there's some different depth of the care about the [4199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4199.52s)

thing that is of course the result of all the exposure and whatever and i'm like yeah there is something where it is like actually like the differences actually believing there's a god right meaning um but it and that was the term that i used to just kind of make it simple in which if one actually believes there's a god then they can go they can work to [4221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4221.06s)

perfect themselves go to a happily die in a holy war whatever it is because there is some superordinate thing that is so important that everything else falls in line to that so there there is something for me and belief in karma can do that right there is something that is like believing in a god that is the ordinating basis of [4239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4239.659s)

everything for me but it isn't believing in a god and i can't do better with words no that yes i think that's a very sacred holy answer i think you handled it really well and thank you for even even doing that means a lot yeah and beautiful look certain that some of the some of the intimations in your response were about [4265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4265.239s)

the uh unknowable mystery of reality bottomless fathomless inconceivable and to the transconceptual nature of that mystery and actually of life that any that the ieo so the dao that can be named is not the eternal doubt and even more than that we can't any statement we make is you know is that it can be valuable but it's never fully adequate to the reality of [4299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4299.719s)

anything and to the extent that you think that you even unconsciously even fuzzily think of it as adequate now it's actually harming you yes because now it deadens your perceptions now it creates less you don't see the reality you see the frame of the reality that you expect to [4321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4321.199s)

see it in and you stop seeing where that model is inadequate which means you stop learning because you're now filtering reality through that model because it's convenient so in that sing the dance of the dao and the ten thousand things there's one part where i say do atoms exist i'm like kind of kind of because [4339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4339.92s)

uh uh and i'm and i didn't play with it from the point of view of is there physicality at all or is that all just nip a phenomenon of consciousness or is this a simulation i wasn't even playing with it in that direction i was just saying do atoms exist well the periodic table works pretty well we can actually uh do atomic level engineering and [4362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4362.02s)

chemistry pretty well right this is a it's about as good a science as we've got there's a a lot of um good empirical things regarding adults but when i define an atom the formal definitions will i we can do it in terms of the schrodinger equation or information theory or particle physics or whatever but we'll say okay you've [4388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4388.4s)

got nucleons and you have electrons and you have orbitals and whatever um you can say where in the periodic table row and column it is and it's an ion or but does that atom exist without the strong force does it exist without electromagnetism does it exist without the higgs field does it exist [4411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4411.92s)

without the gauge bosons that mediate the connections the gluons and the higgs bones it doesn't exist without any of those things and yet none of them are included in the definition when we say atom we take them all for granted so if i removed those that are not part of the definition do atoms exist nope nope so if i want to define an atom adequately that it actually exists can i [4434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4434.179s)

do that nope and so i have to take for granted a trans-finite amount of reality to define this thing in a way that is useful but is it real well i mean kind of you've walked your way into the buddhista and into the uh philosophy of the concealed in the revealed that any perspective unveils or conceals the universe and [4464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4464.38s)

simultaneously conceals and other one this is absolutely fascinating we could go anywhere with this but i want to i want to ask you um from this this perspective or these multiple perspectives you're bringing to bear on your own your understanding of of everything uh what do you see as some of the deeper unrecognized usually [4492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4492.08s)

unacknowledged causes of the [[metacrisis]] and i'll i'll just give a little context and i think one of the beautiful things about the way the way you appreciate the medical crisis is you're very aware of the traps of reductionism or what i would call a single focus fallacy uh which there are three years a single single issue fallacy the the [4517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4517.78s)

we're facing global warming that's it a single cause fallacy it's all due to capitalism and the single solution fallacy so i love the way you're thinking transcends those limitations and and recognize the traps of reductionism so i've been asking you what you see is some of the deeper causes i certainly acknowledge that you don't know these aren't it but they are [4544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4544.34s)

important elements and they're ones that don't often get don't as often get spoken to yeah okay to the question is understood are are there drivers or causes of the issues we face in the world and of the thing that [4572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4572.06s)

uh i sometimes call the [[metacrisis]] that we haven't defined here but i'm defining enough of their places if someone is not already familiar they can check it out that are not the ones that we usually talk about that are somehow deeper and i'm going to translate that to are there things in the inner landscape of people's um experience and psyche uh [4594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4594.739s)

specifically which is when we were saying are there spiritual dimensions or interior dimensions the reason i want to make the distinction is because i don't know that the term deeper makes sense um just for quick point of reference i would not say that i am a physicalist or an idealist [4621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4621.32s)

in the classic philosophical sense of physicalist meaning that physics comes first matter and force fields and um third person stuff and the consciousness emerges from that somewhere um nor am i an idealist in that consciousness comes first and all of the physics is an [[emergent property]] of consciousness structures of mind or [4641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4641.42s)

something i would say that um the the subjective stuff and the objective stuff whatever you want to think of that all the words have problems we could talk about first person third person can talk about um the quality and the physics [4661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4661.04s)

but they are equally fundamental and co-informing co-arising facets of an integrated reality and the relationship between them is part of that fundamentality so i wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics to the nature of reality um i think that's a weird kind of [4685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4685.159s)

dualism still um i think information theory affecting physics has already started to get a lot of people at least in this realm because if you say okay well consciousness stuff is deeper than physics stuff like well what is physics stuff well it's like atoms atoms or subatomic particles and subatomic particles or some weird [4705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4705.8s)

heisenbergen schrodinger thing which seems a lot like some type of pattern of information it doesn't sound like physics anymore right and it doesn't necessarily sound as different it's not like just some dead inert matter it doesn't sound as different from the consciousness stuff especially as you start to do a similar dive on with the conscious and stuff is [4728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4728.6s)

because you say well is that information processing on some information processing substrate what does that mean so in the same way that i wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics or the other way around i wouldn't say that the psychological drivers of the [[metacrisis]] are deeper than the technological or the economic [4749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4749.0s)

ones um i would say that they are co-informing co-influencing and that to really address it there are necessary things that have to happen across each of those areas and its efficiency only happens across all of them and uh i won't belabor the point because we've written and talked about it we wrote a paper um in the consilience project called why technology is not values neutral and it's worth people looking at and then beautiful paper yeah it shows just a brief overview of the work of marvin harris and um and marshall mcluhan and uh so many people and theory of technology of how [4799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4799.04s)

technologies change the nature of mind and psychology individually and collectively the nature of culture in ways that are really subtle and not uh not obvious so i you know there's always this question of um does the what technologies the world develops and what [[social system|social systems]] it develops are those the result of the consciousness and values of the people or the consciousness and the values of the people who are born as babies being conditioned by the world that they're in in the dominant systems and what things happen to be successful and if the world view and the technology it creates don't win at war it just gets wiped out um and so i i'm framing it this way because i think the deeper thing is actually really problematic it's uh you mentioned um roger the reductionism one type of reductionism is to say there's only one thing the other type is say there's a handful of things but my favorite thing is the most important one um and so being able to understand the co arising and non-reduced process [4869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4869.78s)

is actually really important um if i can introduce the concept here daniel i find i i have a neologism which is omni determinism everything determines everything and i think that's what you're speaking to yeah um yeah i might more usually talk about omni influence that everything is [4896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4896.78s)

influencing everything but not in a way that is absolutely deterministic because uh nice refinement thank you there are things that are outside of hard determinism still the influence the net result of what happens also when we say omni we mean in the direction of all inclusive but we can never actually know we're being all-inclusive um so in fact we can know for sure that we aren't being that's actually important um i can know for sure that i am not being all-inclusive because computationally it would be impossible um so the framing of the [[metacrisis]] we often talk about uh involves like a frame will use often is um from marvin harris's work but to understanding civilization you can think of it in terms of these three areas it's infrastructure it's [[social structure|social structures]] and it's [[superstructure]] its infrastructure is all the technologies the whole tech stack and all the modes of material development and like that the [4964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4964.78s)

[[social structure|social structures]] are all the collective agreement fields everything from the system of governance the law the institutions that mediate it and the [[superstructure]] is the religion the cultural ideology the values the definition of the good life so the the [[superstructure]] is kind of the spirituality psychology interiority of the people at the collective level [4989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=4989.179s)

and so of course we're always talking about that so i think seeing the top level frame of how all those fit together is worthwhile so if people haven't i'll just reference talked about in a bunch of places uh good friend nate higgins who's very good thinker on um specifically the relationship between the environment and energy and the [5011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5011.56s)

[[financial system]] and i just did a five-part series on his podcast and then the fourth part we do a kind of an overview of the [[metacrisis]] that covers this the third part unintentionally just because it came up we ended up covering how does one like emotionally psychologically and spiritually deal with the reality of the [5032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5032.08s)

[[metacrisis]] given that there's so much to care about beyond what we feel like we have a sense of agency about those are ones that people might find interesting the fifth one we talk about frameworks to things through solutions confidently so with all that prefacing i'll say some things here that i think maybe have not said as much other places [5050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5050.02s)

that are relevant to what in the interiority of human psyches and experiences and cultures uh is a key or key drivers of the problems of the world i want to mention how many things there are that we probably have no clue about that are really critical just just to [5076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5076.44s)

give a tiny couple examples um we know that there are a lot of species that have gone extinct at somewhere between 100 and a thousand times the background rate of extinction since the [[industrial revolution]] as a result of human activity those species are not just in the world externally there is a [5096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5096.88s)

similar [[biodiversity loss]] in [[species extinction]] in the microbiome of the human being and the microbiome of the human being produces some of the necessary chemicals for us to work our genome doesn't actually produce all the things some aspects of the macrophage binding protein and various things like that are not adequately coded in the genome [5119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5119.5s)

without a microbiome and um and so extinction of some of those is pretty humongous it's like deleting chunks of our genome right and but if you start having ubiquitous antibiotics and chlorine in the water and pesticide exposure and all those types of things so how much when you realize that somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of [5141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5141.94s)

the major mono and amine neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and agave are produced by the microbiome in the gut and that how you think how you perceive what you believe how happy you are what you your orientation towards violence will largely be a result of that how much of what seems like a spiritual crisis in the world is the result of [5162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5162.52s)

effects of the unintended consequences of um our kind of war on bacteria and biology and actually destroying part of the the code set that makes us able to be us that's not something that people often would think of when they're thinking of um the spiritual drivers of a thing but that is really important and if we you [5185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5185.679s)

know if we look at the anthropocene of the human built world there are so many aspects of the human bill world that built a world we did not genetically evolve in we're not genetically adapted to that makes us misfit to our own being in important ways um obviously for the 200 000 or 300 000 years of homo sapien [5208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5208.12s)

history in the couple million years of hominin history uh we always lived in tribes there was no such thing as not living in tribes until extremely recently but we've been this way long enough that it seems like the nuclear family household is the most obvious thing and the only thing that could ever be and we can't really imagine anything else and yet [5229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5229.179s)

evolutionarily we evolved to fit in tribes so we so all the about attachments theory we we love to have attachment to like 150 people like strong attachments and where our life literally dependent upon them we couldn't get our the the person who knows medicine is the only person who [5250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5250.42s)

knows medicine i'm not going to interact with other people so i can't just have a market opportunity to go to anybody so i actually need people and they need me so i can't be a to them so i can and everybody's going to see what everybody does so i can't lie and get away with it so like everything about psychology attachment theory uh bonding the ideas of codependence and [5266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5266.639s)

interdependence were totally different and we evolved in that setting right so then we get birth control and we're like oh sex doesn't have to equal reproduction anymore even though forever sex always equals the positive reproduction we evolved to have our neurochemistry means x equals the possibility of reproduction we put in birth control our neurochemistry and our [5286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5286.719s)

evolutionary biology didn't just change overnight but now we're acting in a way where it's like as if it doesn't mean that thing but a huge part of our whole being is responding that way so the reason i bring this up is if we were to try to comprehensively list all of the things that are conditioning our psyches in [5308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5308.26s)

ways that they did not evolve to process and that are not optimal for a set of individual thriving a community thriving or global thriving would be we this podcast would take days um and so that's a big topic i just wanna yeah um if and i say that because if i say anything else first i'm [5334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5334.659s)

concerned that people over norm on that as the thing and then again lose observation to all the things and complexity of all things so if i wanted to speak to something as the thing it would be the nature of mind that makes us lose orientation to the complexity and the interconnectivity of all the things um so if i was going to try to say what is the psychological [[generator function]] of the [[metacrisis]] one i think as good a way of saying it as i could is kind of it's not exactly the way david bone said it but it's derived from the way i heard him when he said the problems of the world result from a [5382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5382.9s)

fragmented consciousness that sees the world as a bunch of parts and doesn't see the wholeness of things and he talked about wholeness and the implicate order and can we perceive through that wholeness and obviously we know he was a student of einstein's and einstein said it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things there is one thing that [5401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5401.139s)

we call universe and that we have to work to develop our perceptions um so some of the problems in the world happen by be by intentionally advantaging some things at the expense of other things we know it'll cause an expense so we're advantaging our country at the expense of another [5422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5422.56s)

country in a war which means our people our land our riches or whatever at the expense of that for those people um that obviously means we're able to separate the world enough to be able to think about this trade-off of good for these ones and even though we know it's bad for these ones okay because we separate the [5444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5444.1s)

interconnectedness of everything and whether it's a country doing that to another country or in a relationship a person doing that to another person thinking they can possibly win a fight and someone they love actually not get their needs met and that equals a good life for them somehow which is ridiculous idea um uh or at the level of corporations or anything else or humans with regard to the biosphere other animals we can advantage ourselves at their expense which obviously a [[factory farm]] in a and uh industrial fishing fleet are not good for those animals or not good for the oceans are not good for the people working on them in poor conditions [5482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5482.5s)

the other problems in the world is where we didn't know that we're causing the harm right so we can either benefit something at the expense of something else knowingly or we can benefit something at the harm of something else not knowing so [[conflict theory]] and [[mistake theory]] um and the real politic assessment of humans is the problems in the world are [5502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5502.84s)

because we are dumb and nasty right like roughly if you want to make it very simple dumb is we caused problems that we didn't anticipate and nasty as we call problems that we knew were going to happen and so the how do we enlighten humans has to deal with both the dumb and nasty part right if we're talking if we're talking about how do we have the not not just how do you affect human [5525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5525.46s)

behavior through different rewards and deterrents and social norms and systems of law but through people wanting something different having an internal motivational basis it would be can we expand the circle of care where they care about more that's even the nasty part and can we expand the complexity of process where they can actually calculate their [5547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5547.3s)

effects so that they are not unintentionally harming things more that's the deal of the dumb part um but similarly there if i'm thinking about co2 and how critical it is to get it down but i'm not thinking about ocean [[dead zone|dead zones]] uh from nitrogen affluence using nitrogen fertilizer to grow more crops [5569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5569.32s)

that will sequester more co2 it seems like a good idea even though it's going to cause this other externalized issue so again my ability to separate the ocean [[dead zone|dead zones]] and the co2 is what's causing that unintentional harm right or thinking about that facebook will be some cool system for people being able to tag photos and get to know each other not thinking about what its effect on [5590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5590.26s)

democracy will be with that particular ad model i would say all the problems look like people all the problems come from harm happening somewhere as a result of human choice but the choice was motivated by someone trying to benefit something so they're all based on trade-offs so it's either i'm trying to benefit myself now [5612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5612.58s)

at my own future expense addiction and compulsiveness i am uh so the parts conflict can even be within oneself right um i'm trying to benefit my people my religion my nation my political party whatever at the expense of the other one so great you get your political party elected you polarize the population worse next time they'll swing back [5635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5635.199s)

harder and you're actually not progressing anything other than increasing polarization um or i am seeking to benefit things and the harm i'm causing elsewhere i just didn't know i didn't know that leachate was going to cause that pollution over there or whatever the other thing is so when bone was talking about the fragment [5656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5656.02s)

of consciousness it was both at the level of aware of the connectedness and care about the connectedness and so really the key is seeing reality as parts right same reality is a bunch of separated parts leads to being able to care about apart and seek to advantage it in a way that causes harm to other things and then [5680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5680.62s)

cascade effects of other agents doing this similar stuff and so you get cumulative arm effects and you get escalating [[arms race|arms races]] so not being able to perceive stuff as a bunch of separated parts but perceiving everything in relationship to everything else perceiving everything as a part of an interconnected whole where your ability to benefit that thing had to [5697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5697.48s)

mean both caring about everything that it's connected to and being able to think through everything that's connected to come up with a strategy that is omni beneficial or as close to that as possible and that where you made a mistake in it you're also ongoingly aware and working to correct it i would say from the psychological perspective that's [5715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5715.98s)

probably as deep a thing as we can say and even stuff like but aren't people wouldn't wouldn't we say impulsiveness and selfishness and addiction or even deeper than that because obviously all of the environmental harm is happening because people are buying too much to get a keep up with the joneses or get a hit of something well it's still the same thing right like [5736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5736.3s)

it's um it is still the thing of their future self is being armed for their momentary self because their momentary self feels  up enough that it thinks that it needs to get ahead um so the parts conflict the theory of trade-off starts within the self between the parts of itself the jungian parts reconciliation then would be the basis [5758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5758.08s)

for being able to also have a wholeness of self in relationship the wholeness of world okay um yeah let me let me um a couple of things uh given that and i've listened to uh you talk about these issues a lot and sometimes i'm just left with just oh we are so you know but [5783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5783.159s)

given that the solution of survivability as our current species on this our home uh seems to be ignorance and just uh being bad actors uh do you feel that enough of us if there's any kind of hope or sense that enough of us can evolve to a level where we can recognize this fractured and recognize what we're doing enough to [5814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5814.3s)

keep us together as a human family connected to the whole so that we can survive this this choke point in our evolutionary history i don't think there is much of a human family to keep together that is anything other than an abstract idea at this point that some people hold and many people don't even hold that's an idea [5844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5844.48s)

um i think the question of is it possible to make it through the issues that the world is facing today the whole plurality of issues that are unprecedented historically because we hadn't had sentries of industrial tech bringing us up to [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and we hadn't had [[exponential tech]] or even small number of actors could everything up so quickly and we didn't have a world that had so much fragility um given that we could have massive catastrophic harm from so many different vectors from synthetic bio-created pandemics and from ai autonomous drone weapons and from [[climate change]] and from chemical [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and from scaling war is there to make it through we have to avoid all of those to fail we only have to have any of them happen um and our track record doesn't look good right if you look back at the history of empires at all uh the history of war and environmental destruction is a pretty big part of that [5920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5920.98s)

story we don't seem to be really noble stewards of power so as we're getting exponentially more power and we've usually used our power to do power games with each other meaning destroy each other and in ways that harm the environment is there any way that we can steward exponential power in a finite space i would say it takes a step function [5942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5942.04s)

like uh it it will take something significant that is more than just the continuation of whatever good aspects the enlightenment created or something like that um in the huge shift after world war ii it was a big shift we made a whole new [[world system]] but the answer was still uh extract more from nature even faster [5967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5967.92s)

make more money and make more attack like the bread and woods [[world system]] was a a [[world system]] but in more increase for everybody was still a somewhat easier thing to do than when you're hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and you have to say no you actually have to reduce consumption across everybody where a lot of people are like no i would rather not reduce my consumption [5987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=5987.04s)

go to war and have less people and i think i can win like this it's hard the situation we're in right now is unprecedented at a global level in such deep ways right so do i think it is possible to make it through i think the question is it possible to make it through without great harm doesn't even make sense because we're in [6008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6008.219s)

[[species extinction]] and war today like great harm has happened today people are being killed in ukraine people are being killed in armenian azerbaijan people are being killed all over because of these issues and species are going extinct today so we're already in the great harm phase um i almost know adolescents don't have [6029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6029.04s)

body dysmorphia in the instagram etc world like that's so we're already in that right now do i think we can make it through without catastrophes where hundreds of millions of people die is one question do i think we can make it through where there are any humans left i think we may get through where there are humans in something that isn't [6053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6053.34s)

just a totally scorched earth these are all different questions um the answer can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no no no chance so so so given all this the the question comes up how then should we live given the truth of [6074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6074.46s)

well this next part is critical can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no they're going to intensify because no matter what we do today there is no enactable path to preventing the extreme weather events that [[climate change]] alone is going to mediate there's a lot of things like that and then the human migration that's [6096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6096.42s)

going to come from that we can if we do the very best things we can make it less bad but there is also no we there is no we that is a unified acting group right um the what china's interests are and what the us's interests are what the individual with the left and right within the us's interests are what the individual us people versus the elites in it they're not the same [6120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6120.54s)

and so the whole like one of the biggest mistakes i made growing up was i always saw it in this royal we did like humanity thoughtfully was all reading bucky's pl operating manual for spaceship earth and we're all you know thinking about you and charters and looking at the earth from the astronauts perspective and carrying carl sagan's pale blue dot and of course we want to [6141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6141.0s)

do the right ends mark and good thing for everybody uh the the thing that some people think is really good other people think is really horrible and when you realize that the enactment gets really hard right is is the legality of abortion protecting women's freedoms and rights or is it [6163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6163.86s)

murdering infants um you'll see the most severe uh ideological differences on what is good they create a basis for massive conflict and you see that across so many things right so um that's why i say that there isn't a human family to hang together like that's that's an aspirational thing [6187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6187.139s)

um do i think that if there is already a trajectory of some people who care about not just their own political party or their own nation or their own race or even their own species but care pretty considerately and are working in service of that there are increasing number of people who have both more care more capacity and more interconnectivity and they cannot then also work with other [6211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6211.02s)

people who maybe don't care about all of that but in increasingly good coordination for the things they do care about yes that's happening right there's a good thing an emergence that is happening do i think that that could be sufficient to make it through without total extinction or scorched earth yes totally do i think it can make it [6232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6232.56s)

through without the catastrophes intensifying no they will intensify before even on the best course do i think that it's a given that we make it through no which means we are no matter what in a phase of increasing intensity ahead and with i think both the what it takes to avoid all the catastrophes is deep enough change to the [[world system|world systems]] that it's like that boomian thing that we are neither harming each other on purpose or accident which means a kind of more universal omni consideration or things like a human family is actually a you know a real thing uh so i think in order to not have it get much worse changes have to happen at a deep enough [6275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6275.46s)

level that it gets much better so i do think there's something like a pretty hard fork and i think it can go either way and i think it is not determined and i think it is increasingly potent and hard over the next while on in figuring that out so with that then the question how do we live um as the frame is [6297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6297.719s)

i can't imagine a context in which one's choices could matter more indeed it gives a whole nother level and uh depth and dimension to uh the choices we make and the priorities we serve and the how we live our lives and offer our lives and so what what are some of the parameters for an effective contributing [6338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6338.88s)

life that you've seen a few more resources that i'll offer here another short little blog i wrote on how to live a meaningful life uh which was intentionally not answering the question what is the meaning of life which we discussed earlier [6368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6368.04s)

um but it said a meaningful life and it was just it's a way of talking about it there's lots of ways of talking about it that's not particularly better than lots of other ways but i um there's something that is kind of comprehensive and kind of elegant about it so uh for it [6387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6387.36s)

and it was looking at uh the mode of being the mode of doing and the mode of becoming all being relevant and defining all of them in terms of beauty and that thing we said earlier the truth and goodness matter because beauty is so there it says the motive being at its essence is about really deeply [6411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6411.239s)

taking in the beauty of reality and appreciating it giving gratitude for it honoring it loving it you know all those things it's the essence of what the mode of being is really about and that the mode of doing is about being in service to the beauty of reality protecting it adding to it perfect and the mode of becoming is deepening [6436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6436.5s)

the capacity for being and doing that i can appreciate ever more fully and that i can add to it every monthly and that a meaningful life is a recursive relationship between those three um and if what i'm doing isn't arising out of everything's up so i have to fix everything but it's arising out of perceiving [6461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6461.219s)

working on this hunger issue because we're perceiving the utter meaningfulness and beauty of these kids or these people in their life and the importance of it and the and so then the doing the desire to serve and protect arises not from the perception of all the badness but actually arises from the perception of the beauty from which the good which also means the bad is framed [6482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6482.58s)

at all right so the thing that really is terrible and pisses us off is because something that is beautiful and sacred is being harmed which then brings us back to there's something that we actually love and have devotion to so we trace it back to that and say how do i be in service there so the doing must arise from the being [6501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6501.54s)

and the becoming is i don't just want to perceive the beauty i currently see i want to perceive ever deeper dimensions of things that i had missed you know i want to ask what aspects of the of reality are important and beautiful that i'm missing that other people are noticing that i'm not honoring as fully as i could um and then similarly with our doing where do i have frameworks for what i'm where is what i'm doing coming from ego and trauma and wounding where have i been running a strategy so long if i stopped and thought about it from scratch i might come up with something better you know like i want to be deepening the doing as well so i think if one relates to [6547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6547.08s)

appreciating the beauty of life adding to it deepening the capacity for both that's a nice framework to start um and then there was another resource put on there called dharma inquiry which is more personal because that's obviously true for everybody that our main query gets more into specific things one is bothered by and is inspired by and has [6571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6571.38s)

aptitude at and is called to to have a sense of what is your unique relationship to that is your own dharma with it i realized that there's something both very beautiful about the kind of bodhisattva direction and something that is incomplete about a certain direction of it i was i was incredibly influenced by [6596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6596.119s)

valve the bodhisattva and the may i become whatever is needed and when you look around and try to perceive what is needed and try to develop within yourself what can offer something there i remember the the first time i actually read it was in alex gray's art book the i think sacred mirrors and he had the ability painting and then he had this [6622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6622.619s)

poem next to him so beautiful and it said something like where there is uh thirst may a rainfall upon the people in miami may i myself become that rain where there is hunger may i be transformed into the food near them where there is illness may have become the medicine you know wherever there is need of any kind [6641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6641.82s)

may i become what is needed i think that helps one to recognize that what they love is deeper to who they are than who they think they are beautiful because i think i like these things and i don't like these things i'm good at these things not these things but oh i can't help with that because i'm not a [6663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6663.719s)

a legal scholar or i'm not a construction worker i'm not a whatever it is and yeah it's like but if that's the thing that is most needed and would help what you care about most can you can you become something that you are not and i've had many times where there was something that i was not good at that i actually really identified as a thing i would never want [6684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6684.179s)

we go down and realize that it actually mattered to what i cared about enough that if i held that limited identity i was not in maximum service to what i claim to care about and i had to get like well i i care about what i care about so long as it fits with my identity easily identity so that's what i like about the battle of the bodhisattva [6707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6707.04s)

but where it's missing something is i really am not equally good at all the things that are needed nor can i do all of the things even if i try there's a lot of people have to do all the things so if medicine work is needed and if economics change is needed and if care of the individual people and animals is needed as well as macro systemic [6731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6731.82s)

thinking about systems to do that cool not only what is most needed but what is most needed that my being is well developed to be able to be in service to is important and so those dharma questions are trying to help hone that for people beautiful and and you're pointing to the kinds of [6753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6753.3s)

questions we need to ask ourselves in order to in order to orient ourselves to be most effective instruments of service or for the in the bodhisattva aspiration for the welfare and awakening of all and i really think that probably that body side for aspiration may be one of the highest ideals the miners human mind has ever come up with and such a beautiful thing and you're pointing now to the [6780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6780.48s)

questions we ask which the first question that emerges is well what what can i do but then you're pointing to the idea that this because there are questions deeper than that what's the most effective thing i can do and d and along with that the question well the colon actually what am i called to do and deeper still in your implication is is the question how can i live my life [6808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6808.38s)

so as to be an optimal instrument of service and each of those is i think better thought of as a as a cone or a wisdom question and i would draw the distinction saying a conceptual question is you know is it raining outside take a look no end of question but wisdom questions are more like cons every time you ask them they have the potential for [6829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6829.92s)

taking you deeper into the question deeper into life deeper into yourself and so you're pointing us towards we're the real the wisdom questions of our time i would also say that almost every value or principle lives in a dialectical relationship with another value or principle that is complementary but they might seem almost [6853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6853.44s)

opposite and that without holding them together the full version of just that one thing the reducto atom of it actually becomes evil and so this is the everything can be a medicine or everything can be a poison topic um so what is what is my unique self calling what is that which i can offer the world based on the unique set of experiences and capacities i have that no one else could offer that if i spend my life doing things other than that that other people could do the most novel offering that i have doesn't occur [6899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6899.76s)

that's a deep and important and beautiful question but taken to its extreme it'll make you a total because often do the dishes when you need to do the dishes no it's not your unique self the only thing that you can do like anybody can do the dishes or take out the trash but like damn a lot of life is just doing the dish out of the trash and maybe the unique self that [6920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6920.88s)

you have is in is unexpressible infinitesimal qualities with which you show up to those things you know um so the what is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do and what needs done that nobody wants to do i'll just show up to you got to hold those together [6943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6943.56s)

right because also on the other side if you always just say what is nobody what is the shittiest job that nobody wants to do let me show up to that which is this incredibly a nobling question incredibly beautiful question you can also in the uh failing at some unique self dharmas and capacities you could have because of [6965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6965.82s)

only orienting that way and so uh every every principle and every virtue needs held in a dialectical relationship and not over normed is absolute yeah and this is the ancient concept of the interdependence of virtues that that they require require each other and complement one one another and you i [6991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=6991.08s)

think you're also pointing to the contextual nature of our inquiries that we have to keep the context as well so again a beautiful beautiful reflections and deepening and expanding our that i see you pointing us to yeah and i've i've just felt that we've been spending i don't know x amount of time in the heart of philosophy and i feel a connection with fin century athens and [7017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7017.48s)

all of that stuff it started long ago in another land and it's still it's still churning in a universe that can produce um a u and to me can't be all bad and uh i feel deeply moved and deeply um uh renewed in my commitment to do my little things you know whatever that calling might be and i think i pretty [7045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7045.199s)

much found that but also to shampoo my dog and take out the trash and you know wipe the counters and that sort of thing you know and you say it can't be all bad it's funny because so i focus on the [[metacrisis]] which is like all the most up stuff that could be all together um it kind of seems like that but it's not really what i focus on i mean it's [7065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7065.719s)

in appreciation and love of this world and life there's the desire to protect it and uh so paying attention to things that need protecting but where does the motivation come from the motivation doesn't come things being  up the motivation comes from the wonder of it right from the beauty of it like i've had i know you you both talk about bringing the philosophic concepts into daily practice on this show a lot and you know i've had a lot of practices throughout my life in terms of types of meditation and types of inquiry and whatever but like i wake up in the morning and the first thing i do pretty much [7118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7118.46s)

every morning is i just look out the window at the trees and i just watch the trees move in the wind for a little bit and i don't i don't have to try to care about them or try to find them beautiful they're just beautiful and there's a happiness that comes just watching that and then there's a gratitude to be alive [7138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7138.44s)

in consciousness you know arising again and there's happiness to be on this planet and then there is a because of the happiness it comes from just the perception of the beauty of it i don't need that much for myself right there's not an unhappiness it needs me to do a bunch of stuff and then there's this gratitude that i i like i was sleeping this con this daniel consciousness wasn't here and then in boots again and now it's here and i think about when daniel's dead the consciousness that we'll be perceiving the world and falling in love for the first time and climbing trees and reading hafez and rumi for the first time it's all the things and i can't not feel connected to [7179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7179.239s)

those consciousnesses a hundred and a thousand years from it like i can't not feel what it feels like to perceive through those eyes and it's i'm actually not trying to get it to go anywhere i just want that kids get to keep experiencing falling in love with trees for the first time and mothers get to keep falling in love with their kids and people get to fall in [7201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7201.56s)

love and do poetry for the first time and get heartbroken and all the things the pot like it is intrinsically already meaningful without going anywhere and it's already beautiful and you know one of the other things i know y'all talked about is peak experiences and one of the things i always felt is once you have had one of them [7224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7224.9s)

like for me i remember i remember discreetly i've talked about before there was this one time i was watching a sunset and writing poetry to nature and watching a sunset as a teenager and i remember the sunset was just so incredibly beautiful and i remember thinking if i had the choice if there is a spirit before this life if i had the choice to come here and incarnate and go through whatever painful things that i've went through my whole life just to get to have this one experience of color and vision and the wind and the insects in this moment would totally do it like i would take every pain in my whole life to have had this experience as opposed [7270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7270.56s)

to no experience and then i'm like i've had that i've had so many of these experiences and one of them is worth incarnating for i've had so many of them and so it's like the fact that i will probably have more of them is gravy and it's like a ridiculous beauty and abundance but that every that future life gets to [7292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7292.94s)

keep having those and that other people get to have more of those is kind of more what i'm motivated by then they make us a better persons when we experience those things it it shifts you know something happens uh uh maybe just a little bit but something happens in a positive thing and shifts in our soul and iron carriers and maybe we behave a little a little better or a [7317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7317.239s)

lot better i'm not sure i think the what's in it for me thing chills out you know and it's not that it doesn't reboot because we're complex people with lots of parts and there will be a pain body that reboots and so it's not like enlightenment is a static thing and you have a satori and then you never have a pain body boot again it does but there's something about even just [7340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7340.219s)

thinking about and just being like there could have been no i no experience at all and there's experience and have been such amazing ones and and i feel this pretty much with every difficulty or trauma too is like when you've done the healing work with it you don't still feel messed up by the trauma or the pain but you do feel [7368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7368.119s)

ongoingly benefited by the lessons and it's kind of like a lot of people don't have the resources or know how to do the healing so they never get the lessons and they're just always affected by the pain and that's a bummer but if one kind of has the resources knows how to work on it then the pain is temporary and the gifts are lasting and it's like this just beneficial [7391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7391.4s)

asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry where it's like yeah i just i'm a yes to the whole thing let's say yes to the whole thing yeah and there's there's a beautiful uh couple of lines that came out of san quentin prison uh there's a project uh group guiding rage into pain which people work very intensely with with people many of them life as many of them [7415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7415.28s)

have been murderers and work on life transformation their ideals the body side for aspiration the commitment is even if i stay in my in this prison for the rest of my life i'm going to do what i can to help people and one and one of them after after the and is a very intensive exploration of their pain and the trauma they've both caused and received and these are very [7440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7440.06s)

traumatized people and there's a video of one of these sessions in which one of the one of the prisoners suddenly lights out lights up and says oh i get it hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people it's like oh oh it's so beautiful yeah i think they're both self-propagating [7465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7465.38s)

yeah i would love to explore that with you daniel uh we've gone long and far and deeper maybe that's the wrong word to explore the the darkness and the addiction and the way out of that and just what you said um roger uh hurt people hurt people and heal people heal people and that's uh maybe that's a good place to wrap it uh [7489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7489.44s)

for this evening i really enjoyed the conversation with both of you i think that the this podcast where you're exploring these topics and sharing with people is uh a really beautiful service and i'm honored to get to be here with you oh it's such a delight to anyone it's such a such a gift to be able to [7511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7511.82s)

that hurt people hurt people that there is some autopoetic trauma force almost and there's also some kind of auto poetic healing or integrative force that if you wanted to think of the light and dark sides of before so that's actually kind of a good way of thinking of it is the auto propagation of those things music um and we wanted to explore that sometime maybe also if the listeners have thoughts or questions or topics coming from this that can inform it we can get to those next time too right well we'll we hereby extended invitational listeners to let us know the questions you have for daniel and uh i think you're [7579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAcB0yBtXLM&t=7579.02s)
