been studying working on um for for years this is as uh what like maybe five years ago when we when we met four four or five years ago when we met i knew you were thinking about [[sensemaking]] and rebuilding civilizations and i'm curious um you know i've had the pleasure of just kind of being around you for years [24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=24.96s)

what's the best way to to tell probably a new audience about your work i feel like yeah i'm wondering i'm wondering your favorite way to explain that um i know that i have a favorite way to explain it but uh i'll jump in if i'll give my perspective but i'd love to [49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=49.039s)

hear uh what if you have a shock kind of just a brief narrative from the beginning is uh i was homeschooled growing up so i got to kind of make my own curriculum which was fortunate uh and a lot of it had to do with activism my mom was big into activism so i got into environmental work and animal rights [72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=72.0s)

work and social justice issues young and my dad was into lots of areas of science and engineering and philosophy so i was getting to have that braid of topics and as i was um exploring activism one of the things that i found was how profoundly interconnected the problems were and how [98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=98.64s)

the solutions weren't adequately addressing them and this started showing up all over the place in terms of looking at why are the ecological issues advancing and not getting better despite the huge amount of effort happening in the nonprofit space and government for benefit space what is fundamentally inadequate [114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=114.0s)

about the nature of the solution i remember being 13 working on helping some project that was in kenya protecting elephants from poaching in an area that was already protected that the poachers could get in and so i was 13 so i was just in the u.s like going door-to-door raising money and writing letters and [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=133.36s)

uh but there the people who were there on the ground were having their life threatened by the poaching groups and the solution was bigger fences around the preserve so poachers couldn't get in and legislation in the country for harsher sentencing for poachers and the solution after a couple years of like blood sweat and tears [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=151.76s)

finally worked but it didn't address the poverty of the people that were poaching and the fact that you know they were in parts of the world where uh you know 25 000 kids are starving to death a day it didn't address black markets on animal products it didn't address mindsets towards animals it didn't [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=169.28s)

address a macro economy that creates poverty at scale and you know ships it to the third world it didn't address any of those issues so the same poaching groups moved and started hunting both the mountain gorilla and the white rhino more than they had been both of which were more endangered and i got to see this because i wasn't just [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=185.84s)

looking at one issue i was working with enough groups that i got to see that those were connected and so the tremendously hard and well motivated work solved one problem but actually moved the underlying [[problem space]] to show up in areas that were even more sensitive and that's really devastating because the only kind of hope [202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=202.879s)

that i had to deal with the devastation of the nature of the problems was that something could be done about it and so uh fortunately i was also studying not just all the different areas of science that i could but a system of science and bucky fuller's work and capra's work and kind of how do how do all the things fit together and so i started looking at activism [224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=224.799s)

from that lens and saying how can we understand the nature of the problems well enough that we can come up with solutions that solve that problem but also don't externalize harm elsewhere and that required starting to get into economics and the nature of why did this [[perverse incentive]] arise and what would it take to internalize [245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=245.519s)

[[perverse incentive]] and externality and the nature of governance systems and culture and basically civilization writ large so then that led to saying okay well there's a lot of there's a lot of things that we can say are getting better you can listen to hans rosling or stephen pinker and you know pick things [264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=264.16s)

that are getting better but you can also look at most environmentalists or people studying [[existential risk]] and look at things getting worse and both are the case there are some metrics getting better there are some getting worse that's a destabilization of the overall space but the things that are getting worse are leading to catastrophic tipping points that will break the substrate that allows the things that are getting better to matter though i start forecasting uh how long do we have on the various things and started reading limits of growth by club of rome and uh all of the different kind of forecasts as well as studying [[civilizational collapse]] theory uh tainter and baudrillard and you know things like that how because it becomes pretty clear when you study history that all of the great empires that lived for hundreds or thousands of years don't still exist whether it's i'm curious how old are you when when you're just you're diving into this [318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=318.8s)

uh inquiry is just so fascinated that you're you're you're so interested and have the dedication to dive into this when when does this occur in your life i mean this kind of the threat of my whole life just progressively deeper inside the prospects you know if you spend if you spend time talking with kids [346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=346.88s)

where you listen and then actually give them space for the questions to emerge uh the dedication is there like they'll i do nature walks with kids and they want to ask around about how do trees suck up water and how how does the light thing work and how do all the animals and everything interact and very deep questions they want to know [373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=373.84s)

why the sky is blue which actually requires understanding things about optics and about astronomy and about the sun about astrophysics and you know as well as like the nature of consciousness what is the [[subjective experience]] of blue and school just doesn't do a great job of actually facilitating that curiosity and so if we force people to be interested in they aren't interested in and don't facilitate their interests and the things they're actually interested in we kind of break their interest and they want to use some [[hypernormal stimuli]] um so i was just fortunate that the things that were interesting to me i got to pay [411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=411.28s)

attention to and i think anyone that gets to continue to pay attention to the things they're interested in learns but they also double down on their own interests so the things i'm describing now were a lot of my kind of teenage focus and uh and so i started looking at you know [430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=430.0s)

forecasting and [[civilizational collapse]] models anything from environmental collapse from overfishing and you know peak resource utilization to pollution issues to you know climate type issues as well as what are the things that lead to large-scale war and infrastructure collapse and those types of things and um [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=454.639s)

that led to recognizing that as our technology exponentiates and the power of our choices exponentiate but our quality of choice making is not getting commensurately better to the power of our choice making we're having more and more different escalation pathways to [[catastrophic risk]] globally and higher and higher probability of [479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=479.28s)

them where if we try to think about like biotech risks or nanotech risks or ai mediated risk or large-scale war grid collapse if we tried to solve any of them on their own they're almost all impossible to solve and there's too many of them so i started thinking about what is driving all of them why are humans coordinating at scale in a way that uses our technological power in ways that either directly through [[conflict theory]] cause problems war and you know war and exploitation that is known or through [[mistake theory]] cause problems unintended externalities [517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=517.839s)

and a lot of it is that right like i don't think the people when they were making facebook knew that it would destroy the entire information ecology but it did so that's very nation theoretic issue so we started thinking about are there is there some set of underlying dynamics that give [535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=535.12s)

rise to how humans are coordinating that are what gives rise to all these problems the [[generator function|generator functions]] of them and to just start to think about like [[perverse incentive]] as long as uh military industrial complex is one of the largest blocks of the global economy and war is profitable and you have uh the capacity for the supply side to manufacture artificial demand [558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=558.16s)

can you have a for-profit military-industrial complex that the entire global economy depends upon and lasting peace in a supply and demand equation well no so we have to deal with [[perverse incentive]] there that's one example we can see it in healthcare and we can see it in mining and we can see it everywhere and so [576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=576.32s)

you start looking at is the nature of the incentive system the [[economic system]] where 50 to 100 trillion dollars a day of human activity moves but is either directly causing harm or indirectly causing externality could we shift that in a way where that incentive system what what was in the incentive of an [596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=596.8s)

individual or a corporation or a nation was in the ins was in the well aligned with the well-being of the whole better right so these were the questions i was asking trying to study the austrian school and straight kind of laissez-faire approaches or socialist approaches or marxist approaches or like [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=613.68s)

techno-optimist automate everything approaches and i got to see that there were strengths and weaknesses of a lot of them and none of them were actually adequate to space so put together some research groups that were working on understanding the space the [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[catastrophic risk]] well enough to say [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=629.6s)

is there an is there a categorical set of solutions to the underlying dynamics of how humanity coordinates effectively that is the kernel of a new civilization model and that when we study civilizational decay of what made rome fall and egypt and the aztecs and the mayans and et cetera [649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=649.36s)

that if we understand the dynamics that give rise to [[civilizational collapse]] can we have something that really addresses all of those dynamics and addresses all of the uh escalation pathways to the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] we can see so so it sounds like almost correct me if i'm wrong but maybe a simple way to put that is [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=671.36s)

if you were to redesign civilization from scratch how would you do it is that is that it's almost the frame of like well everything that we've done has these strengths and weaknesses what would we do if we do it again from scratch is that is that kind of where you're coming from here [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=691.2s)

well this is a valuable question and it's an insufficient question and i spent a lot of time i was young asking it without recognizing uh the enactment problem okay so sure we actually get there in factoring that that seems that all the people are conditioned currently who are in power in a way that [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=714.399s)

would resist that and it seems to be not in the immediate best interest of the game theoretic environment so yes it's an important [[thought experiment]] if we were going to redesign simply say scratch how would we how do we think the best run planet would run uh most enlightened planet would be then we have in the current scenario what is actually a viable path there and some degree you reverse engineer from the idea of a future state to some degree forward engineer how can we be vectoring in the right direction and increasing our capacity to continue to vector in the right direction so what i'm hearing is [751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=751.04s)

great [[thought experiment]] hey google lights on that's not uh eugene do you mind muting yourself although it's a great [[thought experiment]] change just doesn't start we can't just hit a button and then and then redesign you're saying cool great thought experience to have [775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=775.839s)

that vision to think about what is that beautiful thing um and changes changes evolution change is it's a it's messy right to actually get to that vision we actually have to start with where we are yeah so where are we and where do we where do you see us actually being able to go from where we are [806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=806.88s)

so i'll try to bridge this to some of what wade was talking about talking about the unraveling of the american empire i think we can look at and i don't claim to be representing his views accurately here but just kind of piggyback on some of the thoughts we can look at the [834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=834.88s)

united states system and say is it undergoing civilization civilizational decay in the way that led to the breakdown of previous civilizations and what would the signs of that be what kind of things can we look for we can also look at the global system that the world has actually run on since world war [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=857.519s)

ii that has been us-based and it's very important to look at these together from the u.s perspective we can you know one just kind of quick insightful thing is that throughout history democracies or republics systems of [[participatory governance]] that were at scale not like small tribal scales never made it to 300 years right they [880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=880.959s)

have a fairly short life cycle all uh empires died but some of the dynastic ones made it a thousand years and the ones that were more [[participatory governance]] systems lasted less long the us is at around 250 years depending upon you know exactly the start date you pick so this is the time cycle factoring history of the the adequate decay of a republican to understand why there's a bunch of reasons why uh and i won't get into all of them but the people who are willing to fight a revolutionary war to make something happen right if they lived in the direct experience of tyranny of government and where they were willing to die rather than let themselves be governed in a way that felt tyrannical then they're also so willing to do the extraordinarily hard work of [[participatory governance]] which means show up at the town hall not let just let somebody else make the decisions read all the papers be actively informed [942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=942.88s)

about what's going on so that you can participate in governance because you have the direct experience of how terrible not being involved in your own governances but as time goes on and several generations pass and that just becomes a myth that no one has any embodied experience of and there's like mortgages to pay and [961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=961.44s)

stuff on tv and to do um i don't even want to go to jury duty let alone be really actively informed and engaged in [[participatory governance]] so if the people stop checking the state and it's no longer truly a governance of foreign by the people then the state stops being able to do what it's supposed to do which is check the predatory aspects of [981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=981.68s)

the market i'll i'll just make this frame because that's an important frame absolutely i love it one way thinking about all of the problems in the world is that they're all coordination problems um that it's patterns of human behavior at scale that cause them and it needs to be different patterns of [1002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1002.16s)

human behavior at scale to solve them and so how do we get lots of people to coordinate their behavior when they want different things and they have different understandings of the world and different world views in ways that lead to better solutions for the individual groups and the whole overall it's a hard thing when the [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1021.279s)

churchill said about democracy and the founding fathers here said something similar that democracy is the single worst form of government ever created saved for all the other forms what they meant is the idea of governance that you get a lot of different people to actually participate together is just a really hard proposition [1039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1039.439s)

and it's why if you look at you know human history until like the thing we call civilization only started 10 10 13 000 years ago but we have 200 or 300 000 years of sapien existence of people that were genetically and neurologically similar to us and those groups never got beyond give or take what's called the [1060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1060.0s)

[[dunbar number]] 150 people in a tribe and it's like why was that such a hard upper bound why did for hundreds of thousands of years humans never make groups bigger than that and it's actually like the the simplest way i think of it is uh it had to do with limits of coordination so communication and coordination if the [1081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1081.039s)

tribe has to make a decision that's very consequential to move or not or to change some deep aspect of how they do things up to about that size everyone can participate in a tribal council and all have a say in what the rest of their life is going to be subject to [1097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1097.679s)

but as soon as you start getting more people than that everyone can't actually have a say because you can't just you can't have time to listen to a thousand people right it would take a month to make a decision on anything and no one would even have the work memory to hold it and so then i'm have to rep pick representatives to [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1117.2s)

make choices on my behalf now my life is subject to choices that i don't have a say in no i'd rather cleave and make my own smaller group and be more self-determined and so the denmark number was a limit of how and up to that size i could talk to everyone and get their sense made things so i didn't just have it's like [1140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1140.0s)

an anonymous the right or the left over there that i could just have a pejorative straw man version of i had people that i knew intimately so um that's almost all of evolutionary history now when the tribe would get as big as it could get then it would cleave and some of the people would move somewhere else lots of migration happened until [1161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1161.679s)

eventually population keeps growing we've migrated everywhere that we can now population keeps growing and tribal warfare becomes pressed right because now we're competing for scarce resource now there's a basis to have tribes unify against larger external tribes and we call that kind of the beginning of civilization which means it was in a war game theoretic kind of context and so now we unify together and try to create government structures for these larger numbers of people because we have to and so there's binding energy to hold the cleaving energy associated with an enemy hypothesis um so cajun [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1198.0s)

sure so when i think of coordination it feels like it's still related to connection and and if if you want to take it further maybe empathy right when when people don't have a sense of each other or where they're at or what the pain and problem is people don't really care like you know if you know i really care about something daniel and you might be like oh you should meet this person and that could change my life right you might you might give me 10 minutes you might give me an hour you you might help but it feels like it starts that [1241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1241.76s)

coordination starts with some sort of connection um yeah that came up for me so it's a nice feel uh i mean there definitely needs to be some fealty and it's a nice idea that it emerges from empathy it doesn't have to emerge from empathy it can emerge from a shared enemy which it often does [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1264.48s)

and so then there's fealty to each other not because we necessarily care about each other but because we care about ourselves and our sub in group and we feel that we have to be bound with them against whoever the out group is but yeah the [[dunbar number]] was partly a limit on how many relationships i could deeply [1282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1282.559s)

track and i'm willing to make certain sacrifices of what i want most for people i really know and love and i've known forever and i see every day and they know me it's much harder to make sacrifices for anonymous people that i have no idea who they are that are somewhere else right [1299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1299.12s)

and um so as you get beyond that you have to have a shared religion or patriotism or some kind of a group identity that everyone gets to be part of so that they i they identify with each other through shared group identity right we can see that in the us that has broke down where there's very little sense of what it means to be a [1320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1320.559s)

u.s citizen that everyone's on the same page with it really creates binding energy there's much more of a sense of what it means to be on the left or the right it has so much enmity towards each other that the thinking as a whole doesn't have something like shared nationalism or patriotism and that's part of the issue [1336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1336.48s)

i guess so fundamentally do we do humans just need pain or an enemy need to really come together in and coordinate in a in a larger way at scale it's a good question and i think i'll better be able to answer it if we go back to the train it was on about coordination so if we look at all of the issues we want all this coordination issues because we say well no [[climate change]] not a coordination issue it's a straightforward environmental issue we've got to do certain things with the uh transportation and the energy sector or whatever no it's a coordination issue because you [1391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1391.12s)

have to have enough people that have a shared world view around what is true what is real what the problem is that they can come up with adequate solutions and that a major chunk of humanity isn't fighting against them to keep it from happening because they have a different worldview or different assessment right [1411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1411.2s)

and let's say that your solution involves whatever some kind of carbon tax or something that countries have to agree to and uh agreement without enforcement ends up being a very tricky thing and how do you do enforcement internationally um with superpowers that have nukes so let's say that the u.s and europe were to agree to [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1432.159s)

some kind of taxation policy which decreased their near-term gdp growth but was good for the environment long-term and we don't all say well that makes sense but then let's say china doesn't and we have a concern about china seeking to be a global dominant empire and if we can't enforce them to because does that what enforcement mechanisms [1450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1450.48s)

are we going to use that don't create war then does that just basically and that increased gdp and that be that they have relative to everyone else equals increased globalization and military powers are we just ceding the control of the world to china like that's a very real set of theory of trade-off considerations so your assessment of [[climate change]] can't be separate from your assessment of geopolitics and underlying economics and so we don't assess the problems in a deep enough interconnected enough way to come up with good solutions and we don't have enough uh shared [[sensemaking]] that enough of the world wants to do the same things right so we can what do you mean by what do you what do you mean by specific what's that mean what is actually real is [[climate change]] at all right so if you talk to some environmentalists like very good ones like lovelock it's not only real but it's already too [1511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1511.279s)

late there's nothing we can do about it and the earth will become uninhabitable uh other people say it's a very serious thing it's on its way to that but we still have time there are other people that think that it's a real thing but it's not that serious the earth changes will migrate and there are other people [1526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1526.48s)

think it's utter hoax right [[sensemaking]] have we been able to make sense of the world that we live in well enough to inform what we think are right choices so when we think about democracy what we're talking about is a collective choice making system how do we not just make choice me as an individual in my family or an individual economic [1547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1547.12s)

actor choosing to buy or sell something but we're going to share roads we're going to share defense we're going to decide that it does make sense to start that war or not so in autocracy we just basically the power is ceded to whoever it is that's going to make that choice but in a [[participatory governance]] we're supposed to [1567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1567.039s)

participate to do collective choice making the basis of choice making collective choice making is collective [[sensemaking]] about what we think is actually happening and [[sensemaking]] about what we think the effect of a particular injunction might be and [[meaning making]] what do we think is important that we're in service to and [1586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1586.08s)

communication our ability to converse effectively enough with each other that we can get on the same page about this so that we can do collective choice making so voice making has as its antecedents [[sensemaking]] as its prerequisites [[sensemaking]] [[meaning making]] and communication and just to jump into [1604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1604.96s)

[[sensemaking]] i you're reminding me of uh thinking of an ecology right and and there's usually a keystone species of that you could kind of like point out that and be like for example in colombia the jaguar the jaguars health is great the amazon's good if it's if it's not amazon's bad right it's a very simple way so if we think of [1632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1632.48s)

sentence making as a term you you mentioned earlier which is beautiful in information ecology where you take this information ecology and make sense of it how is is there something as simple as a keystone species where you could just be like yeah we're that the health of our [[sensemaking]] right now it's it's fundamentally on the decline it's not healthy um is there is there something that we can point out that or or many things that we can point out where we're like guys our [[sensemaking]] abilities often and in this model you described it's it's almost like the reminds me of the the story of the the princess and the p right this [1684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1684.24s)

she's she's sleeping on a piece she's so sensitive that if a pee is under her bed it affects her right and so there's this music almost a butterfly effect a better better approach of if if this is off right how can we show people that this [1709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1709.12s)

is off or that it's not i think that would should be a helpful place for us to start music so i appreciate that as i'm sharing things individual things i'm saying are sparking in interest and you're wanting to go down those um avenues but i also noticed that about [1729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1729.84s)

six strands of bin which would actually be necessary to close to do a good job of this looking at things in a more interconnected way means the chunk size is a little harder and that's the important thing for people to understand is that you can't fit a good assessment of anything into a tweet [1750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1750.159s)

or into a short news bite so an attention span forgive me when attention spent through downtown you become a worse sense maker for sure because you you have to compress the complexity of reality into something that will fit into the tiny attention and so actually expanding attention to be able to hold [1770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1770.159s)

multiple views multiple epistemologies all of the relevant things so that you can then come up with a solution that's actually adequate as is requisite so i uh i have heard the is there a butterfly effect to affect [[sensemaking]] let me try to close a couple of loops that maybe we'll bring it together so we want to improve human coordination [1796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1796.88s)

we want to improve our [[sensemaking]] where we all are better at having the capability of doing assessment of what is actually true [[base reality]] and you can see in the us right now hydroxychloroquine is a wonder drug it's an utter false forest that actually kills more people if they use it uh [1817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1817.919s)

masks really help masks make it worse systemic racism is this most critical issue in the nation systemic racism isn't even a thing in police violence violence when statistically corrected is worse for white people uh on and on right um china is trying to become a globally dominant empire it's very close or they're not like there's maximally polarized views around just [[base reality]] because these aren't these aren't values these are is this is something true right so clearly we are not doing a good job at collective sensement um so when we say we want to get collective [1858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1858.72s)

coordination we want to get our ability for for everyone to actually know what is true empirically well for us to be able to identify what values we're trying to serve and be able to hear the value someone else is trying to serve and say is are there better strategies that can serve these simultaneously [1875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1875.2s)

maybe i care about the environment here maybe you care about your kids being able to get good jobs and there's a particular proposition that's crafted in a way where if it goes through your kids get good jobs and the environments and vice versa so i have to pretend like i don't arab kids getting good jobs you have to pretend like you don't care [1893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1893.84s)

about the environment because the proposition is based on that theory of trade-offs and i've now collapsed my values into a strategy to achieve them but if i said wait wait i care about this you care about that is there a better proposition we can come up with for what could achieve both both of them so we separate the value from the [1910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1910.799s)

strategy to achieve it you can see that it almost seems mind-boggling it's bogglingly ridiculous that we have a democracy where you vote on a proposition where you weren't involved in crafting what is a good proposition so some special interest group that has a very [1929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1929.12s)

narrow interest puts forward a proposition and markets it to a group of people where it's directly beneficial to them and this is why almost every proposition gets about half the vote yes and have to vote no which also means that it inherently polarizes the population which is why democracies die younger one of the [1946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1946.48s)

main reasons is it's actually very hard to get lots of people to coordinate it's very easy to have one person rule or a small number of people rule and if you're creating a voting system where the people people aren't doing good proposition creation first it is necessarily polarizing [1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1963.679s)

because the thing that you're voting for seems like it's actively trying to harm what is meaningful and sacred to me and vice versa so um since the beginning of the thing we call civilization very few total people have lived in democracies or republics almost everybody has lived in feudalism [1986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=1986.0s)

or autocracy of some kind democracies have emerged just a few times in rare little pockets and when they've emerged they have emerged following periods of [[cultural enlightenment]] this is a really key insight the [[cultural enlightenment]] because it's gonna come to your butterfly effect [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2002.48s)

yeah so the athenian democracy with all of its flaws still a movement in the direction of more [[participatory governance]] emerged out of a kind of greek enlightenment that valued everyone's ability to do better [[sensemaking]] so let's really value education and the development of the individual so everyone should learn [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2025.519s)

history and formal logic and grammar and um rhetoric and etc so they can all actually make sense of [[base reality]] on their own and make good choices and then they all also need the socratic method which means that they can argue any point they can take other people's perspective well and you can see how profoundly broken down that capacity and that value and [2044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2044.88s)

orientation currently is if you have a bunch of people that can make sense of reality directly on their own not listen to what some authorities said and decide which of the authorities they listen to but direct empirical capacity and then they can take each other's perspective those people can have a conversation that will end up [2061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2061.52s)

resulting in some ability for effective compromise and movement forward but if the capacity for sense-making conversation breaks down then the basis that gave rise to the democracy republic being able to emerge breaks down and so we can see that in the u.s the u.s came out of the european [2082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2082.56s)

enlightenment where there was this kind of renaissance idea you don't just have to be a specialist at one thing you can have a deep background in lots of things science we can actually empirically all get a good base understanding of reality and the hegelian dialectic will always seek for any thesis [2099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2099.76s)

an antithesis and then a higher order synthesis can we take multiple perspectives and try to find higher order reconciliation that the underlying [[public education]] and [[fourth estate]] or news that are required for people to all be developed in their capacity to make make sense of the world and participate in [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2118.56s)

governance and to know what's going on have went through enough institutional decay that nobody really has a sense of what's going on or to the degree they do they're outraged and certain about things that half the population thinks that they're desperately wrong about right that they're outraged and certain about uh so we can look at this as the collapse of the american empire because you don't have the ability for a real republic because you don't have participatory governments because the prerequisites aren't there so look at it in a bigger way which is we can and this will then wrap up we can look at at the breakdown of the rope the first ever globalized world order that has been since world war ii because of course empires got larger as time went on and there was a game theoretic competition for more size british empire was not quite a world ruling empire um but after world war ii it was the first time that we could [2177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2177.119s)

never have a war again between the major empires we always had war between major empires but they never had a nuke they never had utterly catastrophic tech that made a war that no one could win and so after world war ii we had to do something unprecedented and say how do we never have a war between the major [2195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2195.359s)

parties again and so we said well we have to be so economically interdependent that it's never advantageous to bomb each other because it is better to coordinate with each other and so let's do globalization and have [[supply chain|supply chains]] that interconnect us in such a way that we don't survive without import and [2212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2212.88s)

export well in a way that made sense right and we had proxy wars but we didn't have major wars from until now but it also created one glo global civilization really because none of the nations really can operate on their own a global civilization mediated by globalism that is profoundly fragile [2234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2234.079s)

where breakdown you know a virus in one part of the world can become a virus in the entire world can start breaking down [[supply chain|supply chains]] breaking down social fabric within countries between countries and so covid was just a big enough thing to show the systemic fragility and the systemic fragility that's been cascading is really like the second and [2252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2252.48s)

third order effects are really just starting to show up and we'll continue for some time and obviously when we look at the social tension that has that arose with george floyd it was a long-term issue but after a tremendous amount of unemployment of course there's going to be more likelihood for violence in the [2269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2269.52s)

street when people's fundamental needs aren't met you always get more willingness for violence and so even that was one of the secondary effects of coveted type effects so what we're experiencing right now also is that the globalized world order that the kind of [[bretton woods]] agreements put in place are breaking down or almost totally broken u.s has pulled out of nato at who decreased the u.n and the major empires the the biggest countries in the world are doing cyber attacks on each other and espionage and they know it so it's not following peacetime agreements it's basically unconventional war rather than [2312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2312.4s)

conventional kinetic war but it can all right hang tight and conveniently getting uh so we have a breakdown of the global order and we have a breakdown of a country and uh leading the global order simultaneously and then we have a very big question of so what happens now uh wade davis do we [2329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2329.52s)

have together increasing chaos facilitated by population reduction [[catastrophic risk]] we're at large do we have china to build trains all around the world and ports and whatever and they run the world and what does that look like or at the end of where the the u.s [2351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2351.839s)

has decayed to can we reboot something like a meaningful [[participatory governance]] if you were to want to reboot it you have to drive a [[cultural enlightenment]] that is the prerequisite this is the butterfly is the high value on everyone's capacity to do much better [[sensemaking]] and much higher quality conversation so they can participate i think this is the exact conversation i want you and wade to to kind of discuss and digest and that was um that was beautiful thank you um yeah do you how are you feeling do you want to take a [2406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2406.72s)

take a breath how about we all take a breath and then we'll we'll come back with weight sure okay great i i think we're it's almost like you've opened the connection of of where both of you really really fit in together and i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from and i'm excited music really really fit in together and i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from and i'm excited music really really fit in together and i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from and i'm excited music hey everyone keep uh keep hanging out for a sec we're trying this uh this new thing where we uh beam the zoom call onto the inside of the playa alchemist uh pyramid here [2542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2542.079s)

uh we'll get it straightened out in just a moment really really fitting together and um i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from and i'm excited music really really fit in together and i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from and i'm excited music music really really fit in together and i think now the audience gets both of you really well where you're coming from um and i'm excited to bring us all together and see uh let's do what emerges all of us thank you too for being here this feels like such a poignant conversation this time from what i find interesting about the two of you is that you guys are pointing at i think something very similar you're stumbling on it in two different [2665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2665.2s)

ways you're coming at it from two different angles wade cultural anthropologist storyteller and and you wrote this article you you shared with me and so forth expanded just you just feel like something had to be said yeah i mean i just was going to say that you know you introduced me to daniel when we first connected and uh i just loved listening to him and uh when i was just listening to the your conversation it struck me that uh just how important it is to know history you know um if you i was just reading earlier today one of the classic [2707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2707.92s)

um books uh about vietnam by stanley karnoff and and you know you just you just see how those those those men you know robert mcnamara and you know dean rusk and and johnson and and all all their kind of various advisors the scores of them were just stumbling around in that void doing what they tried to do [2730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2730.72s)

and and and it's almost agonizing to to be reading the contemporary accounts of their [[decision making]] in 1963 to four to five knowing what was going to be the result and and uh the the the kind of analysis that daniel just did taking us through the patterns of [2751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2751.44s)

history you know if you know he quoted churchill and another one of i think churchill's saying i think it was churchill who said that you know if you don't know if you don't study history you'll never um you know you'll it'll um uh you're condemned to repeat the same mistakes over and over and over [2771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2771.52s)

and you know in in my little analysis the covet thing what made it i suppose unique and certainly what caused it to hit a nerve it's just the point of view you know the kind of the anthropological lens that i was thinking of this less as a story of medicine than of culture and but but daniel takes us to a whole another level of depth [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2793.839s)

right and and and it raises the issue of how astonishing the important knowledge of history is for anyone who who has the audacity to think that they can lead us or lead anyone right and and when you it's not trivial um [2814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2814.0s)

you know that george patton knew classical uh warfare of of the greeks and the metropolitan you know the mediterranean zone it's not an accident that churchill won the nobel prize for literature and wrote more books than most contemporary politicians have read and when you think of the most [2835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2835.839s)

horrifying aspect of many horrifying aspects of the of the current administration in washington it was you know the word ignorant is is really means without knowledge lack of gnosis right and and when you have a president who literally doesn't know when world war ii began you know who doesn't know [2859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2859.599s)

um the most fundamental aspects of history who who has never read anything who famously doesn't read and then when you you contrast that to what we just heard from daniel you know um unraveling the threads of history the mystic connections of history that have brought us to where we are it [2882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2882.559s)

just my overwhelming impression listening to him is just how important how vital a knowledge of his history is um in the moment and certainly for those who who have the um the gumption and and the audacity to believe that they have the right to lead the rest of us and interesting as you're saying that i [2906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2906.559s)

was thinking about what you were speaking of of is this asian century will it be chinese-led and xi jinping is a very serious scholar of history political uh theory philosophy military history um my understanding is uh actually a very serious translator and scholar of all of the kind of classic chinese works um and that when he came to power the people who were in high positions of the ccp all had to have a pretty high degree of background and training in uh the 36 strategies and the art of war and warring states region and you can imagine if [2952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2952.72s)

the u.s senate and congress all had to have the whole kind of history of western philosophy in the canon and the napoleonic wars and alexander the great and etcetera would be a different story and kind of the founding fathers did it right and this is one of the institutional things is that [2970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2970.24s)

when you when you're trying to emerge you have to work really hard but there's a way of kind of getting fat when you are the dominant empire and you've forgotten the problems and the very hard work of staying actively educated and engaged doesn't seem immediately eminently necessary and that's one of the things that leads to the decay [2989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=2989.76s)

i think that's so true i mean you know the famous quick tip by kennedy when he welcomed all the nobel laureates to the white house and he said there wasn't as much in intellectual firepower in that room since the last time thomas jefferson died alone and i think that's so true i mean i you know there's a there's an understandable but a kind of a disturbing american almost embrace of ignorance you know there's a you know if you if you know too much you're sort of you know you're not really a man or something uh there there's a there's a there's a cert certainly we're we're um you know until 9 11 the vast majority of congressmen didn't even own passports and one of the one of the things that i've note besid um uh lecture on private jet trips for the national geographic that would go around the world and they were very very expensive trips for people and generally the the the individuals [3049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3049.2s)

who came along were really wonderful people very very affluent by definition and they had all had incredibly successful careers but their careers had focused on on you know making the most hospital beds or something or making them running this corporation and being a real expert on packaged meats or something like that but outside of that expertise outside of golf football and sports there just wasn't it wasn't as if um a general in for education was deemed to be that essential to to corporate affairs i mean i i used to go through this with my own father-in-law who was who was very well [3094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3094.96s)

read compared to normal politicians but he was a a and most beloved man the most wonderful man the great greatest the embodiment of everything that american a great american is in my opinion but he was senate foreign relations committee chairman uh almost president he was offered the [3113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3113.04s)

vice presidency by richard nixon and he turned it down i supported rockefeller and you know yet you know when he came to visit us at our fish camp in northern british columbia guidebook in hand he came over to me and said wade did you know canada was the second biggest country on earth [3133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3133.119s)

and uh and then he was very desperate to have a newspaper and that the nearest newspaper we could get for him was a four day old copy of the toronto globe and mail it's a bush pilot brought in and granddaddy's sitting there by the fire very very content with the newspaper at last but then he quizzically [3151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3151.839s)

he looks at me pulls down the newspaper and looks up from his bifocals and said wait why is there so much news on canada in this newspaper and and those are kind of um not gentle gentle cliches and uh and obviously granddaddy at that point was past his prime so i'm not being in any [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3175.839s)

but there is there is this um that this this this sense that to know too much is to be almost suspect in the united united states and i don't think that was certainly true in the kennedy era maybe they thought they knew too much in the case of someone like mcnamara but but certainly you know you know not knowledge of the [3197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3197.76s)

world has never been a credential for political office in the united states i'll share a couple thoughts on um partly how i think we got here and it's by no means a uh comprehensive addressing because i there's i think there's actually quite a few threads that are involved what makes someone particularly good in [3222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3222.88s)

the market and what makes them comprehensively educated about history don't necessarily overlap all that well and doing very well in the market means that you can influence dc to have people do your bidding and the people who are susceptible to do that will do better and whatever so [3239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3239.359s)

there's a whole bunch of other reasons but a couple reasons that maybe are slightly less often thought about and valuable one is uh i think the focus on in the types of knowledge that mattered coming out of world war ii made a very drastic shift to stem focus because of the critical role that technology played in the war [3260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3260.0s)

and we can see that it was like we built the entire manhattan project around oppenheimer and like a few people who had really asymmetric technological and physical insights and bletchley park around and you know a couple major things around touring and von neumann that pretty much determine the war right like [3280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3280.4s)

the bomb and the computer and so and then synthetic rub yeah that's a third example and and sputnik uh getting there first i think there was this very real sense of and one way to look at world war ii was the competition between the us and the russians for the german scientists um and not just you know so operation paper clip here and the [3307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3307.52s)

russian version of it there's the famous joke that who would win the cold war between the ussr and usa was who got the better nazi scientists um but like it played a significant role but i think there became a very heavy focus and let's focus on stem but george washington said it should be the primary aim of this government to train every single citizen in the science of government and the science of government meant history politics [[game theory]] courtier dynamics etc because if they didn't understand it those who did would run everything and [3343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3343.359s)

it wouldn't be it would become a kleptocracy and then an oligarchy or some weird thing not a democracy so i think the civics training became very de-emphasized that's one part the other part i think is very important is and this is so i'm gonna i'm gonna say something that i think is more sympathetic with the anti-intellectual movement because i [3365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3365.28s)

think the anti-intellectual movement was a game theoretic counter strategy to intellectualism used as a political weapon and things can be true that are not representative of the whole truth right like one of the things i see all the time is people say well obviously [3384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3384.4s)

herbs and supplements and peptides don't really work that well because there aren't that many phase three clinical trials showing that they work and there are four pharma meds well there's no money because there's no patentability on any of those things of course they'll never get phase three trials and the phase three trials that [3399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3399.76s)

showed that premarin worked or vioxx work didn't mean that they didn't kill massive numbers of people because what's included in the scope of the safety analysis and so it's true those pastry clinical trials are true and if you are literate you understand they're true but they're not representative right because [3416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3416.24s)

if here's the whole space of possible health interventions the ones that are profitable will get the most research and they represent this space so you then the preponderance of data is an uneven distribution right so similarly i can put an ipcc together and say all of the stuff on [[climate change]] but it doesn't rep but [3434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3434.4s)

dc is still running the benign china hypothesis and not looking at that particular issue seriously bannon was actually a big part of you know and trump delivering the us from the benign china hypothesis so there was a way that i see that throughout history whenever something becomes a source of legitimate [3451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3451.92s)

authority whether it's the church or academia then there's so much power in being the one who said says what is true that then anyone who's very good at the game of power has a maximum incentive to try to capture and influence that legitimate authority so the legitimate authority starts getting influenced by [3471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3471.04s)

who's funding it and how the prestige networks work and those types of things so then legitimate authority in the u.s started to have a particular set of political biases that a lot of people in the us didn't feel represented their interests well and so but they couldn't argue against the ipcc thing well but they could feel like it was not [3492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3492.64s)

aligned with their interests so anti-intellectualism since they couldn't compete at it was actually their counter weapon i just won't engage with the weapons that you're using that feel like they're against me and so one of the ways i think to actually have [[sensemaking]] really be able to be pervasive is that it is not weaponized for partial [3512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3512.24s)

political or economic agendas that it is authentically seeking to understand the entire space and be in the benefit of everyone as opposed to that as a virtue signal otherwise i think the anti-intellectualism becomes a natural counter weapon music let me ask you about china because one of the things that um [3530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3530.559s)

uh it was interesting in the criticism of my article um i was i was a number of people jeffrey sachs for one a friend of mine who founded code pink you know quite liberal individual we're very critical of my last paragraph when i essentially said we'll miss the american era if china is in control and i cited in [3555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3555.359s)

that the treatment of the ubers like the social contracts um social capital thing and just the treatment of democracy etc and uh there's a sort of thing on the left that we're now bashing china and i is that the left being reflexively countered with whatever trump is doing because trump's bashing china therefore [3578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3578.319s)

we shouldn't pass china and then you parse it down and you see that jeffrey sachs is up to his you know eyeballs in contracts with the chinese government um and i know that in my travels around the world i've seen the footprint of china virtually everywhere i mean just if you can build your way to [3597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3597.2s)

the dominance that's what they're doing i mean the police station in rortonga the opera house in dakar an interchange in togo in in lomme the capital of togo i mean obviously the the the the belt initiative but also great roads across the amazon and um and i'm i'm [3616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3616.96s)

and i've also of course seen firsthand and what has happened to tibet and there seems to be this thing as long as china does development work it's you know there's build stuff that somehow it's okay and that they're not you know and that gets back in this whole thing where genocide is universally condemned but ethnicity the [3636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3636.24s)

destruction of people's life is not only not condemned is considered proper development policy in in many quarters so what is the what is your sense of china in the next century yeah it's such a critical question um i don't claim to know what's in xi ji ping's mind or what the internal plans and [[sensemaking]] of the ccp are and nor do i represent that whatever those are represents the actual will of all the chinese people outside of beijing um which it obviously doesn't uh let me just sort of interrupt daniel but you're so right in that i mean there is a terrible tendency in the west to see china as this monolith when in fact of course it's remarkably [3687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3687.2s)

diverse ethnically uh vast country vast numbers of people vast orientations and so on i'm sorry go ahead i'm not going to say that there aren't some people who have a xenophobic racist relationship just because it seems big and scary and [3706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3706.72s)

they don't like the big scary things so they make it the chinese monolith of course there is some reactive non-thinking part of that i wouldn't say that that is much dumber than the benign china the hypothesis was i would say those are kind of equally not clear assessments um i think the hundred year marathon is a particularly interesting book around [3726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3726.24s)

china's long-term plan starting in give or take 1949 and it is kind of tracking quite well uh i i think i think we've had a period where nobody remembers in their own lived experience very serious war in the developed world and so they don't really have any embodied sense that that's even a thing so they're [3751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3751.359s)

their actual sense of history is quite bad right like their embodied sense is quite bad and so they they don't recognize that like slavery and genocide and initiating war and empire has been kind of the story for the whole history of civilization everybody like it's not just been european white slavery it was the [3772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3772.64s)

you know the ottomans and turks enslaving europeans it was people in asia in slavery inter asian slavery it was uh you know command command g violence with other first tribes people like largely humans have just been kind of violent for a long time often and that's an important part of [3791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3791.92s)

the story so when we say the us was built on genocide and slavery and how can it have any kind of moral value that's a very real story and like what do we do for reparations on genocide and slavery and the whole world was in a context of slavery and genocide arguably you could say british colonialism was less [3811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3811.039s)

violent than dutch or spanish or some of the other colonialisms you go to the congo and whatever in some ways so this is why the historical context is important and so then i'm going to think of china in light of that if i put myself in my imagining of xi's position i'm actually quite empathetic [3828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3828.72s)

to everything he's doing and in some ways i can say it's the smartest thing anyone in the world is doing because there are some critical problems that it appears he's paying attention to that no one else is even paying earnest attention to so i'm very empathetic to the solutions he has that doesn't mean i like the solutions or want them to happen [3846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3846.48s)

so just to kind of briefly frame that rule of law requires monopoly of violence if you don't have a monopoly of violence how do you enforce this rule of law if we say you can't cut down the parks but the dudes who are cutting down the trees have bigger guns than the police do then you can cut down the parks right well how do you have monopoly of [3865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3865.52s)

violence when individuals or small groups can make catastrophic weapons that can destroy whole cities and whatever because [[exponential tech]] makes that possible where i can get access to crispr gene drives and people in their basement can make bio weapons or uh you know drones with thermite bombs [3881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3881.839s)

that are like easy to make that can take out massive aspects of infrastructure this problem of i can do way more damage with an ar-15 than a knife but i can do way more damage with a crisper gene drive than an ar-15 and it was very hard to make nukes i needed [[nation state]] capacity to make nukes but i don't need nation-state capacity to [3904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3904.24s)

make drone weapons and so we have an emerging world where decentralized or cyber weapons that can take out infrastructure we have a place where decentralized [[exponential tech]] makes the world frail in a way that there's no precedent in all of history for this is why we need history and we also [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3924.4s)

need imagination right and forecasting um and so what do we do about that what do we do when people can in their basement not just be going crazy and getting an ar-15 with a lot of clips but they can be building crisper weapons china's answer is there is no answer other than ubiquitous surveillance you need a bit of surveillance to be able to suppress a harm that is that great and the harm of the suppression is less bad than the harm of doing that thing and uh that's actually kind of understandable right and they're also not in the position of seeing that the the us [3962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3962.16s)

as having been as like innocent and rosie as a lot of people in the u.s do because from the outside the predatory debt lending they've been doing all over the world for the last 20 years we were doing for a lot longer than that they just kind of took world bank model copied it and made it better um the wars that we waged whatever so [3977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=3977.119s)

i'm very empathetic to why china is doing what it's doing and i'm actually very impressed with its ability to build high-speed trains all around the world when we can't fix roads right um a talk rarely see actually autocracy with no term limits so you can do 100 year planning with no internal coordination costs is an amazing system to build that said i think if anyone who's concerned about racism in the us doesn't look at the chinese treatment of the uigar and take very seriously what is its actual view towards racial justice like demonstrably and if the way we're dealing with it in the us is leading to increasing division of the us which leads to the rapidity of its breakdown which is ceding the 21st century to chinese ai technologically empowered autocracy with that [[value system]] are we just being short-sighted as about actual racism over the next century or any other issue like that [4036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4036.4s)

i think she also has paid attention to [[civilizational collapse]] better because he also has a longer history right china has a much longer history and so he knows that [[civilizational collapse]] happens because you get overthrown externally you have internal descent or you run out of resources so he's worked to have a hundred year resource acquisition plan which belton road and and pearls and whatever are part of the sesame credit system and the iot surveillance system ensures that internal descent can't happen and an adequate military ensures that nobody can be overthrow them without [[catastrophic risk]] to themselves [4072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4072.4s)

but any people should think about how do i prevent our own people from going through [[civilizational collapse]] so like i'm simultaneously very empathetic with and want answers really better than those answers well there's another there's another thing that i think that people in the west um fail to understand is just the um the [4094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4094.64s)

the reflex for order it goes back to the whole confucian um ideology um and you realize what china has actually endured over the last 150 years not just the humiliation leading to the boxer rebellion but you know the great leap forward which led to 48 million people dying of starvation [4116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4116.64s)

the chaos of the cultural revolution what 35 million people died in the civil war and world war ii i mean i mean it's no wonder the chinese citizenry is perfectly happy with the stability that the social credit system is invoking i mean the polls say that chinese [4140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4140.719s)

people like it because they just want order predictability i wouldn't say i could trust those polls because of the credit system if there's a self-reform dynamic right of course my sense is from what i have heard of people who have lived and spent a lot of time throughout various regions of china is that the further you get in actual miles outside of beijing the less kind of ccp standard narrative people hold and it's large enough that as powerful as the ccp is it still can't unify one point whatever it is five eight billion people we think the number's probably a lot higher than the [4185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4185.279s)

reported number all that well like that's a that's a hard thing to do and this actually one of my concerns is i i think the benign china hypothesis of like no china is just trying to grow its people they're not trying to become a world empire don't worry about it is completely [4200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4200.4s)

dreadful but also chinese or the great bad guys is the only thing that could unify by all of china against the west right because the people who are there like louis vuitton and they like silicon valley and they like hollywood but they won't if the message they keep hearing is that americans don't like the chinese [4219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4219.36s)

i really want to separate the view of the chinese from a particular regime well there's a whole issue of faith and and uh um and you know which comes the job the motherland of the motherland and uh no that's fascinating i i you should write a book about this we've got 23 books professor then i have none so my best [4253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtkUJPg7os&t=4253.12s)
