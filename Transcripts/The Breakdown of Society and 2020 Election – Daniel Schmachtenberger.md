music if you think about the upcoming us elections right now i would say that we're in a situation that is unprecedented in the history of all of our lifetimes and pretty much unprecedented history of the nation is everyone has always felt that presidential elections are consequential maybe they've even felt that they're [16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=16.32s)

more consequential than they really are and they get passionate about it but right now the percentage of the population that thinks that it's not just consequential this election but is existential to the republic itself is very high like it's a very high percentage of the population that think the way this election goes will be either the end of the nation or the possibility of it to continue on both sides right so like to really get a sense the trump supporters feel that trump is the only thing standing between the republic being protected and the people being protected at all and a kind of globalist deep state cabal taking everything over in a finalizing way and [52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=52.8s)

running the benign china hypothesis like they did in dc since the 70s and basically ceding control of the world to china and that kind of thing the the never trumpers think that if trump gets in he will eviscerate the last elements of a republic and create a dynasty kind of for his family and chosen people to run it like [71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=71.76s)

they both think that it's the end of the republic if the other guy gets in and they both think the other side is going to steal it they're set up to actually think that there isn't election security it's going to be stolen so what happens when the election comes and it's not held as valid and it's held as existential and we have these mounting [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=89.36s)

tensions already that were there with kovid because of lockdown lockdown means more news cycle to take all the stuff in right and then also it means radically increasing unemployment and we so when we saw the violence start with george floyd violence was actually bound to start [109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=109.119s)

from some trigger uh when you study kind of the societal um chaos indices the things that would create a basis for societal chaos the more people whose fundamental needs aren't met by a system they become more desperately willing to act against the system and so when you start having massive unemployment that's a very unstable [130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=130.399s)

situation for the overall system and it's going to express itself somehow and no one really has the ability to process any of this well nor are the nor is the reporting oriented to try to process it in an adequate way which is actually a really hard thing to do there's much higher incentive to control a narrative for particular purposes [150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=150.0s)

and so for the most part people have kind of traded epistemology for tribalism meaning given up on trying to do a rigorous job of making sense of things themselves like take a narrative take a q a non-narrative take antifa narrative break it into individual propositions and then look at each of those [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=169.28s)

propositions what evidence do i have to verify it or falsify it maybe neither do i have any evidence that would at least support or refute it do other people interpret that evidence differently go across the whole thing then look at alternate hypotheses nobody does that right like very very few people use formal epistemic process so what [187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=187.76s)

they're really doing is paying attention to what feels true which largely has to do with what people like me kind of seem to think and which team i kind of want to be on and what i'm getting exposed to the most music let's just take a historical perspective for a minute [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=207.04s)

humans have been here for a long time but the thing that we call civilization which was much larger than tribal scale starting to organize early egypt or sumeria or whatever since the beginning of that larger scale coordination a tiny percentage of the people that ever lived lived in something like a republic or [226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=226.08s)

democracy they almost all lived in a feudalism or monarchy or some kind of much more top-down autocratic system which is actually quite easy to understand because the proposition of a republic or democracy a [[participatory governance]] is actually a wild proposition which is that a huge number of people [245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=245.76s)

who don't know each other who want different things can sublimate their desire and difference to coordinate with each other it's like that's actually kind of oh it's understandable that's a hard thing right this is why corporations aren't run that way corporations are autocracies and so the few times throughout history [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=260.959s)

that a republic or a democracy emerged they're actually really kind of worth studying and i'm going to simplify here but it's a fair simplification they emerged following a period of a [[cultural enlightenment]] for that culture and the [[cultural enlightenment|cultural enlightenments]] always had at least a couple things in common so if we look at the [279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=279.04s)

kind of early greek democracies the athenian democracy of course we can criticize that there's a lot that wasn't perfect about it but it was a movement in the direction of more [[participatory governance]] it was following the kind of greek enlightenment that both had a very high value on classical education for everyone [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=296.4s)

let's have everybody learn history let's have them all learn philosophy let's have them all learn formal logic and rhetoric and the arts and these types of things so that everyone can have a sense of how to know the true plus the good and the beautiful right like all of an integrated sense of those understand what types of systems worked [313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=313.52s)

and didn't work in the past because of more kind of knowledge of history so if everyone can basically sense [[base reality]] on their own well which has to be trained right like there's actually training involved in that and then there was also the value of the socratic dialogue and in the socratic dialogue everybody [331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=331.039s)

is being trained to be able to take every perspective i can argue this side then i can move around and argue this side if people are being trained in that kind of dialectical process that means i'm being trained in seeking to understand the perspective of others and actually be able to argue them even better which is steel manning [348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=348.32s)

right well if you have a bunch of people who can all understand reality on their own well and they can have high quality conversations and take each other's perspective not just go into tribalism and otherness and make a villain or a straw man of the other [362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=362.72s)

those people can start to have the kinds of conversations to share [[sensemaking]] that leads to being able to make collective choices and then they don't need rulers and they can say like we can throw the rulers off and do a [[participatory governance]] system the european enlightenment which led to the foundation of the u.s and a reformation of a lot of kind of [380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=380.56s)

european and other [[global governance]] the kind of modern era similarly was the renaissance right the idea that people would be renaissance men or renaissance people who actually train in lots of disciplines not just be specialists because it's very hard if someone's just a specialist to make sense of the world right and or for them to talk to each [399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=399.039s)

other across those specialist languages so the idea of renaissance person and then of natural philosophy and science that we can actually empirically tell what's going on and have the same conversation based on that plus kind of the hegelian dialectic we can seek a thesis and then seek an antithesis and then see is there a [418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=418.479s)

higher order synthesis if people can do that well a town hall is a possible thing in a republic or a democracy or participatory government governance is a possible thing if that starts to break down where people can't actually make sense of reality on their own well so they're taking the [436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=436.08s)

view of authorities who can then be captured because of the power of that and used for power purposes and they can't take the view of other people well they can only basically make strawmen and fight against them there is no possibility for collective choice making which is what a democracy republic's about collective choice making if there's no capacity for collective the right the antecedents of choice making is collective [[sensemaking]] collective [[meaning making]] and collective conversation collective [[sensemaking]] of what's actually going on and what do we anticipate the effects of a particular action to be collective [[meaning making]] of what's important well we're focused on different things that are important can we factor all of them and try to come up with a design solution that is good for all of them right now we don't even have a process in democracy for that we have somebody's focused on something they come up with a proposition to benefit that they don't even think about the [486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=486.56s)

fact that that proposition harms other things because they're focused on the subset of values they're focused on which is why almost no proposition gets a hundred percent or zero percent of the vote it's like 50 because the people who are focused on what it benefits really want it and the people who are focused on what harms [500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=500.8s)

really don't want it that inherently and unavoidably polarizes the population against each other because i see the thing that you are desperately trying to make happen is actively harming the thing that i hold as sacred worth fighting for so i have to hold you as an enemy right but it was because of a dumb proposition [517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=517.039s)

it was because of a proposition that didn't even try to get hey you don't necessarily need that economic thing to go through or that tax policy or that oil policy you need your kids to be able to have an opportunity for a real job and to be able to own a house someday like not be in in economic servitude forever well if i hold just what is the value [535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=535.519s)

without the strategy that's attached to it that contextualizes it having to happen that way i'm like that's fair i economic servitude's a problem and i don't hold that that thing can't go through i hold that we don't want to extinct species in this area you're like i actually like forests [551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=551.92s)

not extincting species would be cool i just i'm willing to do it if that's the only way my kids aren't in servitude forever if we start by taking the what are the values that everyone holds and say is there a proposition that does a better job of meeting these and can we use some collective [[sensemaking]] for collective design well it's like [567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=567.519s)

that's so obvious once you say it and that's not in our democratic process at all but it also requires people that can have a good quality conversation and seek to hear what other people's values are and would want to seek not just the immediacy of war which then of course you never just win forever right you win [584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ9iRByzUJs&t=584.16s)

and the thing that won the other side reverse engineers makes better and comes back and so then you just get an [[arms race]] and an escalation of [[narrative warfare]] info warfare memetic warfare tribalism physical kinetic warfare all of those types of things
