music welcome to the radical brilliance podcast with arjuna arda and brilliant guests from around the world who are contributing to the evolution of humanity today's guest is daniel schmacktenberger who's going to talk to us about how to become an agent of evolution so here's your host arjuna [44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=44.16s)

arda music hey welcome back to the radical brilliance podcast you know when i was writing the book radical brilliance i i drew upon about 420 existing interviews that i had conducted over many many years for different other books [75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=75.36s)

and i did an additional about 30 interviews for radical brilliance so by the time i was done i'd done about 450 interviews and people used to ask okay you've written this book radical brilliance it's about brilliance so who is the most brilliant person you've ever interviewed and you know i never hesitated [97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=97.439s)

very much when people would ask me that question in that way my answer would always be without a moment's hesitation daniel schmacktenberger and you're about to find out why sometimes it feels to me when i talk to daniel about any topic i've talked to about the judicial system about the financial system i've talked [120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=120.0s)

to him about nootropics about nutrition about the way food's grown i've talked about relationships about monogamy about everything um i've spent a lot of time with him i stay frequently at his house and we talk for hours almost any topic i can think of to talk with daniel about it's like [140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=140.56s)

it's like you're transporting 30 or 50 years into the future and speaking with someone with that more evolved perspective it's like speaking to a time traveler and it really goes across the board it's and he actually will even talk about that he will talk about what he calls lateral thinking which means the capacity to take insights from [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=169.04s)

one discipline and apply them to another and i particularly love the conversation we had today because it is about how the the potentially imminent crisis we face not only ecologically but financially in many other sectors as well is actually all determinant on upgrading our thinking upgrading our understanding and many people have pieces of that [198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=198.239s)

puzzled puzzle but there are very few people i know who have an inclusive integral view of that evolution needed in the way that daniel does so i hope you'll really enjoy this conversation with daniel it's quite dense he's a highly intelligent multi-dimensional thinking person i found in many of the conversations i've had with him before i need to go back and listen to the recording several times to fully grok what he was talking about so this is a podcast you might like to uh to just press the rewind a few times and listen to certain parts over and over again to [241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=241.12s)

to really get the full implication of what he's talking about i hope you'll enjoy this please come back be stick around at the end and i'll have some suggestions for you for how to take this particular conversation and turn it into practices that we can use to deepen our radical brilliance in our own day-to-day lives [258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=258.56s)

enjoy music hey daniel thank you so much for sitting down today i'm looking forward to talking about some important things together me too you know to jump right in for a long time there has been an awareness at least among a small subculture that we [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=293.759s)

are potentially heading towards crisis i mean if we if we go all the way back to the 70s people were talking about [[climate change]] then people were talking about you know the nuclear clock the sense of we need to upgrade we need to change our ways has been in the collective for quite a long time however [315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=315.12s)

i've noticed and i'm interested to know if you're aware of this too that in the news in in casual conversation at conferences this is becoming much more now of a mainstream collective conversation hey we have little time left to dramatically change our ways and upgrade the software that we're running together [337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=337.52s)

in being human there's definitely been a increase in awareness of certain phenomena in recent years and even months [[climate change]] and other environmental issues like plastic in the ocean and [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean and [[species extinction]] and biodiversity loss have moved from pretty fringy topics to [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=364.72s)

more widely understood to more widely actually really cared about and sources of concern and add to that significant geopolitical shifts where in recent years large-scale war became a more eminent topic than it had been a long time where [[climate change]] induced refugee crises at [388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=388.72s)

impending huge future scales because you look at how much got destabilized from syria and that that was largely uh kicked off through [[climate change]] through droughts that led to the subsistence farmers not being able to farm moving to the city leading to resource shortages leading to war leading to [408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=408.96s)

refugees and that got brexit that was very involved in the trump election people's views towards refugees here you know et cetera and when we look at the numbers of refugees anticipated over the next decade decade and a half the world has no solutions for it at all and then we add to this things like [425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=425.28s)

[[artificial intelligence]] associated risks [[artificial intelligence]] weapons all the way to real agi scenarios and seeing people like elon musk talking on popular shows as popular as joe rogan saying we're not going to solve this and kind of being given up about it like these are definitely there have been people working in the [449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=449.199s)

airs community for a decade that have had those concerns but they haven't been on joe rogan right like that is a new level of public awareness and it's partly because ai is an [[exponential tech]] and that means that it's growing at an exponential rate it also means that things like [[climate change]] were just getting to thresholds that have been in underway for decades or longer but the threshold points are now becoming eminent so uh yes that's the case that there's more awareness and there is more actual eminence of some of the issues but i would contextualize it slightly differently just because i think it's important so when you were saying back to the kind of 60s and 70s and you know maybe even before if if we think about world war ii in the development of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] as the beginning of humanity having the technology that it could wipe itself out with that was an important point before that we could definitely cause wars and we [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=508.639s)

did for all human history but we couldn't cause a war that could cause nuclear winter right like it took it took an asteroid coming dinosaur level kind of activity for something like that record all of a sudden we became capable of inducing that ourselves and so with that existential level [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=526.32s)

technology we can extinct ourselves became a really new awareness can i just make a comment for a minute because i'm realizing that's true in a kind of quick and dramatic way that grabs people's attention rather like when someone has a gun in the house now they have greater ability to commit suicide but there are other ways that we now [548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=548.8s)

have the ability to wipe ourselves out not just in the in pressing a red button on a nuclear device but through the gradual erosion of of environmental integrity of depletion of resources so that would be analogous to somebody could kill themselves by smoking two packs of cigarettes a day right and it [567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=567.2s)

would be another form of suicide but much slower so they're there i can see that what you're what you're saying about our impact on other species as well as our own survival is true short is true quick and long-term right so let's take let's look at a couple of these key points to understand [583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=583.839s)

now in context because uh history is actually valuable here so world war ii gave us the ability to extinct ourselves quickly that was a new possibility in the whole history of not just our species but all species on this planet as far as we know right none of them ever had the ability to [604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=604.24s)

extinct themselves because of their own technological capabilities that's like whoa we have no evolutionary precedent for this um and so that led to the creation of the united nations to try and say oh obviously world war ii is a sign that we national governments alone aren't enough to stop wars and yet the wars we have now are so [622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=622.48s)

catastrophic in their possibility what do we do and you know the goal there largely was how do we prevent world war iii and how do we do nuclear d proliferation and we i won't get into this now maybe we will later but we obviously have not succeeded in nuclear deep proliferation there's a lot more countries with nukes now [638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=638.959s)

and nukes aren't even the most interesting weapon anymore so but you go back and you see world war one was the first war that was at such significant scale that we could start to taste the eminence of real catastrophe even before we had nukes which is what led to the league of nations where it's kind of failing to prevent world [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=655.76s)

war ii had us changed the name to united nations but but there's a deeper structural level of what leads to war what leads to environmental damage where we go back and we see well humans have done more on environmental damage since the beginning of the thing we call civilization we're just getting much bigger tools to [672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=672.8s)

mediate the ways that we've been so now now let's kind of this is a story that i that i wanted to tie it back to you go back to the dark ages and the idea that armageddon's just around the corner if we think about this mythopoetically so we say okay the rapture story the end of the mayan calendar or the end [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=695.839s)

of the aztec calendar or the hopi end of this cycle or the end of kali yuga and the hindu system going into satyu like they're kind of all the same story so let's take the kind of the purgatory rapture story so the story roughly if we aren't interpreting it literally says this phase of the world doesn't last forever it's going to kind of come to an end and the end is nigh we can see it right and at a certain point as it's kind of coming to an end there's going to be some really hard choices to make this kind of a purgatory period where based on the choices we make and it's not predetermined there's a pretty hard fork in the road [737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=737.36s)

and we end up going one way that looks kind of like terrible for everybody hell in one way that looks like re-entering the garden satyuga the golden age heaven on earth whatever and if you just think about it and from the point of view of just like kind of smart patient people paying attention in the bronze age [757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=757.04s)

and looking around saying hey now that we got metal weapons the wars are way bigger than when we had stone weapons like we just killed way more people from a further distance we got catapults sweet and we these metal tools allow us to cut down trees way faster and now there's deserts in areas there didn't used to be deserts and we're getting bigger ones we're getting better metals down we can kill people from further we can cut down trees faster we can grow populations faster with our agricultural technology this doesn't get to last forever like this increased destructive capacity doesn't get last forever at some point this phase is going to end because we aren't [794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=794.639s)

using our power well like we aren't using our power in a considerable way to the fact that we live on a finite space and so if you think about it it's just like the rapture story is just actually literally true because we have been acting like [[apex predator|apex predators]] but who can increase their predative capacity via tools in ways predators actually can't faster than the environment can become resilient to that increased predative capacity so a great white shark can't become much faster faster than the tuna can become faster and get away it's there's a symmetry [829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=829.68s)

but we can make you think about the fish killing capacity of a great white compared to the fish killing capacity of a of a ocean super trawler right they can pull up hundreds of tons of fish in one that you're like okay we can't actually think of ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] like we can't do that thing anymore because we've broken the power symmetry [850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=850.399s)

through tech so completely and so when you actually look back you say okay the end the end is nigh we need to change the boat right we need to turn the ship around well rome didn't turn the ship around and it fell and the aztec empire and the inca empire and the egyptian empire and the sumerian [869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=869.199s)

empire all have something in common is that they were world ruling world leading empires and they all collapsed there's a book that started this exploration kind of popularly called the collapse of complex societies by tainter and just the first valuable insight about all previous civilizations is that [887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=887.279s)

none of them exist anymore so basically what i'm going to say is that it's not like we need to change the humanity in terms of what's causing [[climate change]] or what's causing potential larger scale wars with ai weapons or that we need to that it's a modern society issue that there is something that has led and [907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=907.839s)

we could get into this if this is where we decide to go there's something that has led to the ways we build civilizations not being sustainable for as long as we've been building civilizations and the difference now is just that we have a global scale civilization and that we're in the verticalizing part of the tech that extends [925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=925.92s)

the capacity of human choices that's great so you've you've just referred to historical precedent on a local scale about how societies have collapsed right rome being a great example and then you gave a number of other parallels which doesn't bode very well for what we're doing globally [946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=946.399s)

do we have any precedent for societies that came close to collapse and actually did successfully turn it around yes and no there are examples where like the mayans the mayan collapse didn't mean there were no mayans left there are still mayans right there are still people who practice mayan influenced ideas but they went from [974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=974.16s)

being a like major city constructing civilization to being small numbers of people back in the woods so they didn't lose everything but they lost most of it so do we call that a success we call it limiting the total extent of catastrophe and if we uh one look at like greece [998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=998.88s)

greece got taken over by rome but at least grecian ideals influenced the roman empire which didn't spread them so it didn't totally die but do we have examples where any of those civilizations change something intrinsic to themselves that then led to enduring sustainability no [1019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1019.44s)

well let me run a couple of examples for you can i do that sure um one i think one big turning point within our predominant civilization would be the renaissance now if you read uh what people were were talking about and writing about soon after the invention the [[printing press]] actually um the whole conversation was about what happens when ships fall off the edge of the fall off the edge of the of the disk you know so there was a whole conversation about that but also because there was the belief that the the all the planets were going around the earth it it [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1057.28s)

it suggested a chaotic out of control deity who just had add right and then so the so actually things were not looking so good in medieval europe there was a lot of despair a lot of a lot of doomsday theory going on then and it was actually copernicus of course and and and and associated things as well as [1081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1081.28s)

ex the the success of exploration which brought on the renaissance so that was a positive uplift for a civilization which i mean it's hard to say if it exactly averted catastrophe but it certainly changed the conversation from predominantly negative to positive and another one let me just throw you [1098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1098.72s)

away and then i'll get your comment is was um post-[[industrial revolution]] in england but before the popularization of the motor car uh london had this massive problem with horses they had i think there were 50 000 horse-drawn cabs i don't know exactly the details but [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1117.84s)

basically they did a calculation the times of london no less in 1884 did this calculation they said based on current trends the entire city was going to be buried under nine feet of horseshit uh by the turn of the century but of course that didn't happen because of the you know because it took a bit longer and then because of the [1134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1134.88s)

popularization of the model t ford yeah so so we do see where things were looking really grim and there was an intervention and if we had paid more attention at the time we could probably have seen that intervention you know because it takes it has in the past taken about 30 years for them to go from an invention to mass [1153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1153.6s)

assimilation so what can we see on the horizon for us today that that could be majorly game changing and game solving these are actually important examples to explore a little bit if we look at the periods that at least standard narrative of history tells us are where some positive upturns happened if we [1178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1178.16s)

look at the greek enlightenment or if we look at the renaissance or the enlightenment that followed it or you know et cetera [[industrial revolution]] itself um wherever we see these meaningful increases in in or changes in direction they correspond to meaningful increases in [1200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1200.4s)

capacity that arose from new insights so as you were mentioning coming out of the dark ages was copernicus kepler galileo you know coming into newton having a new way of understanding reality that was demonstrably more effective you could use newton's calculus to have your cannonball hit the spot [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1219.6s)

better than pendulum dowsing right better than just praying could so those who kind of bought the idea just did better they did better in agriculture they did better in war they so the idea spread because it was effective but that it was a very small number of people who developed fundamentally new insights about the [1236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1236.559s)

nature of reality much in the same way that it was like von neumann and touring and a few people that figured out computation that affects all of our lives or a few people have figured out quantum mechanics that made that possible so there were upticks in understanding there was usually a few people going very deep to say [1252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1252.08s)

the current way we understand reality is inadequate right the dark ages were such a clear example we can't actually solve the problems at the level of consciousness we have right now like we actually need deeper insights so then as we get deeper ontology we get deeper insight about the nature of reality we get new capacities [1268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1268.72s)

so i would say in general that has been a process that whenever there's been a deep doubling down on understanding the nature of reality better that has led to new insights new capacities emerge but at the same time what i would say is that each of those places where then some very positive thing happened a little [1285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1285.12s)

ways down the road some really negative thing came from that new thing that was bigger in scale true and faster and urgent the motor car is such a great example is like horseshit covering london would have been a bummer for london but it wouldn't have possibly been catastrophic for the ability of the biosphere to support humans writ large [1303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1303.76s)

yes and yet cars then were exactly that yeah and so like everybody likes that we have cars and it doesn't take 30 years to get across the country and yet the political destabilization and wars over oil and um and just all of the kind of war political dynamics that are associated and [[climate change]] and ocean acidification and all that are very related to having cars and so and even when you talk about science compared to the religious ideology well so it's like science was super more effective at a lot of things but then also said the nature of reality is objective we end up getting a philosophy that [1342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1342.64s)

emerges with science in most cases which is physicalism what's real is physical stuff that started at the big bang and the constants are what they are for some reason and the laws of physics are what they are for some reason there's no consciousness and at a certain point you get galaxies and then planets and then eventually life and consciousness [1359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1359.2s)

pops out as an [[emergent property]] and if you run that you say well the consciousness couldn't in turn affect the underlying physics brains or causal systems deterministically unfolding so there is no actual choice and you're left with nihilism and then people are like trying to reconcile science with buddhism or [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1377.039s)

some religious idea to try and solve that but again it's one of those places where the solution was adequate for the next step but not adequate long term but as we're getting as as the consequences as we exponentiate are getting faster and faster so we have less time to respond but also being able [1395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1395.679s)

to disseminate faster and faster and be more consequential the process itself has to change rather than just here's the next step we have to actually think better about what will the not currently obviously anticipated effects will the externalized effects be and how do we internalize all of those to the design to the strategy itself [1416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1416.4s)

yeah great that's awesome if you're enjoying this podcast with arjuna aarda and his radically brilliant guest you might also enjoy our eight week online group coaching program it's an opportunity to go deep and get stable in practices that enhance your own brilliance we only take 20 participants at a time [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1453.2s)

so in a small and intimate group you can go through the whole radical brilliance cycle you'll have an accountability partner and another brilliant aspirant from somewhere around the world the eight-week coaching program involves eight one-hour webinars with arjuna aarda and a group of other radical brilliance coaches you'll [1475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1475.52s)

also receive one 30-minute coaching session with your own personal coach every week and one 90-minute coaching session with arjuna himself music it's the ideal opportunity to drop deep into yourself into the source of your own creativity and to get support [1497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1497.44s)

for an entire eight weeks of mining your own radical brilliance and bringing it forth into a project or creation that can truly serve the future of humanity find out more at and click on the programs tab what i'm thinking we might do with that is go from now from collective to individual okay because what you're describing of finding radically different ways to not only to not only arrive at conclusions but the very mechanism of that computation is going to be different so that's probably not going to happen universally all at the same time as a [1542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1542.559s)

wii it's going to happen in certain individuals experimenting and reporting back which may lead then to to a you know to a gradual shift in the same way you know copernicus didn't have to go door-to-door to every household in medieval europe to for galileo to prove his theories and [1559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1559.12s)

for us to be headlong into the renaissance it took a tiny percentage of people so let's go individual for a moment what it's let's imagine that somebody listening to this really felt all i want to do with my life is contribute in the absolutely best possible way i want i'm going to dedicate my life [1581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1581.2s)

to an upgrade and to the best possible upgrade what other what what's the kind of shift that needs to happen on an individual level for someone to become catalyst of evolution beautiful um if you indulge me i would like to say one kind of broad thing first and then [1603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1603.919s)

dive into it because specifically you when you said an individual becoming a catalyst of evolution that's actually very different than our idea in biology of what evolution is and so the idea itself weren't speaking to when we think about what evolution is there are mutations and then some of those mutations lead to dynamics that are adapted in that environment in the moment and so those ones are selected for and two types of selection the that animal survives and it gets to mate if it survives and doesn't mate it doesn't get selected for if it doesn't survive obviously it won't [1643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1643.52s)

get to me so there's mutation and selection and the things that kind of work make it through but if some animal works well but it works so well that it kills all of the prey or it debases its environment so completely then it ends up killing itself too because it has to be part of a self-sustainable environment [1660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1660.399s)

so in evolution what ends up making it through are whole self-stabilizing ecologies because anything else doesn't make it through long term they'll make it to only short term so evolution the way we traditionally think about evolution is that it's a creative process it's a process by which new stuff comes into existence you had giraffes and we [1678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1678.0s)

didn't have drafts before we had you know whatever right because some mutation of longer neck was useful and we kept doubling down on it so it's a creative process but we don't consider conscious that somebody is saying we like some long naked giraffes it was just like the mutation happened and then it [1694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1694.08s)

was adaptive and then it got double down on right it's happening everywhere at once you have kind of mutation occurring everywhere at once and massive parallel processing and almost everything fails most species don't make it through most mutations don't get selected for it all but the few things that do make it [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1711.6s)

through long term are intercompatible with everything else in a way that gives you profoundly complex self-stabilizing holes right okay so we can think of biology and the ecology that way that's one creative process but then there's and this is key to understand our crisis and all the crises we've had [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1728.96s)

there's a second creative process which is [[tool making]] or technology or design that started with homo habilis probably and then got double down on and homo sapien and that is a fundamentally different creative process that we can't call evolution because the spear isn't coming about [1750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1750.559s)

through random mutation somebody consciously understood a principle of sharpness in a different way than the chimp did right the chimp will use a sharp rock to cut something but it doesn't make a sharper rock right and there's a really key difference is that the chimp will experience this rock in in the eminent sense they're [1769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1769.6s)

experiencing that it cuts and they pick up this other rock and it cuts better and they'll use the one that cuts better and if you give it a knife it'll even use that but it won't make the knife because to make a better one you have to understand this rock and this rock and this rock all have something in common which is none of the rocks which is this abstract [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1786.08s)

principle of sharpness yes what is sharpness what makes sharpness how could i make more of it yes oh maybe it has to do with the angle and maybe the hardness of the thing and so that process of abstraction is unique to humans as we understand it again starting give or take homo habilis standard narrative of human history and so or homo sapiens [1805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1805.2s)

i mean as far as we understand it's common to all of the previous kinds of homo before homo sapiens like i'm saying homo habilis is the first tool maker okay that was designing new tools as we best kind of understand it prior to us two and a half million years ago okay way privacy yes okay yeah and [1826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1826.72s)

but that was the beginning of us starting to fundamentally be different than the whole rest of the animal kingdom got it okay and the thing i'm trying to bring about here is that's not evolution anymore yes so those tools are being created consciously yes whereas the mutations that are creating a slightly different [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1845.039s)

animal are being created unconsciously i don't know if you are aware of this but um barbara marx hubbard in at one point coined the term conscious evolution yes to describe exactly what you're saying it's a it's uh it's evolution through its evolution through a kind of conscious design which she talks about as co-creating with the source of everything so you so now human beings are kind of a marriage of an animal evolutionary unconscious [[evolutionary process]] and a kind of divinely inspired ability to create something that wasn't there before okay i yes and i think it's one of the [1881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1881.36s)

most important kind of ideas that uh we can think about barbara has really like advanced that so much and i just want to add some specificity to it yeah so us making tools is not conscious evolution it is a second creative process which is design or tool-making but to just kind of go through the difference [1904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1904.08s)

so evolution like we said is unconscious it's very slow it's massively parallel processed you get mutations everywhere and which ones make it through and then which ones make it through long term is what what ends up making it through right [[tool making]] is actually not decentralized it's centralized inside of [1924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1924.72s)

a single brain that can understand something to be able to make it right or inside of a single tribe that can communicate to each other to be able to make a complex tool but there's actually consciousness involved rather than unconsciousness there's centralization rather than just total [1938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1938.88s)

decentralization so it's more of a serial than a parallel process and it's not trying to make holes it's making parts so we have kind of evolution creating un unconsciously creating radically complex holes and then [[tool making]] creating conscious parts much faster the key thing is that the relationship between these two is is fundamentally unstable and self-terminates say more about that this is what explains the everything from the fall of rome in the mayan empire to the eminent fall of our current one if we don't actually come up with a new third process which we'll speak to in a moment [1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1978.48s)

wow okay so so let's do a little quick summary because i i'm feeling like if i'm losing the plot a little bit other people might as well so let's just briefly redefine one and two and space for three i think i'm clearer about two but evolution tool-making so so evolution is something that happens basically through through trial and error genetic mutation [1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=1996.88s)

like the survival of that would work so what darwin wanted to do yep tool-making is more of a cognitive process which as far as we know is singular to human beings and what you're saying is that those two tend to to to go on a collision course with each other no i'm saying that so evolution has this kind of selection of what actually survives makes it through the tools give us increased ability to survive they give us as the species who can make the tool increase ability to survive by debasing all the rest of the environment that we depend upon okay okay so when we talk about environmental [2034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2034.24s)

degradation and we talked about war our tools are become the implements of larger scale war than lions or gorillas could have and they become the basis for larger scale environmental destruction than lions or gorillas could have okay and so if we behave the way that a lion behaves but we get to extend that through [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2051.52s)

massive [[tool making]] it actually is problematic so we become like a line with machine guns yeah so if you think about like great whites didn't overfish the ocean yeah because they couldn't yes because they would only get faster slowly as tuna were also getting faster or able to get away because the slowest sharks that didn't catch fish died [2070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2070.56s)

and the slowest tuna they got caught died and so there's a way that their rivalry with each other actually made both of them evolve in advance and we our whole theory of markets is based on that hey competition is a good creative force it'll make us all strive to do better the best products and services of the [2087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2087.599s)

best value will be the ones that the market selects for that'll be good for everybody but we're not acknowledging that the way that tools extend the power capacity and break the symmetry right there's a cemetery of speed between the tuna and the shark where the tuna gets away a lot of times and the [2104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2104.4s)

sharks die right sharks catch the tuna sometimes same as the lion in the gazelle or the fox and the rabbit right there's a cemetery of power where if the predator could become a hundred times faster in a hurry they would do better for one generation and then they would extinct themselves because they would eat all of [2121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2121.68s)

that extent themselves and the prey well they would extinct the prey which would then extinct themselves so it's only because there is a symmetry of their power with each other that they don't extinct themselves our ability to make tools allowed us to become 100 times better predators and with exponential tools a billion times better predators and to where that same evolutionary kind of competitive imperative doesn't end up creating sustainable holes it ends up creating a being that is debasing the substrate that it depends upon there you go yeah so let's let's zoom in a little bit before we get into back into this question of you know how [2156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2156.96s)

can i how can an individual best position themselves dedicated to the future generations let's just zoom in a little bit on on defining tools because tools obviously you know the example we've given so far is sharpening a stone to make an axe but today i mean software is a tool yeah right an understanding in a book i suppose could be a tool the results of abstraction right applied abstraction that's also a tool then right all tools are applied abstractions right right right so again how we said earlier that it was always an a new understanding about the nature of reality that gave us a new capacity [2192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2192.96s)

that is what shifted right a new understanding of the nature of what sharpness is that allowed us to make sharper things humans with spears were so different than humans without spears humans without spears lions just take out groups of humans with spears can kill every animal on the planet [2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2210.96s)

so automatically we become this [[apex predator]] because our claws aren't that big but we can make really big claws exactly right so our capacity to understand something allowed us to then apply that understanding in technology right in tool-making so spears of technology and so software yeah and but now we're still acting on the same kind of rivalrous evolutionary basis of like we're trying to get ahead at the expense of something else that the lion would be but there is now rather than the slow humans don't make it through or we come up to steady state with our local population and find steady state [2248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2248.16s)

here we could kill everything and then migrate and then go kill some everything somewhere else we could make tools like clothes where we could go to the arctic and the savannah and the islands no other animal could do that so we could go everywhere become the [[apex predator]] everywhere debase the environment everywhere build new tools to succeed at that when other humans are competing with us too much build the tools to kill the other humans let me ask you a question because we're sitting here in your very nice spacious dining room uh reflecting upon this so we're not having a conversation together about how can we build even more powerful tools to get more for you and me we're having a conversation about the potentially perilous impact of our tool building abilities which edges adds another layer to the whole dynamic so now so what what maybe that i don't know if we're heading the direction number three [2304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2304.56s)

but what impact does this insight have on our tool building ability for us to make it through a particular so the crises that we've had historically were induced by our own behavior some people had to be using abstraction to reflect on that to either an outside group that was seeing how to prey on that weakness and [2328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2328.48s)

be able to win in a war or the inside group saying how do we solve this so that's what our obstruction can do right so this does bring us to the number three if roughly we say evolution is kind of this unconscious evolution of holes though because again parts don't make it through long term [2345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2345.839s)

only short term and then [[tool making]] gives us conscious creation of parts the third thing that we have to get is the conscious creation of holes there you go yeah the conscious creation of whole self-stabilizing ecology so this is the thing is that individual species don't make it through in evolution very long [2366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2366.48s)

if they ruin the environment that they depend upon so the only species that make it through are the species that are part of a self-stabilizing ecology when we think about social darwinism like applying darwinian theory to the theory of markets the idea of a market is an evolutionary idea right we use competition and the best survival the fit is the best things make it through but we're not understanding that our way that we think of social darwinism is wrong in two really critical ways short term a highly successful animal will make it through or a highly successful species but long term if it is so successful that it damages the environment that it depends [2402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2402.56s)

upon it won't make it too so the only thing that makes it through long term is whole self-stabilizing ecologies we're not paying attention to that in the way we create markets and the way we try and make a business get ahead or a country get ahead we can do it at the expense of the world that we depend upon okay so [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2419.119s)

that's that is slowly suiciding ourselves as you mentioned that's the cigarette rather than the gun but it's still if i debase that which i depend upon i'm i am self-terminated the second thing we didn't get is that in in getting social darwinism wrong is that the animals can't [2437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2437.44s)

increase their capacity to do their competitive thing quickly and we can and as a result there's a certain kind of stability in evolution where the rivalry of the lion and the gazelle leads to both of them getting faster but very slowly very slowly the best gazelles that made it through the best lines made through but if one of them got a hundred times [2458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2458.96s)

faster quickly right if gazelles got 100 times faster all the lines would starve to death in a generation and then the gazelles would eat themselves to extinction if the land got 100 times faster we'd eat all the gazelles and then it would die so our ability to have tools extend our [2473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2473.28s)

predatory capacity but we're still acting like predators is suiciding and so we need not just okay how do we maximally get ahead our company our country our own personal balance sheet but when we can affect the whole as profoundly as we can we can extinct species we can create new species we can ruin [2494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2494.56s)

ecosystems we can create new ecosystems that's not the power of a predator that's the power of nature itself right the power there's nothing in nature that has the power that we have other than all of nature so we can't think like an [[apex predator]] because again think about a great white and then think about an ocean trawler and you're like what the [2511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2511.76s)

think about a lion as the [[apex predator]] and then think about a nuclear bomb so when we have that much power to affect the entire systems we have to actually become stewards of the entire systems now we're starting to talk about conscious evolution by design not design which is just making parts consciously and not evolution which is creation of self-stabilizing holes unconsciously but the creation of self-stabilizing holes consciously and this is what you were saying how do we become the agents for evolution yes it's actually the idea of being an agent for evolution is not evolution it's not the mathematics of it it is a new third thing [2549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2549.68s)

yes exactly and it's an ecology that has to be the base ecology but also our technological built world ecology how do we make a technological built world in harmony with a natural world that is self-stabilizing that in nature there is no such thing as trash and there is no such thing as unrenewable resource all the new stuff comes from old stuff [2565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2565.44s)

all the social recycled how do we make a built world that is actually stable that is metastable and self-evolving that that's the thing that actually i would say nobody ever figured out the earlier species that didn't i mean the earlier versions of humans that didn't have as big a tools as we had now seem more [2584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2584.56s)

sustainable just because they couldn't destroy stuff as quickly but that's the core thing that we actually need to figure out now yeah music as you're listening to this conversation with arjuna aarda and his radically brilliant guest you might feel inspired to go deeper into your own expression of radical [2613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2613.28s)

brilliance come join us for a one week radical brilliance laboratory held in a beautiful rural location in the sierra nevada mountains of california during the laboratory you'll have an opportunity to dive deeply into all four quadrants of the brilliant cycle this means you'll be able to explore experiences of consciousness without boundaries and you'll be able to start accessing original impulses of creativity from within yourself that can become your unique contribution to the world music you can get in touch with your own [2668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2668.96s)

learning and integrate mistakes that will allow you to mature and grow music you'll have the chance to deeply mine your own resources as well as connect with other brilliant people in a small intimate context for a week you can check out the radical brilliance laboratories at radicalbrilliance.com [2692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2692.96s)

under the events tab well let's do it before we i want to ask you one more question before we get into the kind of the really micro level of this is is let's let's just reflect a little bit how we're doing because there is a whole new uh kind of industry evolving which people call [2717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2717.52s)

social entrepreneurship or you know or eco uh eco businesses you know which are which where at least the visionary statement is to create technologies that have either minimum ecological impact or even an ecological restorative impact um and if there's always the danger if we come back to the way that we solve the problem with the horseshit in london [2741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2741.04s)

was something that was actually more harmful so how can we evaluate today the well-intentioned new industries that are evolving to try and be eco-friendly how much do they contain within themselves unprecedented consequence yeah okay lots of people won't like what i have to [2764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2764.64s)

say about this okay so they can listen to other things um when einstein was developing relativity he did not intend of all yes he didn't intend the first ever tool that could extinct everything but it was directly the result of the work he did if we look at that phenomenon we didn't [2787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2787.28s)

we didn't intend [[climate change]] and destabilization of the whole world politically and war from cars yes but that happened yeah um and when the wright brothers were making the first planes they weren't necessarily focused on the military industrial complex having plain technologies to be able to kill people [2811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2811.04s)

at a scale never previously dreamed of that only could happen with those planes so there's this topic of weaponization and i don't just mean a military weapon i mean a tool that gets used for some rivalrous purpose once it's been developed and so when we when i talk about weaponization i mean the ability to win a finite win lose game [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2834.4s)

that can be a kinetic warfare where we're actually physically killing each other it can also be an economic warfare where we're trying to compete for market share it can be an info warfare where we're trying to keep the actual info about reality to ourselves maybe even disinform the other guy right we're a [[narrative warfare]] we have the best narrative and it's our religion it's the best religion or our political party or our nation or our race or religion right those are all basically ways that an in-group tries to maintain and advance its competitive advantage related to an out group where they believe that they're in a zero-sum relationship with each other [2869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2869.68s)

so somebody tells me hey some academics work on ai called me recently who identify as progressive and said we figured out some great new ai capacity for being able to take the progressive doctrine and spread through the world we can we can basically customize people's news feeds the way that is the right is currently doing but better whatever and i said let's not even discuss whether that progressive doctrine is the right one or the true one but let's just take the for granted that you assume you're right and that you should use all the tools possible to win at the game that you're sure you're right on which is what all wars have [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2907.92s)

always been on all sides yes do you think that once you deploy the technology if it is found to be effective that it won't be reverse engineered and used by all sides for all purposes because of course it will be so all you do the moment you deploy a technology and it's advantageous everyone reverse engineers it makes [2929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2929.92s)

mutations on it uses it and then seeks to advance insights in a rivalry setting so you might get some near-term advantage but really you just up the ante of the scale of warfare for everybody this is the thing we actually have to solve as a species writ large right now if i develop a fundamentally [2947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2947.76s)

new capacity i'm developing ai for medical research and it's going to do big it's going to use visual recognition on patient data records that are being scanned in to then have big data and deep learning to do early predictive disease stuff awesome that seems like we're going to save a lot of [2966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2966.16s)

lives can that same ai technology be used for weaponized purposes yes where there is major advantage to do so in financial and et cetera yes and where no group will avoid doing it really because they assume that the other groups are doing it anyways and so then they lose if they don't so [2984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=2984.88s)

this is this this idea of a [[race to the bottom]] right nobody wants to give up their nukes first because everybody everybody knows like we're not sucker we we're the first ones to give up our nukes we get taken over it's happened and you can't force anyone who has nukes to give up their nukes everybody else [3001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3001.92s)

wants more nukes but now we're in the same place within ai weapons like nobody wants to live in a world with ai weapons everyone knows that's just a comprehensively worse world for everyone but everybody's working on making them because we assume that if we don't the other guy is and then we just lose by default so to not lose by default if anyone does we [3019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3019.68s)

have to and we have to race towards the worst world possible this is called a [[multipolar trap]] and as long as we have separable interests one nation that can advance itself at the expense of another one company that can or even one balance sheet that can we won't be able to get out of multiple [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3039.599s)

traps where even if i'm developing new capacity for a positive purpose it will get weaponized so um and if i'm that's one issue the other one is if i'm seeking to advance some metric that's important might i be damaging other metrics in the process like let's do geoengineering to bring temperature down but in the process we might drive [3060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3060.64s)

acid rain and pollution whole environments and whatever the way we think about how to solve problems is not adequate to the complexity of our problems we can't try and isolate out some metrics as if the world isn't interconnected try to advantage those and we can't pretend that our capacity won't be [3077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3077.599s)

utilized for all purposes that there's incentive to utilize them for now when i say conscious creation of new holes that's what i mean it's not just we're going to create some solution for this thing which is a part which is what most social entrepreneurship is doing yeah but can we think about how do all these problems relate what what are the underlying drivers that have every all humans working towards things that nobody actually wants nobody actually wants war but a for-profit military-industrial complex and these multipolar kind of dynamics make it hard for anyone to avoid doing it how do we solve those [3112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3112.48s)

yes yeah yeah right so i think this is a good point because it's it's actually in my at least in my view right now it's my mind just crumples the thought of doing that collectively right now but when we think about how can an individual shift their values their belief systems [3132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3132.72s)

their way of life their daily practices to come more into that view it seems very attainable on a micro level so i mean i think you and i probably you know given given choice we would probably look to whole system solutions more than individual solutions a good parent will put often put the needs of their children [3155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3155.839s)

before their own needs you know and we can extrapolate that but you know there are there are there have been and i hope hopefully today there are examples of leaders who will put the the good of the whole uh beyond the good of the even the [[nation state]] or certainly beyond their beyond the need of their own party right [3174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3174.24s)

so we have seen examples of that so i'd like to zero in to make this really um to see if we can turn this into some kind of action steps for people what can we do if we if we want to really fully align ourselves with the best possible future what are some ways that we can change the way we think and behave [3193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3193.04s)

individually so that you know healthy trees become a healthy forest so i mean press before you answer the question that's asking do you think that's a do you think that's a is do you think that's a helpful question sometimes we end up asking the wrong question there's a deeper analysis we haven't done yet [3215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3215.839s)

i'll just allude to it okay which is that the processes that have been most successful so far for how we solve problems our problem solving toolkit itself i propose are inadequate to solve the types of problems we have now right so democracy is an example capitalism is an example and science is an example these are like our favorite best things yet right as meta processes for how we do stuff music their base so democracy we can see that in the u.s the left right polarization is untenable that really good clear understanding of the world and what comprehensively good strategies are [3272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3272.24s)

would be don't exist anywhere in any political party we can see that not just in the us but kind of everywhere but but then as we just kind of look at the math of it if we look at the just fundamental structure we say okay democracy is a way that when there's too many people for everyone to be part of one [3289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3289.04s)

conversation rather than just have a few people rule everything right some kind of dictatorship a meritocracy how do we at least make sure that since everybody can't agree can we at least get that most people agree that's kind of the idea yeah i'll just i just have to quickly slip in there dictatorship is not always a meritocracy [3305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3305.28s)

structurally meritocracy dictatorship and consensus this is a way we would structuralize it right consensus is everybody agrees yeah democracy is at least most people agree on something meritocracy is for some reason some people make most of the decisions and it's based on some idea of who should make the decisions and maybe the merit is [3328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3328.96s)

i just won the power game the game of thrones or i'm just a bigger than everybody that's the game of thrones right i won the power game yeah sometimes it was just i was born into that royal family lineage sometimes i was elected whatever right i think it would be worth looping back to that later because there [3344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3344.16s)

might be a genuine meritocracy we could propose which is actually not so much based upon uh those kind of accidental factors but but a genuine ability to to to be able to to um embrace the good of the whole but let's put that aside that actually comes very much back to what you were saying is can [3365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3365.839s)

people increase their capacity and then put the whole first and then can those people maybe work together in some meaningful way great yeah but so just when we look at democracy we say okay well when there's when there's the i if everybody can't agree at least more people liking something than not seems fairer than [3382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3382.48s)

more people not liking it okay but if everyone can't be part of one conversation who even makes the propositions so somebody some small some process makes propositions that usually is focused on benefiting something that is cared about by that group special interest group or whatever it is [3400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3400.559s)

but that proposition to benefit that thing they care about is connected to other stuff that they might not be aware of at all or might not care about exactly so every proposition pretty much benefits something and harm something else because the way it was formed didn't have everyone [[sensemaking]] actually informing what a good [3421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3421.52s)

proposition would even be and so that's why you never have a time where everybody votes yes or everybody votes no on a proposition because if if i really care about the thing that's being benefited i like the proposition but if i really care about the thing that's being harmed i don't like it now if you really care about the thing [3438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3438.96s)

that's being benefited and you're voting yes for it would make your children's lives better because it's going to help jobs or whatever and you guys can't get jobs but i say it's going to hurt the environment and so i'm saying no because i care about the environment i don't need the job as much then you see that i am actively lobbying [3453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3453.92s)

to make your child's life worse now that creates so much enmity and polarization right that then now we start spending most of our time not coordinating with each other but fighting each other so now this is a massive [[coordination failure]] and the truth is something that was good for the environment and good for jobs [3470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3470.96s)

would be preferred by everyone but we don't have a process of [[collective intelligence]] to come up with what would a good way forward for everyone even look like so the process of voting yes no on any proposition is inherently polarizing so any system that just even uses voting it's not a good enough system of [[collective intelligence]] to have a population actually be able to do collective [[sensemaking]] of what's needed and collective choice making so that's an example of like well it was a good tool it got us pretty far but that tool itself is not a [[collective intelligence]] tool that will solve these problems i'll make a suggestion what do you think [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3507.52s)

if we because i can see we could have an equally in-depth conversation about democracy capitalism and science great how about we put that into a another time a second conversation and let's see if we can loop back to a few takeaways for uh so the proposition you're right the proposition i was going to say is that our processes themselves for how we [3527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3527.52s)

solve things are themselves actually the cause of the major problems we're dealing with now we can see that capitalism and market-driven solutions and most of the problems in the world are financially incented right we and we can see that science makes all the tech that is causing the problems but science is not commensurate [3544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3544.88s)

with an ethical system for how do we actually you know science says what is but not what ought and so it makes all the applied tech power without having any guidance on it so then again capitalism and power games end up being what implies it so then we say okay if i try and just make a new business [3561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3561.28s)

within capitalism or a new tech within science or a new proposition or a new representative within democracy those are not deep enough solutions for the nature of the issues we have and that's us thinking within a certain axiomatic framework of what has got us here but what has got us here has got us the successes but also all of the [3582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3582.64s)

systemic failures so what i'm saying is that we actually need a new problem-solving toolkit that is deeper than capitalism the philosophy of science and democracy and that so if i default to an action bias what can i do and i'm assuming that i do it within those frameworks that we've done stuff before [3601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3601.44s)

i would propose we don't actually solve the problems we need to solve at best we will solve one problem making another problem worse great so i'm actually hearing kind of an answer to both these questions because because i'm thinking about how can an individual best position themselves to make the greatest contribution yes and [3618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3618.079s)

you're you're saying to make any kind of contribution within the existing system is going to be you know at worst disastrous and and at best irrelevant so what what i'm hearing in this is that what individuals actually need to cultivate more than anything is what are sometimes called [3638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3638.24s)

like disruptive thinking right which is this this central mantra who says who says it has to be this way one of my other guests i don't know if you've met them yet but there's a there are twins uh mickey and radha agarwal do you know that oh well that's a treat coming your way [3656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3656.0s)

soon most incredible uh mickey is married to andrew horn who's sam horn's son they just have this innate ability to question status quo not in an aggressive way but but in like wait a minute who said it has to be like that how about we do like this instead [3673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3673.92s)

but at a very fundamental level right simple example is um uh radha she she loves she loves dance she loves party right so when we think of you know if i tell you i'll just give you a quick example it's about disruptive thinking because it's because i i'm thinking it's a great way [3691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3691.04s)

for us to explore so if you think about you know she loves to be with a large group of people you know with loud music and and everybody's dancing and sweaty you know and and if i ask you about if i was to ask you you know your assumptions if a bunch of people get together you know what time of day is it usually middle of the night right and then what [3712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3712.319s)

are they consuming it's probably alcohol cocaine you know we could keep going so she was disruptive she thought well there are things i really like about this but there are things that are regrettable because it bounces and everything so what does she do she created this thing called daybreaker which is basically raves at six o'clock in the morning right [3728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3728.799s)

so everybody gets up gets up after a good night's sleep goes up to some factory somewhere you know some abandoned factory has a rave where there's going to be good quality coffee green smoothies you know instead of bouncers there are huggers you know so this is disruptive you know it's disrupting what we think is necessary for something to happen [3745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3745.599s)

what i'm hearing you say is that for an individual rather than rather than learning to compete really effectively within the existing system is to really think disruptively about the systems themselves uh yes thinking outside of the frameworks of what has already been accepted we could call disruption in as deeper way as possible it's what [3768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3768.319s)

i'm hearing in as deep away as possible and but obviously i can disrupt stuff in lots of ways that don't forward yes and so just just forgive me disruption is one of those terms that it's kind of like when you when there's a pop song you really like but then it's played so many times that you kind of stop liking it [3790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3790.0s)

disruption is one of those terms that has been made so sadly weak because silicon valley caught on to it and then basically any company that is going to be able to get a lot of market share is disruptive even if it's the same fundamental the same fundamental concept of how to win at a win-lose game and even if it's a kind of narcissistic [3808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3808.96s)

disruption just destruction for disruption's sake yeah or it's disrupting how an industry does things but for the meta purpose of why industries exist at all which is for somebody to get ahead in a win-lose fashion yes so and i'm thinking about applying disruption to the very fundamentals of decision-making process of economics [3827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3827.839s)

and of the way that we gather information yes so now let's think about that and say we said we can't just depend on evolution because it is too slow in its changes and that we're affecting things at too big a scale through now technology creation that technology creation and evolution [3850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3850.079s)

together give us kind of this rivalrous basis from evolution but multiplied by radical power asymmetry if we don't start thinking about the conscious creation of what our actual sustainable holes and take responsibility for the whole not parts within it and then then we fit um if all of my organs separate [3870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3870.0s)

like all the parts that seem well designed are not interesting it is actually only the way that it all comes together and if i think about all the ways to arrange the molecules in a cell there's trillions of ways arranging those molecules that all fail there are very few that actually make a cell that respirates even though none of [3888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3888.0s)

the molecules respirate and so it's how all the parts come together into a hole that is the synergy that is more than some of its parts that's the whole thing it's a brilliant analogy actually because i mean you couldn't imagine if the stomach and the liver competed greedily for blood [3904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3904.799s)

we would yeah right and so when you think about well in the body how does it work it's not we divvy up the resources equally between all cells or all organs it's also not that they compete with each other and horde it's a much more complex process of what what is most needed right now factoring everything and a distribution [3926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3926.16s)

of the resources to everything factoring the whole it's a different process right and the so there is a difference between the lungs and the heart but they are inseparable so you can't factor their difference in a separable way so what i want to see people so you ask what is a way that people can start right now [3948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3948.4s)

thinking about this yeah if people started to say well what if i was responsible like if i what if i was responsible for the whole for all of it yeah how would i even start to think about how to approach that how would i start to design that because there's a way where i can think about my people [3967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3967.599s)

and how to defend my people that just leads me to continuing warfare knowing that the other side will then also continue warfare and we get big enough warfare that kills everyone i can think about how to solve temperature because i don't want the ice caps to melt by reflecting 20 of the sunlight that then has okay well [3985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=3985.44s)

what happens all that stuff i put in the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight when it comes down into the water and when it you know we i can think about partial problems not in relationship to the whole where all i do is actually move the problem somewhere else and oftentimes make it worse yes that doesn't work anymore so what [4002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4002.72s)

i'm saying is partial problems are not solvable anymore the whole is too complexly interconnected the whole has always been interconnected but our level of globalized technology and the total impact of technology makes the eminence of the interconnection sets that we have to this is the core thing we are too [4019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4019.76s)

powerful in our effect on the whole to not be taking active responsibility for how that power affects the whole so if i'm going to be making a choice that affects stuff i need to be contemplating everything that's affected and internalizing all of those effects to the design yeah i call that omni consideration how do i [4039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4039.2s)

consider how do i both care about and think about the cause and effect of everything affected i love how you that distinction between care about and think about because it has to be both those are actually two different things right because they're thinking about is where we can where it's necessary to be able to think [4055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4055.599s)

but it's intrinsically limited by what we by knowledge and by um by the restraints of of of logic but then care about actually has a more of a has more of a you know i guess we'd use a cliche word like my heart you know but but more more compassion more more of a an intelligence that's not not that's [4079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4079.119s)

not it's not limited by rationality if you're enjoying this podcast you might enjoy dropping by radicalbrilliance.com we've got an ebook for you which explains the radical brilliance cycle the way the cycle gets blocked and the practices that best open up the cycle again [4111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4111.279s)

gardner talked about eight types of intelligence that are all different and the chakra system of indian thinking or chinese or egyptian thinking were like different kinds of intelligences and they said they actually all need to be lit up right and aligned with each other let's just do a super simplified version for a moment where we talk about kind of [4209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4209.76s)

will heart and mind okay and again recognizing we're simplifying and making a model which is always kind of wrong but useful so for some of this stuff a lot of people are going to be hearing this so let's just i'm just going to say where you were pointing to will you're pointing like to your solar plexus i mean if your [4227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4227.679s)

heart you obviously brought into your heart and mind your point into a place just between your eyebrows yeah head roughly yeah so if we if we take will as the um the actual force to make choices right the actual uh impulse and capacity to make choices at all okay if we take heart as what is it that i actually care about and what is it that i actually value that i want my choice to be in service to and then i take mind as how do i understand what an effective choice would be how do i understand cause and effect to be able to do design or strategy or [4270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4270.32s)

tactics right we see that they all play in together so we can talk about choice making resulting from the way we do [[sensemaking]] what's actually happening and what would happen if i did x and values generation what do we care about what are we trying to affect so again as we saw in that example [4289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4289.44s)

earlier with democracy if what i care about is the economy and people being able to get jobs and i say that's all i care about i'll ruin the environment if all i care about is the environment i'll create poverty no i actually care about both now they're both design constraints to be able to come up with a better proposal [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4306.719s)

that doesn't pit them against each other yeah and so that's a fundamental change in a human being it is a fundamental change that we stop thinking in terms of theory of trade-offs of things that are actually synergistic and symbiotic with each other and say if i take both of them as design constraints what is a better design that actually serves the relationship between them yeah you know the the the most kind of the analogy that comes that's most visceral and i can imagine would be a parent who going to their kids football game who's actually wants the other team to win as much as [4344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4344.48s)

she wants her son's team to win because they're all kids one day they're all kids who you know have the same right to a good time to into a feeling of heroism feeling of triumphing in if i take that example i say within one game the game is by definition zero sum there is only one win that can happen and if [4365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4365.28s)

one side gets it the other side does not get it but exercise isn't the you know exercise isn't but even if i take the iteration of the game and i say hey this if if the mom only supports this one side and the other side is not well supported they come from low income and their parents aren't there or whatever it is then [4383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4383.76s)

one i'm not caring about the whole but it doesn't even create a good sports game from my side because they stopped having a good team to play against so if i care about the quality of play more than a particular win then of course i want to support everyone to keep increasing the quality of play um but unlike a football game most things actually aren't zero-sum we artificially assume that they are and make them that way yes exactly most of the time if i say okay well i want to protect the environment and i want to make the economy better if i don't if if basically if i don't consciously think about that i can just cut down the trees [4421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4421.199s)

helmets two by fours dead trees are worth more than living trees living trees aren't worth anything on my economic balance sheet we'll cut all the trees down which we've done but if i say is there a way i could make a forest worth more alive than dead and i took that as a design challenge and i started to think about ecotourism in the area or whatever it [4436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4436.8s)

would be as soon as the forest is worth more alive than dead protecting the forest and advancing the economy aren't in a theory of trade-offs anymore they're synergistic well you're using the word worth yeah in its commonly used meaning tied to money yeah but if we thought about worth in terms of [4455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4455.679s)

the quality of life of our grandchildren then definitely a living forest is worth more than a dead forest to our grandchildren having a good life now this comes down to why i said capitalism is an inadequate framework exactly because if those two worths are decoupled the people who focus on the money get [4473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4473.44s)

the near term advantage because now they're getting they're concentrating choice making more money means i can put more people in my employment and more technology in my employment which means i have more choice making and then they'll end up winning at how they affect the world because they're increasing their capacity to affect the [4490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4490.64s)

world and those who are trying to conserve for future generations aren't increasing their choice making capacity and they lose so tibet loses to china greece loses to rome the matriarchal nice tribes lose to the warring tribes we can't keep doing that thing right and so if i could have a place [4505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4505.04s)

where the near-term advantage and the long-term well-being are decoupled then we're just screwed and capitalism happens to decouple what provides the most near-term advantage to me and what provides the best long-term well-being for the whole are not the same i think we need to have a whole another conversation about what coupling what would be required for coupling those great yeah but let's come back to the three things real quick because we didn't close that and that's actually the thing i wanted to close with is that all right yeah sure sure well let's let's let's close that and then let's finish with a takeaway [4536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4536.64s)

particularly i'd like to think of a takeaway for a younger person yeah for like you know what's actually just like a daily practice for your doctor or some commitment you could make to to inject whole [[systems thinking]] into your into your day this will relate okay great so let's go ahead and just take this simplified model of [4558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4558.719s)

my capacity to make choices will my and to this is this is non-trivial right because a lot of people feel like oh i want to make a certain kind of choice like to exercise or meditate or eat a certain way but my habits overwhelm me so i don't feel like my will is strong enough to actually make the choices aligned with what i value and what i [4579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4579.199s)

know and so the development of will is the ability to have your own choice be a deeper influence in your life than the choice of everybody else or habits or past conditioning so that's the development of will right that i my choice is actually more coupled internally [4596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4596.239s)

to what i care about and what i understand rather than to a bunch of other stuff habits and defaults so the development of will one thing right the development of what do i care about i can care about my people and as a result support a war not realizing that the other people who [4615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4615.76s)

care about their people will keep also trying to win at the war we just keep escalating more for everybody right i can care about my family getting ahead not realizing that everyone caring about their family getting ahead within the current construct actually ruins the environment in a way that no families will get ahead so how do i expand the scope of what i [4633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4633.04s)

care about to include more because it is all connected and then [[sensemaking]] how do i actually understand the way that it's like okay well if i want to try and solve these problems what causes the problems why there's 70 trillion dollars that trades hands every day that all represents human motive [4649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4649.84s)

but most of it is actually externalizing harm somewhere how do we create a better system that doesn't incentivize the wrong things how do i advance my understanding how to advance my understanding of how is [[climate change]] and war and expression of the same thing when lose kinds of structures or how does this metric and this metric [4668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4668.8s)

relate so now let's look at just any of those in isolation if or even couplings of them if i take really effective mind the capacity to do strategy well and really effective will together without widely inclusive values i get effective sociopaths yes i get the military industrial [4693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4693.52s)

complex uh and i get the coupling of will and intellect correct but without compassion or caring or heart roughly right at least and of course this is a generalization because everybody has heart towards something but it might be quite narrow right so we're going to get [4709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4709.28s)

our narrow agenda ahead but with a tremendous amount of action and a tremendous amount of strategy so that coupling is kind of actively ruining the world if i take mind and heart together i get like a smart caring academic but who can't actually do stuff because they don't have effective will and they're just kind of [4730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4730.239s)

crippled by the scope of the problems if i take will and heart together without mind i get activists who are working their ass off well towards the goal of the whole but without good strategies and as a result the military-industrial complex and multinationals who have better strategies will just win every time so we can see that like ineffective activists or um overwhelmed unpowerful caring academics or kind of sociopathic effective like none of those couplings are okay it takes all of them yeah if you take away any of those three legs of the stool the stool is going to fall or fall over right [4771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4771.44s)

yeah and what ends up happening is the effect of sociopathy wins in the short term and kills everything in the long term right right and we rationalize the sociopathy hey if i don't do this somebody will i'm i'm trying to do at least the one part i can do i have to break some eggs to make the omelet we because it's the only thing we [4789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4789.04s)

can think to do but when you look at like okay so gandhi was a person who ended up defeating the world ruling empire and freeing 400 million slaves not to say he didn't have some failings but you look at the will and the heart and the the strategy together they were all deeply invested in [4807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4807.76s)

yeah and everyone who made the most meaningful changes there's a there's a way that those are coupled together so if you think about in your own life what are what are you developing if every day or every month or week or whatever you are in some ways developing your will so that the choices you make are more [4828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4828.159s)

aligned with what you understand and what you care about and there are ways of doing this there's ways of like okay i before i turn my phone on i meditate meditation itself even if it's just short is how do i actually bring my thoughts and and body under will more i when i consciously breathe [4847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4847.92s)

i'm bringing something that's normally unconscious in the consciousness and having choice influence it more right choice influence my thought so how do i keep advancing my will and we could have a whole talk on that how do i keep expanding deepening what i care about and expanding it so i go to a [[factory farm]] and i see the condition that the animals are in and i'm like is there a model of my life that feels like a success to me as long as these animals are in this condition they can't get themselves out and it's not their fault they're here but i could do something to get them out on the outside what what do i need to do about this and i go [4886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4886.4s)

look at the trash in the ocean i go look at so how do i extend my scope of care and deepen it so it is more in the forefront of my experience and then mind is am i seeking to understand what's actually going on in the world better and what could be effective am i seeking to think more deeply about how could we [4904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4904.96s)

solve these problems what would a world that worked for everyone even look like have i thought through this that well how one of my like favorite practices my whole life was imagining what would life on an enlightened planet be like totally yeah and it's not obvious because you start to run and you say well they would vote would they vote how would that not [4926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4926.719s)

create polarization between them would they even do that how would they craft a proposal in the first place how would they how would they listen to each other how would they actually deal with emotions and sexuality and with conflict and i've got an idea yeah let's do a whole conversation just about that just just fantasizing what would life be like on a planet where they didn't make any mistakes i wouldn't even say didn't make any mistakes i would say where people's will was developed and their heart and their mind were all developed right we take that as kind of a definition of enlightenment that they [4960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4960.0s)

are all caring about the whole they're thinking about the whole effectively and they're acting aligned with their thinking and caring yeah how would they do stuff and if you really like we could do a whole podcast on that but i guess the thing i'm encouraging is that everyone actually has that be central to their life yes and that they're really thinking [4977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4977.12s)

about that yeah because they're like well am i even working to bring about a world that makes any sense what would a world to make any sense even mean i haven't even thought about what a world that would make any sense would look like well enough to have a sense that that's actually the right thing yeah one of one of the [4989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=4989.679s)

other uh guests i have on this series is martin roo who actually developed this thing called the heaven on earth project and he that's all he does he just gets people to imagine what is your idea of heaven on earth but of course just imagining it warms the whole thing up and so then we [5006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5006.4s)

start to compare our actions today with what we imagine so i think that's a beautiful um practice and if people are if you were just asking we're talking about very like collective structural issues like that tool design and evolution together create instability and we need to create this new third [5026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5026.8s)

process for how humans consciously take responsibility for the power that we have and create creating holes and you're like well what do individuals do if every period of time day week whatever you want to consider your will is advancing you're actually getting better at choosing a way that's aligned with what you care about and [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5045.679s)

what you understand what you care about is advancing you're deepening your consideration of what do i care about and feeling it right so you watch the documentaries and you let them hurt but then you say they only hurt because i care if i didn't care about the animals or the oceans this wouldn't hurt at all and then you take the hurt back to the care and be like wow i actually really  love the ecosystem i really love people i love those people who have never met in poverty where that's why when i see them hurting there it hurts me right actually just love the essence of humanity let yourself deep in that [5074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5074.32s)

and be coupled to it where all the choices of your life have to be expressions of it and let yourself keep deepening on the every day week etc basis how we understand the world what do i under and like we said it was newton deepening the way of understanding the world that led to the whole world shifting [5093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5093.84s)

or einstein or von neumann or the greeks or whatever how do i deepen so how do i deepen what i care about how do i deepen my understanding of the world and how do i make deepen the congruency of my actions being aligned with those i would say that's just a very simplified framework for am i developing [5109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5109.36s)

myself as the type of person that can be an agent for the whole brilliant brilliant you know we could add one little piece to that which i think is so important is developing friendships and relationships which directly cultivate those three qualities because that's you know we are so much more effective at [5124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5124.56s)

bringing about changes in the way we operate when we do it together thanks a lot for spending two things on the friendship just briefly okay yeah one is the individuals can't change these things it has to be groups yeah so you when you were asking about individuals like yes but then of course even to the degree i'm succeeding how do [5141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5141.52s)

i come together with other people to do this but then it's also even recursive who i'm hanging out around is going to influence how i'm developing as a person yeah more than pretty much anything else yeah so consciously paying attention to am i interacting with people in ways that are supporting [5158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5158.48s)

the evolution of who i'm wanting to be you know it's funny i because i'm doing a you know i'm sitting in your house i did a coaching session with a client this morning and he said oh where are you because this is four posts to bed and i said i said oh i'm at daniel schwarzenberger's house he said oh my god he said [5174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5174.32s)

because the last week that i talked to him i was coaching him sitting in the car outside lyndon twist house whereas every time i talk to him i'm about to meet somebody that he really admires he said oh my god you're constantly surrounded by all these amazing people and i thought yeah why why would you choose anything [5189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5189.199s)

else you know i mean just in the same way if you go to i shop at our local co-op you know and i buy the best ingredients why would you choose to put anything else in your body except what's going to help to operate in the best way so friendships can be like that it's like it's like eating organic food you surround yourself with people who [5208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5208.639s)

share your intention to make the best possible difference and it has an exponential effect we kind of we support each other in upward direction and thank you for doing that with me for the last like so the last period of time here thank you i look forward [5224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5224.239s)

music hey well that was daniel schmacktenberger always amazing gets you thinking in a deep way you know in nevada city where i live on friday nights i go to an event called fusion dance it's a great it's a greater form of dance merged together from [5265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5265.12s)

different styles of dance from the streets rather than from the ballroom so when i go along there there's sometimes you know somewhere between 40 and 60 people and i used to have this unspoken code in my mind that you can only dance with the same person once in the evening so if you've danced with somebody you've got to go ask somebody else to dance but [5285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5285.92s)

after a long time of going to fusion dance on friday nights i ask myself the question who says who says you can only dance with the same partner once if you really enjoy dancing with somebody you could dance with them over and over again in the same same evening and i've taken the same approach to this podcast so you'll be hearing plenty more from daniel who says that i can only have him as a guest once so um he's one of my favorite people one of the most intelligent altruistic compassionate people i know using his powerful way of lateral thinking not for his own self-advancement [5328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5328.199s)

but for all of us it's uh it's really kind of bodhisattva thinking at its highest level so we'll be hearing plenty more from daniel in the weeks and months to come now in our podcast today as you heard i was kind of pressing daniel a little bit for uh for take away how can we how can we take this understanding of [5352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5352.719s)

what we need collectively to advance to evolve to to survive and apply it individually and he spoke about the cultivation of understanding mind of caring heart and of will of action and then he asked a question we we just brushed over it quite quickly but he asked this question what would a society [5379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5379.76s)

look like either a society we imagine from our own future or perhaps from a society on another planet in a science fiction scenario what would a society look like where people were living in highly advanced states of understanding caring and [5401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5401.84s)

the capacity to implement and create results daniel pointed out the disastrous results of mind and will without heart which is sociopathology of mind and heart without will which is the sort of disempowered caring academic and he also spoke about [5425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5425.28s)

implementing an heart without understanding which he called a kind of music activism which doesn't uh include the whole or which becomes fragmented from other other activism so what would a human being look like and what would society look like with [5447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5447.44s)

the full development and the full integration of those three of mind the capacity to understand things in a whole systems way of heart capacity to care deeply about things that don't only affect you personally and will the capacity to create results in a physical way [5470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5470.639s)

so i'm going to ask you to contemplate that as our takeaway from today you could do it maybe right now in your journal is uh imagine a society imagine a society in your own future or on another planet where people collectively have developed the capacity to have all three of these operating at a peak level together [5492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5492.96s)

you can share the fruits of your contemplation on radicalbrilliance.com go to the podcast tab you'll find this podcast there where you can comment or you could go to facebook.com forward slash radical brilliance scroll down you'll find this podcast you can comment there as well i'm always we are always very interested to hear what you have to say [5519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5519.52s)

till next time we've got a whole bunch of amazing guests lined up all of whom in their own way have dedicated their lives to a sense of contribution everybody i invite onto this podcast has found a way a kind of a modest unostentatious bodhisattva vow a way to make their lives a contribution to the sustained nobility [5546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rYFnDx6nQ&t=5546.8s)

and the quality of life of people not even yet born see you next time music you
