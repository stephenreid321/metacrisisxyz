music and welcome back to another segment of boldly mill i'm rachel morrison and i'm michael sean conaway and i have the great pleasure of bringing you a conversation with my good friend daniel martin berger he is a guy who spends a lot of time on global and global [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] something that will have you think for a while and i'm sure this conversation will give us a new [40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=40.53s)

perspective on the things that we're dealing with on a day to day basis and really as we look forward into the future what are the some of the things that are important for us to look towards daniel welcome really great to have you here today thanks for having me let's just start off with where you are you know for all of us the pandemic has caused some some [62](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=62.039s)

dramatic and large shifts in life but i find that that extra just that's different for everybody in their worlds how is your world been altered or changed are there things that have changed the levels of importance and urgency for you yeah what's what's going on over there for you it's interesting having been communicating with people about the risk of large-scale global [87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=87.75s)

catastrophes for a long time versus being in one that is happening in terms of people's general ability to feel the reality of it and at this point the actual risk from the virus itself is relatively small compared to the risk of our responses to the virus so when we're talking about things like shutting down travel which makes sense if there's a viral transmission thing but in ways [120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=120.36s)

that don't protect [[food supply]] issues and then damaging the pesticides getting to northern africa and parts the middle east so locusts take over the food and restaurants not being able to be the major importers of food and not having other [[supply chain]] possibilities and so you know damaging the [[food supply]] for two billion people is a bigger deal then the viruses itself in terms of actual [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=143.55s)

risk to life so is the in authoritarian ism of states breakdown of international alliances increase in state-based and corporate based surveillance capabilities escalation pathways towards violence so you know we're in a the situation was like co vid was just a big enough thing that it was able to set off a cascade of things that were all that would have been set off by [173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=173.22s)

something right because there was all these systemic fragilities and so now people's relationship to the topic of global [[catastrophic risk]] is different yeah and and you know how does that does that alter your work at all you've just been working on the things you've been working on is there any change of focus or change of urgency or anything for you right now yeah i mean there's there are [197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=197.519s)

a lot more people who are more ready to take the conversation seriously so there's a lot of things that have accelerated for us there's also a lot of things that have to happen on relatively quick timelines where they reach points of irreversibility so there's a lot in my focus and work that has happened because of that responding to kovat is intelligible [223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=223.88s)

right and i'm way more than responding to global ecological crisis or ai risk or anything else was its intelligible in a different way and eminence right and timely and having government funds allocated to it and all the new cycles and things like that and so insofar as responding to kove it also means responding to the second-order effects associated with co vid there are a lot [246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=246.359s)

more institutional conversations happening that are at least kind of thinking about some things a little bit better far from adequate so at the same time i would say that the general information ecology has gotten much much worse i mean it was already completely fragmented but and i would say one of the things it is most concerning to me and we're doing [280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=280.91s)

some work towards trying to help with this is the mismatch between the actual complexity of the problems facing the world and the complexity that most people can actually process on their own so most people want relatively simple narratives and so that you see this in bipartisan politics is that they want some kind of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are and they either [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=305.91s)

want that the general authorities are generally good and the virus is really serious and we should kind of listen to the authorities and stay home and or the general authorities are probably bad and this is a attempt to take all our civil liberties away and the virus is probably exaggerated and the nuance of like well the virus is serious and there are real serious responses that need to happen [331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=331.41s)

there's also a lot of predatory opportunism that various power actors have there's a distribution of the goodness and badness of authorities towards different goals the the actual reality of it is just much more nuanced and complex and not a simple narrative arc and then when it comes to the science of like so how what is the actual case fatality rate is this just a [358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=358.41s)

flu is it more serious than the flu the epidemiology is not totally trivial right to actually understand wait are we doing background tests on non symptomatic people and is an immunological assay of the right kind and does it what are the false positives and negatives and and then people will start talking about the association of 5-g or maybe it's not really a virus [378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=378.199s)

it's an exosome well most people don't have enough molecular biology to be able to answer that and so then whoever it is it starts trending on facebook because it hits some emotional tropes ends up being what gets shared and echo-chamber effective and it's emotional and it's consequential and people are actually spending more time trying to sense make while coming up with worse answers and [400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=400.979s)

then also wanting to act on ai wanting to take their guns and go out in front of the protest building or wanting to get facebook and google to shut down all news of those types of those people don't do that which are all basically escalations towards violence of different types all based on wrong information and theirs is their i mean this is the economy the [421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=421.05s)

information ecology so damaged that there's little or no hope of actually getting good information right now i think that what it takes to get actionable intelligence to get enough information that your action on it will actually be appropriate action is a higher level of capacity and discipline than most people have yeah and that's the tricky thing yeah and we have to [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=454.23s)

have trust somewhere then we're gonna have to trust we're gonna have to if we can't do it for ourselves and either we have go with an understanding that we're not going to ever have good [[sensemaking]] or we have to trust somebody's analysis we have to trust our own discernment capacity to know who we trust right like this is true in personal relationships if you trusted somebody and got hurt [478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=478.11s)

because they embezzled from you or cheated on you or whatever it is there's a deeper question around why did you trust them if they were not actually trustworthy which is trusting your own capacity for discernment and their it might be trustworthiness of intent but also trustworthiness of capacity and sense-making so to the degree that i want to [496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=496.29s)

cognitively offload some of the complexity to someone else i'm still ultimately responsible for what i believe in the consequence of my actions based on those beliefs if they're wrong or right and so what level of understanding do i need when experts in the field disagree to even decide where i trust well and i think another question to be asking around that is how [524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=524.73s)

can we discern a person's ability to articulate the complexity as an absolute truth or a part of our truth that we can put into our baskets then later synthesized and not blindly agree because of the poetic feelings i believe that the emotional pole that it allows me to feel and sometimes you know i i have to admit that and these conscious quote-unquote conscious [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=552.84s)

conversations around what's happening to these little pandemics people want to be agreeable with someone who has that ability to articulate complexities mostly for the sake of because it allows them to have some sort of validity and making them feel smarter or more included in that narrative which is really not the reason why you would want to agree to someone's material in the [576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=576.9s)

first place and then what happens is we get a lot of blind knowledge nodding and agreeably to what's happening for somebody and then that becomes the general narrative that leads into maybe sometimes a misled group of people taking unreasonable action in the world and you know we have enough of those clusters going around and then we have everybody going in every which way [602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=602.16s)

direction with a spoon fed and self imposed righteousness attached to it in some way and so i'm curious how can we build our capacities better to bring a higher level of balance into what it is that we can collectively do and pose the the question to even have a question about the information that we're having as we continue this this journey together yeah you as to how question and [637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=637.5s)

there's some very basic things that will create some traction it's not the whole answer but basic things first i'll say something about agreeableness since you mentioned that that the spirit of good [[sensemaking]] of good epistemology is the earnest desire to know and so bias of any kind is the enemy of science or epistemology or or [[sensemaking]] right agreeableness and disagreeableness are [674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=674.87s)

both biases and their relational biases to relate in a particular way with the person but that also means relating with their information in a way that predisposes a particular kind of relationship to that information independent of what the actual truth of it is so there are people who like to be disagreeable who will just figure out [697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=697.22s)

how to devil's advocate you no matter what that's not that useful right because that's a lot of waste of time and energy if what you're saying is actually true and they should and if they didn't have that bias they'd be like oh yeah that actually makes sense and agree ability similarly leads to music echo chambers and people not actually [722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=722.41s)

thinking and so i really like for people to not have either of those biases as much as possible and to separate their desire to have effective relationships with people and their desire to think a particular thing about a particular topic so i can disagree with you well totally respecting you and having a good relationship and if i can't and us both because we're super immature right [750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=750.5s)

and so it's important in a healthy relationship that i can actually say well i can see why you came to that that like i can there's a lot in that that is interesting i come to a different take right they disagree let me tell you how where i'm coming from but i'm not actually having any abrasiveness relationally between us because i'm not identifying with my views and even when [777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=777.62s)

i disagree i'm not sure that i'll be right right i'm saying my current assessment come to a different place than yours but i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt enough then staying in conversation with you right and maybe your perception will change and maybe mine mother so that's something on the bias of agreeableness and disagreeableness on some specific house [797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=797.99s)

before agreeing or disagreeing with someone's perspective you want to make sure that you can steal man their perspective well right straw man means that you rephrase the other person's argument but in a kind of weakened or caricature version that sets up your ability to take it out it's a classic tool of rhetoric and debate right steel matting is the opposite it's [824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=824.409s)

actually trying to make their argument even better than they made it trying to really understand the essence of it and construct it and even more clear and profound and concise and compelling way and so especially if there are a few competing perspectives and you can steal man all of them before coming to your own that's a really good process so you can be like okay i see these two viral [849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=849.099s)

adjusts disagreeing on viral origin it's lab mate or it's not lab mate do i understand the argument well enough to actually recreate their argument clearly where they'd be like oh yes you got it before i agree or disagree or am i agreeing or disagreeing without actually really understanding what that nature paper said or why that nobel prize winner said that thing because it [872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=872.829s)

emotionally hits the biased i resonate with is that i kind of like the conspiratorial biowarfare thing versus i kind of don't like that and if you don't understand it well enough to steal man both sides you shouldn't have a strong perspective you should just say i don't know and just sit in the unknowing and say if i want to know enough i have to study but to have a strong belief where [895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=895.419s)

i don't understand the topic is much worse than just saying i don't know like that's that's the best way to make a jackass out of myself so i would rather say if i want to know enough what does it take to actually be able to know where people who have more expertise than me disagree and there's a bunch of humility that comes in like you know i have a pretty good science background [923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=923.619s)

but when i see two biologists who are both eminent who spent 30 years just studying that topic could disagree i'm like i'm not gonna learn everything they know in a hurry how the would i even think i have a chance of understanding well possibly possibly because they might have became eminent because there are certain biases they do ride that give that makes [944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=944.079s)

and hypotheses and they explore them and so maybe become because i don't know the space as well i have more epistemic flexibility that if i really try to understand their arguments and steal men them i can see something between them with more episode and flexibility i'd be the only hope i would have of reconciling that at all right but that actually ends [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=962.029s)

up working which is pretty amazing i want to just mark what you said there doug and i remember early my early zen training life being told dull i don't know is probably the wisest thing we could say about anything so that that really resonates but the i think that's i think that i think we we kind of feel like we must know or must have an opinion especially about this kovat [989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=989.179s)

thing it seems that and then maybe that's part of the the part of the the polemic of info war in generals it makes us feel like we have to pick a side and that i don't know means that maybe we don't care or something like that i think that maybe it's a it's a higher order of answer period and then the second thing i got on that daniel is it if i want to know it requires an [1012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1012.179s)

investment so it has to be important to me and so that means there's going to be whole categories of since making them maybe i don't engage in and and i do have big pieces of things that i don't know about and then in regards to something that i may be wanting to put into the world or some action i might want to take it might be really really important for me to invest the time to [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1033.37s)

know in the way you're talking about so i think that's really valuable a valuable piece if i want to get buff or i want to learn to paint well or i want to play the piano there's a difference between i want that and i can actually do it well which is called a ton of training yeah and so coming to understand biology and biology and epidemiology and coming to understand [1056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1056.23s)

political science and economic theory well are not trivial right and especially to try to have some grand narratives that synthesize knowing all of those things together now if i say i don't know it could be seen as i don't care i generally take it and sometimes that is right someone doesn't because they really don't give a but it can also be that you care more i [1078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1078.73s)

actually care so much that i'm not willing to have false confidence that biases me because once i start to have i think i know now i just have [[confirmation bias]] where i look for things that confirm that and throw out the other things and surround myself with people that agree with me and if i really care that's the worst thing i could do i ruined my ability to be [1100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1100.73s)

connected to reality at that point instead wanting to just get confirmation of a particular type of social signal from a particular audience that will confirm that for me and so i'd much rather be able to say i really care and i really don't know and that's uncomfortable it's funny it's you said that i just thought of some kind of the of the you know the notion that [1121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1121.94s)

democracy doesn't work without a well-informed public it seems like i don't know may actually be one of the best states of inform that you could be honest about it's the ending of the possibility of a real angry it's the beginning of the possibility of coming to know anything in a worthwhile way yeah great now you know like so so obviously here we are in the state we're [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1146.779s)

dealing with political realities economic realities in some case health health realities that are very disruptive can i say one more thing to rachel's question on the how just one baby a simple simple thing that i'll pick back up on the other than good if there's something you're starting to think is probably true where there is division and belief around it find some [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1169.34s)

people who are really smart who disagree with you and talk to them and ideally people who know the field better than you do and notice one see can i steal man their arguments do they have some data i don't and also notice your own bias am i trying to discredit them instantly am i trying to identify their cognitive biases and say they're conspiracy [1195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1195.169s)

theorists are there a standard model or whatever it is so that i don't have to take seriously the fact that they might be up my confidence right now oh great yeah so considering the impact that this pandemic has had on us and know obviously there's a health impact for some people there's certainly economic and you know political impacts and then an uncertain future impacts is [1218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1218.12s)

is really i think one place that that many of us are standing especially as we starting to look out there like six months or a year or two years three years like you know in an attempt to either a predict the future which i you know we're not a very big fan of but when you actually start looking at you know being generative with your ideas about the future and what might be a [1240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1240.08s)

better state you know what what do you kind of have to offer us and in terms of like you know where are we at now and and what is some of the things that that that are some of the forces that are at work at defining what our near-term future might look like six 12 18 months and then really what are some of the alterations that are that there's actors out there pushing on us and then maybe [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1264.98s)

some things that you're thinking of or we might think of that would be a desirable state to move towards after this this pandemic or after this period of disruption if we just think about the pandemic and the whole conversation around return to normal a lot of things have been really profoundly damaged already and and i don't just mean people who died right and family members and [1294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1294.32s)

emotions and those who depended on them financially and all of those things oh that's a big deal but the number of small businesses that closed the small businesses go out of business for something like this it's a lot like cutting down an old-growth forest you just can't regrow quickly you can fail a business that has small margins much faster than you can regrow a bunch of [1319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1319.22s)

new ones now huge businesses can come in who have war chests and start to buy up that space so that represents you know one of the most severe consolidation of wealth possibilities that we've ever seen similarly when the market crashes and all of the real infrastructural value stocks are really cheap so those who have a bunch of liquid can buy them all up that's again massive [1345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1345.12s)

consolidation of wealth on what was already an unsustainable economic inequality we see that the gdp went down but the debt went up and we already had more of our gdp debt servicing than was sustainable and so that represents basically a you know a fatal blow to an already mostly dead system what happens from that and then we start to look at the damage that's happened to the eu as [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1377.7s)

a system and what that means for eurasia and the belt and road initiative and you know so many things like that we start to look at [[food supply]] chains so if we just got let's say that we got a magical vaccine tomorrow we won't but let's say we did we'd be returning into a world that was radically damaged not by the virus but by all of the second third order effects so if we want to return to [1406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1406.2s)

a not really damaged world we have to fix not just the virus but fix those other things and what it takes to fix those would require a level of people understanding them so would require better [[sensemaking]] and way the better coordination ie governance at both you know nation-state levels between public and private sector and internationally and if we got that we [1430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1430.35s)

could make it much much much better right because those are those would be significant changes to the core civilization systems so we will come out of this different and it will either be meaningfully worse or meaningfully better in terms of the overall health and integrity of the global commons and systems and then looking out beyond that time or looking at is that is this this [1457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1457.92s)

thing that i mean i just want my really clear flat simple question is this is this an opportunity for systems upgrades or championing things that might be of long-term benefit to humanity and the planet yes of course you mentioned when we were talking earlier about you know the frame that some people are holding of the kind of pause that this is right well the most [1485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1485.41s)

powerful actors in the world not only don't have a pause they've increased their activity many fold right the kremlin and the ccp and the dnc and the gop they're not paused right they're  power grabbing like crazy and trying to advance their agendas and doing so with really asymmetric information capabilities and capital capabilities and team capabilities and [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1515.14s)

actuation capabilities so anyone who feels like it's a great pause that also says where you are in the food chain kind of what's influencing the world so i think there's a lot of things that are being advanced that and when you mention opportunity that some people are seeing as opportunities to advance their personal interests in ways they're bad for the interests of others are the [1545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1545.02s)

whole so there are some people who for whatever reason really believe in or like or are aesthetically attracted to authoritarian type structures so when you see you know the president of the philippines when it was time for quarantine just so happily taken say yes shoot people who are violating quarantine it just appeals to a sensibility like his to take [1568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1568.24s)

authoritarian measures of those kinds so and in more technologically advanced countries those same people are looking at implementing massive thermal scans and ai drone type capabilities and surveillance capabilities and how much is just their own personal economic incentive associated being the major you know funders or or owners of those companies and those technologies versus [1596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1596.17s)

is it aligned with political agendas or ideological agendas so there's a lot of people pursuing opportunities but that are not the opportunities that we would say create the highest quality of life for everybody in a good in in what i would call a good [[sensemaking]] frame now there are some people doing things that are authentically really interesting right [1619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1619.7s)

now and it could move things in the right direction but they are not they don't have as much resource they aren't as well coordinated so as the [[food supply]] chains break this is a real interesting one right so we see the coaling which is this very funny sanitized term right : of all the chickens and the pigs and like that and burying the potatoes and pouring down [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1645.34s)

the drain all the milk just as many people exist that need to eat like what the why are we destroying all the supply when there's just as much aggregate demand it's just the demand used to go to mcdonald's right it used to go to a few major distribution centers when those distribution centers can't get it and you're operating on relatively tighter [1666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1666.2s)

margins then the supply side is like well we can't keep paying for these pigs or these chickens if we can't sell stuff so it's actually cheaper for us to just kill them and destroy them but then all the people still need food and like that's just a [[supply chain]] issue right that's a supply intelligence so just can we get the supply to the demand through a different route well the longer the [1686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1686.03s)

route is the easy the more steps there are they can damage it so the movement to say well we should actually have [[food supply]] be more distributed and more local oh and by the way if it's more local there won't be [[factory farm|factory farms]] because nobody wants to be around a [[factory farm]] because they're horrible and so you have to put them somewhere far away and then of course [1709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1709.58s)

that means it's centralized shipping to everywhere else so does that mean that we can get better ethical treatment of animals better environmental care better health for the people and better robustness and resiliency of the [[food supply]] grid simultaneously yeah totally that should happen right and there's some totally inadequate but some movements happening in that direction [1729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1729.98s)

this is an interesting one because this is something where like anyone can engage to some degree right you can just say i'm gonna do a home garden right and that's engaging to some degree or i'm gonna help a community garden in our air i'm gonna help our small towns start working on local resilience like can we get a couple people to start engaging in growing stuff for this region as opposed [1750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1750.62s)

to everything being based on import and export and so there's like there's real local you can do to engage in that at the same time there's stuff that some people need to do to sake who have real [[supply chain]] capabilities and enough money to front the costs to be able to you know meet the supply and demand where it's at so for every one of the places where it [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1773.48s)

could go really bad there's an opportunity right the kids not being at school and the combination of them getting way more screen addiction as a result of more domestic abuse happening as a result of damage happening in their social development like that's pretty bad actually when you think about what that means for a generation is pretty bad but the opportunity to say [1799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1799.79s)

let's we have to fix that and while we're fixing it let's just kind of rethink education from scratch and how do we if we were gonna be delivering education not to the legacy system how would we do it that's a pretty awesome opportunity a bunch of jobs go away and we realize wow there was a bunch of jobs that were really just jobs right like there were just make work [1822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1822.83s)

kind of jobs well if those people can't feed their families they don't care because like it was meeting some need but we also get to say can we start to rethink our like what productive and meaningful work and how people get there you know finances medora so i'd say if you go across the sector's just take health care take you know pick every sector and say what are the risks in [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1847.43s)

this space and what harm has already happened and associated with that to solve the harm to prevent the risks and to make it better what would better look like what are the opportunities in that space that's a valuable thought process great so let's think about you know somebody might be watching this this video right now dan yellin and you know that there may be theirs they've they've [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1871.91s)

kind of got some of the harm in for work has done to our information ecology and they have a sense that i think that it's difficult to make sense but they have a longing or like just a general feeling if they want to be of service you know right now no how did that how do they get started i mean like like and we've talked we're talking you know through the years a lot about consciousness what [1895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1895.85s)

we mean by raising consciousness but they're like what are what are some of those things right now this is a moment where we get to retake we get to take stock where our lives and think about how we might reconstitute ourselves differently than than before you know what are some of the things that that we can look to what are the steps that we might be able to take to be able to [1919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1919.58s)

participate meaningfully in a world that works better or ultimately a thriving room and pause because i know i know statistically that whatever i say even if it is inspiring won't make it through people's memory after they scroll facebook or instagram the first time or get on a phone called it's stressful and so inspiration that isn't gonna last through a bunch of [[hypernormal stimuli]] not worth so much so if i wanted to say what could people do and they would feel inspired after this but then they would lose it the first thing i want to say is well and what could you do to not lose it what could you do to stay engaged in a conversation that would keep orienting you in the right direction so that's kind of meta to the specific thing to do but it's how to be engaged in a way that [1977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=1977.48s)

will keep engaging you so i would say if i had to pick one thing that would have people do is figure out how to engage more often with people and content that are actively doing things that you find inspiring that will orient your attention continuously that way because whether it's facebook or your family or your job or your kids or whatever it is there will be a lot of things that are [2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2006.22s)

orienting you in other directions and being oriented to what is it that i feel really lately called you know which very much might be your kids but from a different frame right what is that i feel most called to engage in i would say figure out how to engage and this is like this is the purpose of church right or the sangha was that you kind of need to keep [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2025.89s)

coming back and having some regular community reminder because humans are social primates and the thing that affects us more than anything is who were around and i know that's why you know in addition to this festival you're working on putting out more content so people can have a regular kind of exposure that's the meta thing i would say i can [2045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2045.86s)

now say some more specific things if you want yeah yeah what do you see so somebody listening to this is a online marketer and somebody's an accountant and someone's a construction worker and somebody is a farmer and somebody's a trust fund kid and somebody's an instagram model they can't all do the same thing right like they have very different skills very [2074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2074.7s)

different knowledge very different calling and so if i start saying okay well here's what we do to restructure global finance well which of those people will that be the really relevant thing for so it's hard to try to speak to a very general audience in that way so what i would say is whatever level of expertise you have and whatever kind of areas of calling there is definitely [2102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2102.99s)

useful you can do if you feel called to do useful things and if you want to do useful things that more scale which is totally not the only thing to do because there's a lot of people who for ego reasons want to think about scale while totally neglecting everything around them and so much so many problems would be better if people were just not neglecting what was around [2124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2124.38s)

them then we wouldn't all be depending upon some scaled things solving all of our problems which is what leads to a few companies and organizations running the whole world who aren't close enough to possibly have the optics to know how to be helpful so might be like well i'm taking care of homeless dogs in my city this doesn't address homeless dogs all cities or all animals but it [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2145.17s)

addresses these ones right and if i can after i do that start to put out here's what we did that was helpful in our city for other cities right like those are good steps so right now with cova there's a lot of people who are lonely enough that they're killing themselves do you and some of them will end up being people that you find out about that you knew right or who are just [2167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2167.579s)

older people were just really suffering so you don't have to have any very specialized knowledge or any high profile sense-making to be able to see where there's need and reach out and be responsive to it so that's a huge thing to the degree that you feel called to things that are systemic question it actually because it's probably wrong i'm saying this is [2199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2199.109s)

someone who's systemically focused but partly that is just because we're not getting local news we're getting global news and so our attention is being bombarded by things that aren't actually in the world that we're in and that are at a scale that we really can't do anything about or even know how to make sense about so it mostly just that is the [[narrative warfare]] at a high level that's trying to get our beliefs so we vote and purchase and retweet in a particular way to support those who are acting at that scale with specific types of agendas and your desire to have a strong opinion and be able to do some online warrior is largely some stronger forces having co-opted you into being a soldier for something you don't even understand [2242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2242.97s)

well i'm it so it's often a distraction tactic actually and then an avoidance tactic that many of us use to not actually do the work onward for us at a very very local level that internal level the home level the direct community level and we distract ourselves with so many of these narratives it can be avoidance it can be you know grandiose gratification it can [2270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2270.29s)

be simply the addictive i can't not know right whatever can be the hypernormal stimulus of osha deletes our drinking baby blood i have to know about that right because it's like it designed to hit all of the big the stuff that's gonna light somebody's need to know up but there will be some people who are supposed to do things at a beyond [2294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2294.69s)

regional level and scope and then it's if you feel really clearly called there what do you have to study to be able to understand the [[problem space]] well enough to understand the solutions well enough to implement stuff if you are wanting to help not just with community gardens in your area but with [[food supply]] so that millions of pigs don't need to be slaughtered one can you even learn what [2320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2320.43s)

you would need to in time right just like reality check that and to the extent that you already have a [[supply chain]] company or whatever and you think maybe you could then it's like okay who are the experts you can bring in right away who are the and especially ones that have dissenting opinions where you again get to ask them the question steel men them come to understand it so that [2339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2339.869s)

you make sure that you understand the [[problem space]] well to craft solutions that make sense so that when you act on it you're acting effectively to the degree that people feel called to act at more scale it's very much like lifting more weight or playing more advanced piano pieces there's more training involved it well said because then we have to have the capacity to do the [2365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2365.339s)

steel manning and that takes time complexity more complexity yeah if i'm if i'm doing a local community garden there will be economics involved who buys the piece of land whatever but i don't need to understand dark pools and complex financial instruments to do it in the way that i do if i'm trying to figure out what's happening with the global economic stimulus right and so [2383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2383.72s)

there is just going to be at scale inherently more things included in the scale that means more complexity well what's so great about complexity even though it can get pretty vast pretty quickly is that it lends a wonderful invitation for collaboration and you can't solve it i'm yeah but i and i do think that one of things that we do skipper [2412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2412.349s)

a lot and i think rachel i'm thinking what you just said is like like when you can collaborate in a local level you can actually coordinate enough people to have enough range of opinions and views and capacities and capabilities it it can be difficult but it's you know organizing a hundred people is very different than than 4,000 or 5,000 which is very very different than 300 million [2436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2436.7s)

or a billion and i think a lot of times especially and a lot of our our world in our movement is we talk in these really grand things and then we don't even do organizing in levels of 10 or 20 or 30 we're the big but not actually engaging them that the local there's a very important part of the classically left-right conversation the left-right was supposed to be a healthy dialectic [2466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2466.7s)

between values that were all important that in the like steel man different perspectives right through this dialectic between rights and responsibilities between individual and relationships rather that dialectic would happen not supposed to be a warfare but you have to balance rights and responsibilities in the right way and either one of them on their own [2494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2494.75s)

without balance and zup becoming pathological so if people have rights and they don't have attendant responsibilities right so you're raising kids they have there's a right that they have to expect that their parents are gonna feed them and their parents start as they have capability progressively they start being involved in helping wash the dishes and do chores there's [2519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2519.17s)

some responsibilities associated with that that teaches them how to be a healthy person an effective person in the world cuz that's going to be the case in the world right do i have a we start talking about everyone should have universal healthcare as a right awesome who pays for it who pays the doctors and the nurses and the hospitals and the diagnostics and builds the mri machines [2536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2536.54s)

now let's start really well the rich wait okay let's just run all of the channels of so whose money is taken by force backed up by guns right which is ultimately what law is is a monopoly of violence and how does that make sense and what types of incentives does that create an anti incentives and just you have to really think through the whole rights [2560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2560.119s)

and responsibilities thing it's one of the reason democracies fail faster than monarchies it generally is and faster than republic's is people will vote themselves rights that they aren't willing to take the responsibility to implement and so then basically everyone is a child right in their consciousness and that doesn't work similarly if people are responsible for something and [2582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2582.05s)

they don't have the attendant rights associated that's some kind of servitude or slavery right so it's important that those things be balanced and so the right side is if i want to operate a larger scale and have people be interested in what i have to say there i kind of have to earn that right if i want to have like having people listen to what i have to say is a like it's a [2607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2607.97s)

there's a privilege that's associated with that but i did i don't have the right to it without the responsibility that i had to take first to offer things of value so one of the things i would say about scale is you earn it you earn operating at scale if that's your calling and it shouldn't be most people's by doing a good job at smaller skills great sensible makes sense i [2627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2627.71s)

think that's a thing it's funny it's like um we you know we we all the time start thinking that maybe we have an idea for large solutions at scale and i know for myself it's like the it's taking me years to actually learn to slow down enough to even ask what i mean when i think i have an idea for a solution scale and you know like the the process of actually examining the [2657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2657.41s)

underlying assumptions and and the and the just huge amount of no data like no proof no data pieces of kind of if you will imagination without a relationship to okay i've imagined something now i need to go check out and and find out if that works now if we're an entrepreneur we say hey i imagine having the the most badass music app ever i'm not gonna get [2681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2681.79s)

a i'm not gonna walk up to an investor and say hey give me a hundred million dollars i'm the most badass music a pepper like i say great here's $1,000 go do something or here's $100,000 go do something show to me that you can in a very small level making something badass a bow i think when we start looking at you know wanting to alter the the systems in which the world operates we [2704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2704.109s)

have that kind of naivete like we're gonna likes if somebody just give me the authority to say how it's gonna be mad i could just fix all of this stuff really really quick and i mean that that's i think that's we would agree that's that's that naivete that ends up making decisions that up worse than it was up before we made those decisions and yet there needs to be some [2725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2725.619s)

kind of lattice worth of framework for us to begin to understand how to try out ideas you know and and and not the old idea is not the you know the past 200 years of retreaded ideas over and over again but and there has to be a way for us to begin to think new thoughts and try new things you know where do we get the space to do that and how do we carve that out of what is know as i think we [2752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2752.71s)

agree as a crumbling society how do we not just hold on to the stones of the things around us and try to keep them from falling down and still have enough space to to try to stand up these things in the world you're saying brings up for me this dialectic between there's a kind of hubris or a audacity people will use those terms to be entrepreneurial and think you can do something has never [2783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2783.94s)

been done but that has to be balanced with the kind of humility of understanding why it's never been done and what attempts have failed by people that were competent and smart and what things have you know yeah there's a very important it it's kind of like when we were saying if i've got two scientists who spent 30 years studying a topic and they disagree how the [2811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2811.75s)

i possibly even imagined that i could come to have a view on it when i'm not gonna study all they studied well there's a certain hubris in that but there's also the humility of i know i don't know what they know but maybe i can come to understand how they constructed the ideas well enough that by being able to take both of their positions maybe more flexibly than they [2830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2830.51s)

do because maybe they hold their own position more i can gain some insight so there's there is a kind of faith in a possibility right that is almost like hubris it's a faith and a possibility that i could do that same as like build a new thing but if i haven't looked at so what are what are all the attempts to try and do that that failed or that ended up going another way because they [2854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2854.0s)

res that was actually the wrong thing to do then it's just almost guaranteed that i'll just fail and waste the energy of the other people who engage given a cross-section of human beings in different places and locations obviously with at least enough for resources to think about the issue who would like to improve things on both local levels and global levels in terms of you know [2880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2880.579s)

healthy healthy environment healthy food healthy lifestyle with a relative amount of safety without actually having the the keys to authority you know you know in the middle of that sandwich not at the top is is there is there something for us to do i mean we obviously have some kind of desire and passion to to you know make a difference or evolve things or set things on a better path [2908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2908.569s)

you know it is i guess is like maybe there is no framework but if there was a framework you know like what what is it that has us have the capacity to do that or is it just allowing the self-organizing universe to - to do its do its work and we actually just have to trust that what we're doing is the right thing to do or that we are effort itself adds up to something i mean do you see [2929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2929.839s)

where i'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place of this daniel it relates to the scale question we asked earlier you're asking a question at maximum scale great i'll reframe them i'll just say that hyperlocal scales for right now because i can certainly imagine that better than i can i mean even at the scale of the cross-section of who we're talking about [2953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2953.42s)

right that's a very huge week it's a very diverse we that have very different interests and proclivities and capacities and access so for me to answer that generalize the level it'll be a very generalized answer which i can do i'll do it but it'll be almost platitude like okay we'll take that and then we'll reframe it afterwards after we see what we see how that that fits [2976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=2976.94s)

great thank you because it's important to note if i was talking with the american retail association what can we do and it's the heads of the large retail businesses we could really talk through with the things that they're capable of doing and what their mandates the shareholders are whatever what could they actually do we could start to map out the opportunity space and [[problem space]] if we were talking to the joint chiefs of staff or the [[national security]] council or a local group of farmers we could answer that right or or the association of accountants or whatever it is right but when it's this broad people don't have a shared sense of what the desirable world is anything more than just like a feeling right is it more libertarian or is it more socialist [3023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3023.71s)

yeah they're more different than most people acknowledge and there's other projects of what we're doing towards it is it more kind of [[permaculture]] a low-tech or super high-tech transhumanist upload my brain to the cloud like even what is desirable is thought very very differently and our levels of understanding of how to advance towards that plus our [3043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3043.27s)

capabilities so i'm just noticing that there there's kind of baked in frames and the way we ask those questions that are worth exploring yeah and i'm just i'm like you know i just wanted to be in the kind of presence to the inquiry kind of moment here and you know you think you talk about you know and i know you don't like to wear an impact you talk about you know impact work or all of [3068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3068.35s)

these things that we use to describe like the things that we're doing but i think in in general i'm just kind of confronted with the fact that it's actually not very well questioned we'd actually don't we don't say what we mean by them we don't or at least we don't have a what have a reliable definition that could be could be shared amongst a lot of people but we speak to [3090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3090.37s)

a spectrum as if there are real things yeah and to an evangelical protesting abortion clinics is doing impact work and to say certain democratically oriented people supporting planned parenthood fundraising is impact work and they're out there two pieces of impact work equally earnestly motivated a direct war with each other right and the same is true about like [3122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3122.01s)

environmentalism and [[climate change]] work versus oil worker rights for an oil union right and so yeah it's just worth thinking more precisely about some of these things we're gonna say no please to take it to even an even smaller scale all right okay we've gone to the cross section to maybe some of these regional spaces and now very niche environments but take it to even a smaller scale i'm [3154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3154.69s)

curious what are some questions that you ask yourself before you decide that you care enough about something to put some effort into knowing about it growing it putting your focus to it so that when people that are listening to this have their own experience and their own self inquiry decide if they they care enough about something like what are those questions to be asking ourselves at that [3183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3183.04s)

time to see if we should be putting our effort or our attention or our study or our intelligence or our heart with what all the things that we can care about because we can care about all of it in in very equal ways but to get down to where we're not just sitting there taking in all the information but actually putting out something what are what are some good questions that we [3209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3209.38s)

could be asking ourselves maybe how are you asking yourself when you choose to do something yeah it's a good question it's interesting though though how that we effects it how different it is when i if i'm at phases in my life where i haven't had any projects i was running and i'm just in an interstitial place and i'm kind of researching so it's just with my own bandwidth right [3239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3239.56s)

versus initiating a project and now there's a team so i have way more bandwidth but i also have way more output it is expected to be able to keep paying that team right whether it's a non-profit or for-profit and to be able to grow the capacity well all of a sudden i'm actually getting more constrained on what we focus on even though there's more more total capacity [3260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3260.619s)

right and this is why they experience it actually running a business or running a non-profit where you're responsible for the finance is a can be a very valuable learning experience is you start to ask okay this seems super fascinating but there are a total of 75,000 hours worth of activity per day we'd like to do and we can't do all of it so what things do i do factoring the opportunity costs of [3292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3292.96s)

the other things i'm not going to do well i'd like to be able to do more total stuff than we actually have the bandwidth to do so if i just use all of our bandwidth doing immediate work we won't grow our bandwidth we're just using it so i have to think about how do i do the things that are immediately needed and things how do we use our bandwidth in ways that grow our [3312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3312.25s)

bandwidth right that show the effectiveness of what we're doing in ways that can grow the team and grow the the financing the legibility the whatever so you think about is this a project we can actually figure out if we're gonna start researching is this a project we can actually figure out well enough to offer differential novel insights do we have the team capability [3331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3331.27s)

to do that and then is this something that if we had those insights we could act on do we have the channels to be able to actuate the things that would be needed or do we just have those insights we're just sitting on them and then the opportunity cost of what other things am i not doing to do this thing right so those are types of frameworks that are very basic but they [3354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3354.529s)

can be valuable to think about the finiteness of time well yeah if your classic two by two matrix even more basic let's just say yeah make it even more basic let's say you're one with two hands and a life choice to make all right very basic and a lot of people are that one person in that one room right now with just two hands and that one life choice to make right now and so i'm [3388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3388.19s)

curious what questions would they be asking themselves about what's in each hand to help them decide on what that one choice it's cuz and maybe that choice for them is like that one thing that they've been kind of putting off their entire life and this quarantine moment is that moment for them to actually make that choice so now the way you frame that as a rephrasing of what [3413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3413.359s)

michael asked because that one person is now the one person avatar of the we which is to everybody because when people are all different again so i will now go to the very generalized answer i said today would and i just want to i just want to point like we're all very smart you know people we've done a lot of study in letting you just like this is [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3437.15s)

hard stuff you you you you actually get things get very undistinguished is again the same question but actually be examined it's not very distinct it's very generalized so let's let's hear the generalize answers even though it may not be a very effective answer i think it's it's worth now at least hearing and exploring that what we're asking is how do humans live a meaningful life right [3466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3466.489s)

like that's the question you're asking is how do different humans who want their life to contribute to the well-being of the whole in some ways have their life actually be well engaged and well used and that is the core of all religious and spiritual and cultural and philosophical kinds of inquiries right so that's why i said what i'm gonna answer is gonna end up being [3492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3492.53s)

pretty general because it's a big question and it's a so a few things i can say the reason i was pointing out that wait are we trying to end all the abortion clinics or make abortions available to everybody is that how to have my life be able to create impact impact towards what what is my fundamental ethical framework of what good is right how do i make sense if not [3515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3515.0s)

just what i think is but what ought and so to inform what i'm going to do there's the science ii side the [[sensemaking]] side of what is the forecasting side of what will be the effect of a specific action and the ethical side of what is a good life what is a meaningful world what what am i wanting to contribute to realizing that most of the things that people do actually elicit [3541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3541.07s)

counter responses and drive wars rather than actually advance anything and then they drive [[arms race|arms races]] and escalating wars and they drive second and third-order negative effects right and so we build a cool little communication app so we can just send these tweets to each other because that seems really like it's kind of cool the short thing and then all of a sudden world war 3 is [3565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3565.16s)

being waged over it because the president is using it news like oh with it those were big unintended consequences of the things that we were doing so so how do we make sense of the world make sense of what is actually good and write and think through the effects of our actions right and then how do we actually act on those things in a prioritized way and how do we [3586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3586.76s)

increase our capacity to keep doing so those are i think some reframes of the underneath the question you're asking if i was trying to be more precise and so the main thing i would say is like there's a there's a development of the humans there's the engagement of us but also the development of us so that our engagement keeps being better guided and effective right and this is the how do i [3610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3610.8s)

know more about what's going on how do i do a better job at prioritizing how do i do a better job of communicating and compelling in effective ways all those things and how do i make sure that what i'm doing is actually what's most meaningful to me and my time isn't just hijacked by habit addiction fear lack of courage distraction and other things right that's one of the that's one of [3643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3643.26s)

the biggest ones is what are the things that are hijacking your attention that on your deathbed will not be some of your highlights right that won't be the like those are the things that i'm really proud of or feel really grateful about and how can you become progressively less hijacked by those also humans have complex motivation right i want to make these amazing [3664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3664.07s)

things happen in the world why well because i want to save all these kids over here why well because i care about those kids that's true but i also want the credit of being the guy who did that because of unresolved kind of wounded ego insecurities stuff where i want that particular credit and i think that chicks will actually dig it and i think i'll make some money in the process [3693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3693.12s)

and it will address the fact that i never got approval for my parents that's i'm projecting on whatever right like motive this complex so typically whenever someone is doing something there's like 10 or 15 different reasons they're actually doing in they're usually only aware of half of them half of them are subconscious even to them and of the ones they're aware of they [3712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3712.14s)

usually only admit one or two in the executive summary of the project statement and so part of it also in terms of how to be more effective is to become more reflective into your own motives and how to heal the things that are actually siphoning energy away right as you grow and heal some of the motives will become deeper and some will become less so you want to know which are the [3735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3735.72s)

ones that are coming from the deepest truth of who i am and which are the ones that are coming from distraction trauma and security and other stuff so there's [[personal development]] to be able to have rather than mixed motives that are doing like two masters issues where it is more like a laser all coherent so i think what i just said is people need if they want to become more [3758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3758.11s)

effective they need to study the topics they want to influence more like if you're really wanting to help with food security stuff you better study soil and agriculture and different types of agricultural systems and why it went the way that it went what are the financial challenges whatever so that you understand what is the [[problem space]] well enough to come up with good [3778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3778.81s)

solutions so you need to kind of actually study the space you need to look at what things you can implement because there's a bunch of stuff you'll only learn by doing and as you start to do it you'll learn in the process a tremendous amount of stuff so what can i implement with my current capacities so that as i'm studying more one i'm having impact now and i'm learning in a [3802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3802.66s)

tangible grounded way and how can i both continuously be reminded of what's most meaningful to me so that i don't get distracted and hijacked it hijacked and how can i be engaged in a kind of [[personal development]] process that makes my motivation itself clearer and so those are the questions i would ask underneath it would give rise to the how can we do good things and my main answer [3829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3829.78s)

would be the easiest way to succeed at that is to interact with people who are succeeding at that better more often you'll be the average of the five people you spend the most time around all the proximity is destiny all those types of statements we are social primates more than we like to admit and that's why we spend our time on facebook and instagram just actually scrolling at pictures of [3854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3854.53s)

other primates right like that's the thing that really captures us is and it's so interesting because what we're it's like junk food where you extract the salt fat and sugar and remove all the nutrients so you maximize the [[hypernormal stimuli]] without any of the real thing and that's what the [[social media]] thing is is it it maximizes the likes and pictures and interaction [3875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3875.38s)

in total number of people while removing almost all actual kinds of real contact and vulnerability that are scary but it shows the longing for social contact and then also the way we're influenced by what we're around so if people want to actually be doing more interesting things so in each of those areas how do i get how do i do the [[personal development]] to have ego and security stuff get in the way less well who is it a therapist is it a group of friends that do inquiry together what is the process is it a church or a song go like what can i engage in that will ongoingly help me structurally built into my life study what groups you know do it i'm gonna move into a rationalist house in berkeley where i'm around people that are doing that all the time i'm gonna [3923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3923.229s)

create a book study groups or whatever it is so that i'm actively engaged in learning things right that are meaningful if i want to get better at actualizing the things i know who are the people that are the most productive that i know where i really respect that and spend time figure out how to be useful to them because they're busy right so figure out how to free [3942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3942.759s)

more of their time than i'm asking for and because i want to learn how they think about the world that makes them so productive so i would say the thing i can offer that is most useful to all this is actually the social hack of don't think you'll do it just through iron discipline do it through actually intentionally doping what you're taking in through your senses regularly which [3971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=3971.17s)

is mostly who i'm a little in a space where i don't want to know the answer to this next question so i'm gonna i'm gonna go for it but i am curious what have you been just kind of ocd wanting to learn about what's that maybe it's keeping you up at night like what's the thing for you and the real real what's the real thing that you are just hyper focused on getting as much information [4004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4004.559s)

as possible right and what's the one learning that just blew your mind about it so far one of the questions that has been very central in my mind lately is how do we how to architecture [[social system|social systems]] that do not reward sociopathy sociopathy narcissism sadism or any other basically power seeking dispositions that also are either like to or are willing to cause harm with the [4054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4054.13s)

application of that power underneath so many of the problems in the world is that the people who are power seeking and willing to use power in ways to gain more power end up being the most powerful people in the world in defining the world and the people who care about the global commons who don't want to cause harm and who want power seeking themselves usually don't get much power [4084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4084.46s)

which means that they don't influence the the the overall dynamics of the space and it's clear to me that we definitely go extinct if that stays true and so this is you know this this is an old question this is kind of the purpose of law right the purpose of law is to collectively define what are the types of really predatory behaviors we agree we don't do and we will we will shut [4110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4110.92s)

those down but of course throughout time it's like a civilization will create an effective legal system and then the legal and governance system the government is supposed to make laws that regulate the very predatory aspects of of markets and personal advantage seeking but then that means that the main goal of those predatory markets is to get around or capture the regulator's [4138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4138.85s)

right which is what we call the watchdog issue so they have to figure out how to hide it right so seven offshore accounts that are hard to penetrate or whatever it is or they have to figure out how to pay for the campaign budgets and pay for the legislators that effect so they've captured the watchdog functionally and so typically the people who are oriented [4164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4164.14s)

to advance personal power are good at finding niches to do so and so then the question is how do we rigorously close all those niches where those types of behavior are never incented and that and don't end up gaining power and the decision-making across the space is actually the the power of choice making is also bound to wisdom wisdom goodness those types of things i could talk about [4196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4196.1s)

this a lot like what doesn't work and what could work and but you asked me what's something i'm thinking about a lot and what's something that surprised me something that surprised me as i started to study this was how much the world is actually run by sociopaths and say this in many cases within say this just basically means sociopath is willing to cause harm to advance their [4233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4233.48s)

goal but the that cause harm isn't the goal but there are some people for whom they have actually kind of fetishized the exercising of their power right and and we've certainly seen heaps of cases of this throughout history it's it's still true it's just generally hidden but the book the dictators handbook is a nice kind of intro to it there's a short little cartoon that somebody made on [4263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4263.0s)

youtube that was really good called rules for rulers but it just explains why it's very hard to have an enlightened dictatorship long term because there's so much power in that those who are most power seeking and willing to use the most underhanded fucked-up techniques will try to sure it and to not lose the position to them you have to be able to think [4282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4282.409s)

through the things that they're thinking through better and engage in some of those tactics and so how how do you not get beaten by warring cultures without becoming a warring culture right and throughout history so many of the peaceful cultures just got slaughtered by the warring cultures or they had to stop being peaceful cultures so like this this question and i used to think [4301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4301.46s)

more just in terms of system disposition well it's based on the nature of what is being incentivized and what's perverse and sense of an externality so we need to create real cost real value costing and those types of things and that's true but i was under weighting how much there is a power-law distribution of economic and political power we're relatively few people have extremely [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4328.429s)

outsized capability relative to most people and what did it take psychologically for them to get there and then that being there they have both the motive and capacity to continue to stay there and what does it take to do that music so these are some of the questions that are on my mind thank you daniel thank [4353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4353.0s)

you for sharing your thoughts and just also i think i want to say that always present in these conversations is kind of a way to think about our thinking to have a little bit of a meta glimpse into some of our habitual patterns of thinking and easy answers and i really appreciated about our conversations that i walk away with more things to think about than i had when i [4380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4380.449s)

started the conversation so i don't walk away with with like oh i learned a bunch of stuff from daniel i use it always walk away from these conversations with i have a bunch of things to think about now and i'll say to our audience here that there's anything in this conversation that is giving you something to think about get a pencil on paper or your device out and write down [4401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4401.57s)

that thing that it's kind of stuck with you you know what is something that that that you might think about a little bit more and i would say you know our conversations my you know as a as a successful artist a director a thinker you know some of the conversations we've had have taken me years to sort through the kinds of questions i wrote down after a single [4428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4428.51s)

conversation and that to me you know you're saying hey can you be around somebody that that thinks differently they do that offers you an opportunity to upgrade your thinking or upgrade your [[sensemaking]] it i says it's not just listening to you it's actually being willing to grapple with something you said and i would be willing to bet that some of things i've grappled with you [4448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4448.13s)

didn't even know you said to me in a certain degree and i've taken me a long way and and it's actually driven a lot of growth and i think that's what that's what we hope you know that's the building out projects really about is how do we help each other to to lean away from the easy answers and lean into the things that we have to grapple with and and out of that there's a maybe [4467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4467.09s)

maybe misplaced and hopefully not misplaced belief that we can actually move the whole thing towards thriving for for greater numbers of people and in regards to your last point that we can have people that aren't sociopaths make a larger contribution to the world with it can i add something to what you just said my goal is it yeah i think people sometimes think that learning is mostly [4496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4496.06s)

this process of reading or watching something or taking in information and it's actually mostly the grappling with it it's mostly the digestion and processing where it becomes your own and the most insightful thing do you usually get from a book wasn't written in the book it was your own insights that came from really contemplating and then researching and checking it out and so [4515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4515.06s)

you know we all know this in learning theory that when you start to teach something you start to learn in a new way because now you have to you have to be able to explain the questions and you have to do something with it right and this way so often someone will read something and they can recall a very small percentage because it there hasn't yet been an evolutionary impulse to say [4536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4536.33s)

this matters enough to remember it because i was just reading it but when i think about why is this relevant what will i do with it it starts to kind of neurologically store differently so in general when i'm reading i actually read pretty slowly because i'm reading something and then i'm looking up references and then i'm [4558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4558.98s)

thinking about it and i'm relating it with various other things that i've known and so it's more like reading as the center of a research process right and the difference my friend jordan hall talks about simulated thinking versus real thinking simulated thinking is i'm running a thought and then i'm saying maybe it's this other thought and i'm just running other i'm [4581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4581.719s)

running thoughts that have all entered my head from some external place that's not really thinking in right that's basically weighing memes and deciding which ones to propagate real thinking is going to result oftentimes in me having insights that i didn't intake from anywhere and that's like what really is the answer i don't know let's not just pick through the ones that i've heard [4605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4605.33s)

let's say how would i even come to get clear on this and what is my basis to think through it so the beginning of really thinking very important and even insofar as that this so the most important thing is that your your study process your [[sensemaking]] process will be largely mining your own sensing right it'll take something in but then minding your own capability as far as this [4626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4626.69s)

direction of just what you take in goes because we mentioned this i just want to share a very like simple most people have probably heard this but not done it yet thing that is we'll probably do more for you than anything else we've talked about today if you do it take the [[social media]] apps off your phone if you keep your [[social media]] keep it on your computer but just don't don't have it [4649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4649.91s)

continuously available to hijack your attention if you want to do art if you want to start your thing whatever the  it is don't have something that can continuously engage your attention so that you don't get to just be bored and then think about the thing that you care about so take them off your phone turn all the notifications off on your phone or almost all of them if you want text [4670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4670.16s)

or whatever term and then if you keep [[social media]] reconfigure it where you go through your feed and start unfollowing everything that is not making you a better person by seeing it and then intentionally go find the things you want to learn about and follow them and make sure you're curating dissenting views smart dissenting views so you should be seeing [4693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4693.34s)

things that actually kind of bother you but are thoughtful those couple steps will start to help a lot yeah i can second the turning the notifications off on this thing and then i mean there's a lot to say about that but there's some really simple things that that can make a big difference in the quality of life at a very very short period of time so thank you for that thank you for your [4724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4724.26s)

time tonight really you know like you know i could just want to share with our audience how much we appreciate your your willingness to continue into the dialogue into the conversation and even even when it's not always there's not even a answer to give in these questions of being willing to give it a go and kind of share a perspective a place that one human being called daniel standing [4747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4747.91s)

in and how you see things it they think it's that it's really invaluable and if anything if we could be learned to begin to stand in those places ourself and kind of speak with some similar clarity i think we would see some up leveling of at least our dialogue if nothing else so thank you for that and thank you rachel was really great to have this conversation and i look forward to [4771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjChfAJy0g8&t=4771.04s)

talking to you again daniel i appreciate you all hosting these conversations and inviting everybody and inviting me music you
