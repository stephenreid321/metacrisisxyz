hello and welcome to our video explaining the [[third attractor]] framework by daniel schmuckenberger that we keep talking about in our in our sessions so dennis martinberger recorded two videos on the rebel wisdom podcast and called it in search of the [[third attractor]] meaning that we're steering towards two attractors currently we'll talk about later in the series or in this video and looking for the [[third attractor]] what that could even be he doesn't have the solutions he just wants to point out what the criteria etc could even look like so first of all what is this video series about here you see the thumbnail of the first video he calls it an overview so it's not the specific details it's not the solutions it's just an overview on some of the catastrophic wrists the current the [44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=44.82s)

world currently faces and what could be criteria for potential solutions to what he calls the [[metacrisis]] so this is in short what it is about um so what are we going to talk about in this video first i want to point out a couple important frameworks before we go into the depth of the the knowledge i want to talk about the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] we're currently facing but the [[metacrisis]] real quick the two current attractors that we're going towards and a possible phototractor what criteria could be what tools could be etc so let's start one of the important frameworks he talks about is the great game of power so we hear about a lot of um yeah games being played but who the actual [88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=88.619s)

big uh participants in the game are up for debate i would say so he points out a couple of criterias or three criterias what people that want to participate in this great game of power globally need to have so some nuclear capability is one of the surefire uh criteria so if you have nuclear bombs like you will be part of the great game of power um some ability to influence innovative governmental organizations is part of it as well or dominating one or more aspects of [[exponential tech]] because that is um as we're going to hear quite a bit one of the key aspects to many aspects of the [[metacrisis]] so what kind of strategic actors are part of this game great game of power we [135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=135.42s)

have hyper individ uh hyper agents which are individuals um think of putin biden i mean there's many behind the scenes as well but just individual people that have a lot of power uh either influencing governments or dominating some part of exponential tact we obviously have institutions like the cia and we have agrigors which are nothing but the mimetic tribes if you [160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=160.14s)

don't know about medic tribes there's a great um article on by the store i think it's on medium where he explains what the medic tribes are what we have there's over 30 tribes in today's world super interesting um check that out okay what are multiple traps um [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] are basically something where there's a [[perverse incentive]] and i have to use it otherwise the other person does it and i just simply lose out and i'm not part of the game anymore so what what he often mentions is a first mover advantage for example cutting a forest down if i don't cut the forest down then my competitor will do it we'll do it just as quickly he will have all the gains [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=203.159s)

and be able to even cut more of the forest down so if i don't cut the forest down as well and just as fast then i will just lose out to him and the force will be cut down anyways something some another example is the penal penalization for risk assessment so if i want to be the first to market then i will have a huge advantage over my competitors but if i want to be sure [226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=226.799s)

that there's not any any risks involved that i don't know of yet and i want to do a real solid risk assessment first i again i just lose out the competitor who doesn't do it is first to the market has a huge advantage a third example is the armed [[arms race|arms races]] let's say there's a new technology for a weapon i can be like yeah no i don't want to do that because that's just too [249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=249.659s)

dangerous maybe like ai drones or something but if i don't do it my another country does next war i simply lose it's over so [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] is something where it's not evil individuals that take evil decisions it's just something where i don't do it then somebody else does it and then we both lose anyways so it is having to abuse as [[perverse incentive]] um and not really having an option of not doing it so [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] are really at the core of many of the problems we have and it's one of the ways of of explaining these sometimes at least controversial decisions with something that's not just hey they are evil it's something it's part of the underlying problem another important framework are the types of structure [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=293.52s)

used in a society so on one hand we have all the physical technical aspects so that's our infrastructure all the technologies we use from water food energy supply transportation etc we also have the [[social structure]] so those are our coordination protocols our institutions our institutions and our government body and we have the [[superstructure]] so the our shared values our culture our spirituality um some more on a psychological level than on a physical all of these are inter-affecting each other and as we'll hear later to to create any new type of of civilization structure all three of these have are going to have to be affected so let's talk about the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] for a second so what [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] that are really catastrophic to all of civilization are there well first of all obviously nuclear war so if we have a nuclear war happening there's not much uh further life to be expected we have all the [[climate change]] and environmental issues is it topsoil depletion ocean that zones pollinators biodiversity [[species extinction]] there might be some debate as to how critical the [[climate change]] as such actually is um but there's not a debate that we have some some problem in our environment for sure another key aspect are the fields of an [[exponential tech]] we have ai which we're now seeing with chat gpt um just how much influence that might be having in [[social media]] uh sooner or later where you can't really say what is [386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=386.4s)

real what is not and what somebody just created with an ai we have all the the weaponry aspects of ai so a drone with with the eye it's just a whole new level of warfare but we also have biotech and nanotech um already mentioned drone and cyber warfare so there's just a lot of we have a lot more power in with tech not with technology and there's a lot more risks associated with it we also [412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=412.139s)

have the simple intersection of economic of an [[economic system]] requiring [[exponential growth]] with a planet reaching [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] so our whole system is is based on [[exponential growth]] of our [[economic system]] but our planet is is not infinite so we can't just grow in uh exponentially forever we're going to reach some some boundaries so let's talk about the [[metacrisis]] what is the [[metacrisis]] it's the connectedness of all the before mentioned [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] so it's not that we're having one issue and one crisis in one part of the world we have all of these crises to crises i don't know but the plural is of that together and um they're connected with each other that's the problem it's not just their [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=455.819s)

with this one little problem here and there's one little problem there no it's underlying problems that create all of these crisis uh yeah afterwards so what are the underlying issues it's exponential technology we have so much more power than we used to and it's really come to a point where we can actually destroy our whole civilization um with it our problem solving as such [477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=477.66s)

so the way we we actually go about problem solving in our governments is just mostly completely wrong we don't have well thought out solutions to to groups of problems we just have two participants that are screaming at each other and we have to vote for one of those that's not how it's supposed to be and our group and our sessions are actually one of the aspects trying to [500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=500.16s)

make better problem solving with [[collective intelligence]] we have unprecedented times due to globalization so many civilizations have ended or collapsed in in the history of humanity however we've never had one global civilization that it was completely interconnected so if this one fails that's kind of it it's it's over our [520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=520.32s)

whole civilization just collapses we have the kind of related to the exponential technology we have the power of gods without the wisdom of god so we actually have the power to destroy the whole planet but have we gotten that much wiser to actually be able to use that kind of power schmuckenberger argues not and i guess i would agree we don't our our sins making and our wisdom [543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=543.0s)

has not even closely developed as fast as technology has and now we have literal apes uh with the with nuclear bombs so yeah just think about that multiple traps we we talked about before those are also one of the underlying issues um why we have this this [[metacrisis]] so the whole series is called in search of the [[third attractor]] why in search of the [[third attractor]] well first of all because we have two current attractors that we don't really know where we're going but neither of them are great and we don't really have what the the [[third attractor]] will be so let's look first at what are the two current attractors one of them is catastrophe if we keep doing uh kind of the decentralized slow choice making so with [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=591.3s)

our um not ideal government bodies with the the type of democracy we have right now um it's kind of decentralized but it's very slow and there's just we're not even close to having all the decisions to to get out of all the crises we're in and with exponential technology we have a lot of destructive power in a lot of different hands so we used to have the [616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=616.2s)

mutual assorted destruction between the the soviet union and the usa and either one of them knew that if the other presses the button it's game over for both of us so we just don't do that now this this destructive power has been decentralized a lot more than it used to be so now we don't just have [[mutually assured destruction]] but we have so many powers with not just nuclear bombs but with very destructive powers that this is just not a an opportunity anymore so this doesn't doesn't work anymore and will lead sooner or later to catastrophe the other attractor is [[dystopia]] so if you do it like china for example with their centralized fast choice making it's basically one person taking all the decisions which has its advantages [664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=664.86s)

because you're actually a lot faster with this this choice making and i mean if you look at topics like education or i guess economics as well even though i don't know enough about that in china it partly they're doing very well and they're kind of even tick tock just how tick tock is used in china compared to how it's used in in other countries they actually use it to to show engineering [689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=689.1s)

projects and how to to be a better person etc but this all comes at the cost of no individual freedom so if you actually centralize all the power maybe even globally to the wef or wherever you wanna wherever you want to do that um that the individuals around the world will suffer do you basically just some entity controlling whatever happens and [711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=711.48s)

in order to be able to do that the individuals can't have any power so currently we're either going to catastrophe or we're going to [[dystopia]] either we just keep letting all the problems simmer and we can't really do anything about it and sooner or later something's going to blow up and we're all going to blow up or we're going to a dystopian direction where somebody takes [732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=732.06s)

all the power necessary to actually be able to make all of these decisions that are necessary but we lost all of our freedom in the process so what is the [[third attractor]] the quick question the quick answer to that question is we don't know daniel schmuckenberger does not have the solution what the [[third attractor]] is but he has some criteria on what he would be [753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=753.24s)

able to to entail so one of them it's able to prevent all human-induced catastrophes so in order to be a legit [[third attractor]] we can't blow ourselves up so that would be one of the criteria it would also require a coherent choice making factoring the total [[collective intelligence]] with the speed and coherence a small number of agents would have so in it's quite the sentence in in general the more people you try to to have making a choice the the slower it is the less people so just a small number of agents would have the faster it is but we want the intelligence of the collective and and the with the speed of of individuals so some type of of ai supported decision-making process not that the ai takes the decision but [805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=805.38s)

that it prepares kind of the problem-solving process as such um without any having having this type of fast [[decision making]] without any uh centralized power that would be one of the the criteria as well and that is the things one of the aspects of what we are working on to really improve the processes of [[collective intelligence]] and collective [[sensemaking]] um yes harmonizing the ability to hyper agency while focusing on collective well-being so it's not me versus you and i have to take some some [[perverse incentive]] in order to to be even able to sustain my hyper agency but i can sustain my hyper agency while also really being able to focus on collective well-being and the the fourth one the fourth [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=854.04s)

criteria it has to be on all three levels as we said before infrastructure social [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]] so not a small task but at least gives us some criteria of how to look at it he also gives us a couple of potential tools in the end it is all systems of [[collective intelligence]] and education we have to use our [[collective intelligence]] which we're able to do now with the internet um and use it for for just better [[sensemaking]] and and also education so education is one of the aspects he focuses on the more people know the better the collective [[sensemaking]] so using technology it could be ai delivering some mentoring from anybody in the world from any time so imagine [896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=896.459s)

just asking albert einstein about the basics of physics or whatever this will be possible in not too much time so ai is really could be one of the next steps for for an insane level of education but also [[collective intelligence]] we need to have new ways of problem solving um and ai could also be a focus on facilitating that how do we approach each other what are the the real issues [923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgZryO5nXc&t=923.88s)

of the [[metacrisis]] and what can we do to to solve them so that is it that's just a short overview on what the [[third attractor]] framework from schmuckenberger looks like we'll keep talking about it in our discussions but now you have a basic understanding of what it's all about thank you
