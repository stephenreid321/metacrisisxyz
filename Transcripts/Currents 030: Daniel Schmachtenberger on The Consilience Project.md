howdy this is jim rutt and this is the jim rutt show music this is a current episode currents are shorter and less heavily produced than our full-length episodes and generally focus on a single topic as always links to books articles and organizations mentioned are available on the episode page at jimrudshow.com that's jimrutshow.com [25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=25.72s)

today's guest is daniel schmokenberger one of the deepest and best thinkers i know about how we build a better future for humanity daniel's been on the show twice previously back in ep seven one of my earlier episodes we talked about the future of technology and then at ep 80 daniel and i spent a good amount of time talking about [48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=48.719s)

better [[sensemaking]] today we're going to talk about the consilience project a new kind of information service that daniel and his associates have launched can think of it as one part journalism and another part education it's really interesting and maybe something that can really change our world for the better [67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=67.68s)

you can check it out at consilienceproject.org in the interest of full disclosure i've been an advisor to the consilience project since near the beginning welcome daniel hey jim it's good to be here and talking with you again uh one of the people i most enjoy talking to in the world so it's great to have you back so the [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=86.32s)

conciliants project why and what yeah so i'm gonna try to connect three things because it's wire and water clear but it's um it's a little bit abstract the three things are the unique problems the world currently faces in a uh [[exponential tech]] digital globalization world that it never faced previously one two the new problem-solving capacities the world needs to solve these kinds of problems factoring the complexity and scale and speed and nature of them which means new institutions new social institutions and kind of governance capacity and [125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=125.2s)

three the cultural prerequisites for those new institutions and capacities to actually arise from the people as opposed to some people and be imposed on everyone else with the power that [[exponential tech]] makes possible for asymmetry so we say that ultimately what the consilience project is trying to do is [145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=145.28s)

to support a new cultural renaissance or new [[cultural enlightenment]] where uh people understand the uniqueness of the issues the world faces currently well enough to develop in themselves and work to help develop in society the capacities to make sense of the world to communicate effectively with other people to [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=169.68s)

fundamentally develop the capacities to part to develop and participate in new systems of problem solving and governance so that those new institutions actually arise in a bottom-up way rather than an imposed way that are adequate to the problems we need to solve in time so that that looks like can we define [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=189.36s)

the [[problem space]] well enough that it gives rise to design criteria for new systems so that people can start participating and what what might the development of those new systems and new capacities look like so is it uh you know how does it differ and and how does it go beyond what we [208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=208.56s)

currently think of the role of the press and the role of continuing education so if we think about what the role of education and press in any society are we can we can see that a society has a bunch of any society or civilization from a tribal one to an empire to a nation-state has a bunch of activities that people need to do to maintain the [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=231.92s)

civilization so the role of education is the development of those capacities that the society needs to run in the population and the passing of them on generation to generation our colleague zach stein talks about it as civilizational autopoesis but there is a unique set of roles for education in an [[open society]] a democracy a republic relative to a closed society where the people are not only developing some labor capacity or some market capacity but also the capacity to participate in governance if it is to be a government up for and by the people so there's additional knowledge that they need to be able to engage in the issues that government is governing on and so both education in terms of how to understand and think about those things and then the [[fourth estate]] to be informed about what the current state of affairs are well enough that you could possibly have something like a government formed by the people there are uniquely higher levels of both of those that are required for [291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=291.28s)

an [[open society]] to function well than there are for a closed society so like what we're doing here is not trying to replace or do the job of the [[fourth estate]] which we couldn't begin to do it's a humongous job needs done by in lots of different ways when you think about local news and news within specific domains and all like that nor are we going to try to [312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=312.4s)

do the job of [[public education]] or anything like that we're going to try to help in a series of more theoretical pieces help people understand what is the role of education for any civilization like understand that more fundamentally what is the role of a [[fourth estate]] or the knowledge commons for any civilization specifically what is it for an open civilization how have both the educational system and the [[fourth estate]] eroded in the u.s and in the west over the last number of decades what were the steps of them eroding show how the problem landscape has complexified and people's understanding and quality of civic discourse has [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=352.24s)

decreased rather than increased which means you don't even really have the simulation of a republic anymore only the story of it but where almost no one understands the issues about which government is governing and then start to spec out what would an adequate [[fourth estate]] well with an adequate educational system for the future of the world we currently face which is very different than the founding fathers faced or any previous civilization faced so for instance with regard to education in a world post technological automation which is now inexorable in more and more domains there's a lot of jobs you don't [386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=386.96s)

have to train the people to do you program the machines to do them in a world post information singularity where people can't process all the information to be subject matter experts in the same way in a world post ai what is the unique role of humans in that world and what is education for humans in that world to be able to [404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=404.479s)

have a synthetic intelligence meaning synthesizing unique human intelligence with whatever the computational capacities are so what we're trying to do is spec out these things what are the fundamental institutions that make a civilization work why are the previous civilizations inadequate to the current problem scape whether we're talking [424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=424.72s)

about feudalism or socialism or communism or capitalism or whatever like we can show when the scottish enlightenment was thinking about theory of markets they didn't have ai drones and facebook and the unique issues we have to face today and we can show that as the best version of theory of market still catastrophically fail under the [446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=446.16s)

current landscape as do all of those other systems so we want to make sure that we understand them well enough that the meaningful insights are factored right the traditional side but we also understand the novelty of the problem landscape well enough to say what problem-solving capacities don't exist there and what [462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=462.319s)

innovation in our social technology is required to adequately hold the power of our physical technology makes a whole lot of sense now let's not underestimate the founding fathers you know uh madison and jefferson in particular uh argued in franklin that uh democracy or they actually didn't like the word [482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=482.879s)

democracy or they talked about a republic uh was only uh possible to the degree that you had a educated uh citizenry and and and a press uh that could bring the issues honestly before the public and uh so they understood the fundamentals on the other hand your questions about scale and [503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=503.199s)

complexity are entirely right for instance i like to point out that in uh in 1776 the largest business in what is now the united states was a shipyard in philadelphia that employed a little bit less than 100 people and so the the asymmetry between the power of the largest business enterprise and [523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=523.919s)

one human or one family or one hamlet was understandable 101 or 20 to 1 if you compare it to a family today we're talking about amazon versus you and me and uh yeah that's uh how many what is that uh uh six more seven five more orders of magnitude at that point uh we get into we talk [544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=544.959s)

about in [[complexity science]] where quantitative differences become qualitative uh when they're that big so we we really do live in a new world and not only is it a new world in terms of scale today but it's also uh the derivative is also way way higher because while 1776 1789 etc the world was moving faster than it had [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=569.2s)

been moving in 1625 it wasn't moving anywhere near as rapidly as it started to accelerate into the 19th century into the 20th century and now in the 21st century in many domains though not all it almost feels some days like it's going straight up so we have to deal with much larger [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=587.2s)

power asymmetries and we have to uh deal with vastly more [[complex system|complex systems]] and we have to on top of all that i mean that that alone would be a lot big stressor on our relatively limited cognitive powers but we also have to put all that in the cons in the context of uh not only a high first derivative [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=607.44s)

but probably still a positive second derivative you said something super important and i just want to underscore it because it might not be instantly obvious for everyone of the changes in quantity can cross thresholds where they become changes in type or equality so let's take the progression of [627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=627.12s)

military capacity from tribal warfare on into the modern day uh of course it was just a continuous evolution in the magnitude of the capacity for um mediating warfare going from a catapult to a cannon to a you know whatever and there's this natural [[arms race]] that occurs where someone develops a better capacity the other side needs to develop both that same capacity advance it and develop counter weapons but then you get to world war ii in the nuclear bomb and even though the idea that we're just making bigger bombs we're just making bigger destructive capacity as it can is a continuation so there's a continuity with the past of [668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=668.959s)

destructive capacity and kinetic warfare it's a discontinuity in that we never had the ability to actually destroy the habitability of the planet with any of our weapons before the scale of them got to the scale of the habitability of the biosphere and all of a sudden it's like oh that's a whole different thing this a local war is no longer just damaging [685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=685.68s)

to the local people it's actually damaging to people as a whole and so uh you know world war ii was the beginning of human self-induced [[existential risk]] being a real thing even though for all of human civilization before that every human civilization failed the the mayans at a certain point failed the aztecs the egyptians romans [704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=704.399s)

but it was a local failure and then the bomb was the beginning of like oh actually we can create global failure now so that was simply a change in magnitude but a magnitude change it was a change in type that meant a whole previous [[social system]] didn't work anymore meaning that adjacent empires ward as a way to deal with conflict you study the history of [721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=721.68s)

europe and it's just a you know like it's very often studied as a history of warfare where the major empires are continuously fighting same if you study the history of the warring regions period of china or you know anywhere in the world but as soon as the bomb comes you have a first time in the history of the world that major empires aren't allowed to [739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=739.839s)

fight whether because they can't win it's un fundamentally unwinnable a [[mutually assured destruction]] type situation so you're like we need new social capacities that involve not war when we only know how to do it with war so then that was the bread and woods world and okay well can we become does that new [755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=755.04s)

tech also allow us to do this thing called globalization and become so technologically and economically interdependent that war isn't profitable and and simultaneously that we can grow gdp so rapidly because of that globalization that we don't need to ward to get more stuff everybody's desire for more can happen just through [774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=774.959s)

massive positive sum dynamics you run that for about 75 years it succeeded in no full-blown world war three just proxy wars and you get to the point that you start hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] from that type of exponential positive sum on a finite space which again was never an issue before we never had enough people power tech [793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=793.2s)

to outfish the whole ocean even if we outfished a lake and uh and then you also get to the place where the the whole world is dependent on these radically complicated global [[supply chain|supply chains]] where a break in one place can create cascading failures which we started to see with kovid and now we can see that that [[bretton woods]] model post world war ii is coming to an end it can't continue to mediate where we go next and so now the question is what is next and these types of change in magnitude that become then a change in kind that are both continuous with and discontinuous with the past are why we need to make sure we [829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=829.04s)

understand all the thinking of the scottish enlightenment and marx and others critiques of it and the founding fathers and the nordic models and that we need to understand what they got right but we also need to understand where they didn't have these problems to deal with even the [[bretton woods]] architects didn't have these problems to deal with we need to understand these problems well enough that we say what would adequate problem solving that can really solve them in time and without externalizing other problems of becoming catastrophic which we usually tend to do what would that look like and how do we give rise to those new social institutions and capacities that's a damn big question right you know i like to point out that game a which i conveniently say started on february 25th 1694 uh what the hell right with the establishment of the bank of england uh but also the development of calculus the glorious revolution a number of other things it's amazing to remember how poor and how small humanity still was at that time most people lived in dirt floored houses if they had houses at all choking smoke from poorly designed wood fire fireplaces etc and so the the idea of worrying about the limits to growth was laughable uh rather game a's [903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=903.92s)

mission mission accomplished by about 1955 in the west was to you know solve the problem of a tolerably good life uh for pretty much everybody again that was just the west uh and there were certainly people who were who failed uh to be part of that but unfortunately game a did not have built into its operating system any [925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=925.6s)

breaks because it didn't need any when it started and as you lay it out we have the military limit we had to sort of invent some very ad hoc breaks uh called uh mutual assured destruction which we had uh secretary of defense bill perry on the uh podcast not long ago and he was [942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=942.56s)

pointing out them bombs are still there and there are a whole bunch of failure modes where they could go off so we didn't actually solve the nuclear annihilation problem we've just kind of fiddle with it and managed to survive we haven't really solved it uh certainly the atmospheric boundaries uh the [[species extinction]] boundaries what i love to uh bring forth because just so startling is that by far the majority of large mammal mass on earth now is humans and our domestic animals for birds it's even greater about 85 of the mass of bird flesh on earth is uh our domestic foul and when we're [983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=983.12s)

at that level uh there's there's not much room for us to up and uh and not destroy the ecosystem in a way that can no longer support anything close to the 88 billion people uh we have on the world today uh more likely we fall back to something on the order of a billion and the question is uh in the chaos uh that ensues [1003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1003.92s)

in going from eight billion to one billion does anybody survive yeah uh so anyway i was going to move on now into the a little bit more of the meat of okay what is this consilience project got some you know hellacious big uh goals let's save the world from three or four or five uh sure death of civilization risks if we [1023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1023.68s)

uh don't manage them correctly uh what does the consilience project actually consist of what is it yeah totally obviously to even try to think about these problems well is a big challenge that said what we're trying to do is a relatively tiny part of that but that we hope [1042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1042.799s)

is catalytic for a lot of other parts that need to happen one more kind of theoretical thing one way of thinking about the fundamental problem that we're interested in uh discussing how do we solve is and this is um jordan hall who introduced uni and was part of original [[game b]] crew with you uh said it this way when you talked about our legacy toolkits being inadequate uh to the uh problem-solving needs a way we could say it is that our problem solving processes either fail the current [[catastrophic risk]] landscape fail to solve the problem at all or they cause worse problems additional [1088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1088.24s)

problems and cumulatively worse problems in the process of solving it and so what we fundamentally need are new problem-solving processes not the application of the problem-solving process of how do we make businesses and markets how do we make legislation within nation-states [1104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1104.4s)

how do we make philanthropic solutions within the nonprofit world that cumulatively all of that is not cutting it up to the task and so as you were mentioning the earlier problems that humanity was trying to solve it solved and all the major problems that we face today are the result of how they solved it right how do we increase the [1124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1124.16s)

gdp and the wealth and whatever of everyone is where all the environmental issues come from how do we increase our near-term [[national security]] drives [[arms race|arms races]] into existential weapons that nobody had before and so this question of and and one way of describing it is that historically we're used to defining a [1146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1146.4s)

problem that we're going to go about solving in a fairly narrow way it's either a problem for our nation's people but not other nations people it's or for people but not the environment or for one set of metrics like we're going to solve co2 because that's really the issue but we aren't paying attention to the [1164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1164.08s)

other things that are adjacent and the generative processes so we come up with a solution that will sequester co2 or benefit the economy short term or whatever it is but if it is to really solve the problem if it is to overtake it starting after the problem started it has to be faster larger in some way it has larger order [1181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1181.44s)

of magnitude to be able to overtake it if it then affects the [[complex system|complex systems]] in ways other than the intended metric that's where the externality occurs so can i use nitrogen fertilizer to plant a bunch of co2 sequestering plants that capture co2 in the short term but increases the rate of [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean or can i use a carbon credit process where if some [1204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1204.48s)

countries agree to it and other countries don't you change the relationship of the great game of power and if the ones that don't are running technologically empowered autocracies you say and trying to address [[climate change]] we're gonna let the give [[open society|open societies]] up and then this is largely [1223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1223.36s)

why the problem solving doesn't even work is because some people recognize the harm being externalized somewhere else and then lobby against it and then you get almost all of humanity's energy not coordinating but being used up in infighting as heat um and so how do we define our problems and the inner connectivity of the problems well enough that we can come up [1242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1242.799s)

with solutions that are actually viable enough that don't externalize harm in ways that will get people to resist them and uh and that don't create worse problems as we go so that's like the set of core inquiries that we're really trying to work on so what are we trying to do towards that [1260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1260.88s)

i as much as the world as much as a lot of people think that we're too aware of our problems and we just need to focus on solutions i actually think that it's a very deep misunderstanding of the real nature of our problems that is one of the keys people think the problem is [[climate change]] or the problem is systemic racism or whatever the thing is that they're focused on but what are the generative dynamics that give rise to it and how is it interconnected with the other issues in the world where if you try to change it in a particular way it will externalize harm elsewhere and [1296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1296.4s)

or fail so the problem isn't [[climate change]] or u.s china relationships or gdp or it's how all those things fit together and the under and the system incentives of the underlying systems so what we're trying to do is to actually explain the [[problem space]] of the world today clearly enough that it gives [1314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1314.88s)

the design criteria of what new [[social system|social systems]] new social capacities problem-solving systems like what would the future of something like markets and governance and like that look like how do we go about solving problems differently and we're basically doing this in a a series of articles right so uh just to answer your what is the [1335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1335.039s)

consensus project it's a non-profit project and it basically has two major branches it has a publishing branch and it has a movement catalyzing branch the publishing branch is publishing three types of articles and then hopefully converting them into other forms of media that are accessible to wider audiences because the [1354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1354.0s)

initial work is deep enough and it's intended to be deep enough that people can actually start to decentrally understand the problems well enough to work on solutions which means they're not accessible to everybody but the translation of those into podcasts and into even animations and like you and i [1372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1372.08s)

were just talking about uh some of the writing you're thinking of and the smart 15 year old being able to get it we're we're definitely thinking about and hoping to do that as well on the publishing basically we have three types of articles we have the theoretical pieces the foundation series uh as you suggested in naming and we have situational assessments and we have meta news the foundation series is discussing the uniqueness of the problem landscape and what we understand about social theory and helping to reify the previous social theories what they're really good at and where they're still inadequate to the future landscape so we dissolve [1414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1414.159s)

the we just need a libertarian system or we just need dutch socialism for the whole world or here's why the taiwanese model will work for everyone or we want to be able to say here's the strong parts of those arguments here's the failure cases and here's what's actually possibly next for everybody to then disagree with or [1430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1430.08s)

agree with or innovate on or add to so that's those pieces instead of doing it as a big book we're doing it as a whole series of articles that we'll be discussing things on the fundamental design needs for education for the [[fourth estate]] for governance for resource allocation those types of things where some someone can start this at any point [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1453.279s)

they don't have to start a book they can start at any point that they're interested in and then all the articles are interreferential and so there's this kind of interconnected uh body of work that is logically consistent that they can follow different ways those are the theory pieces then there [1469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1469.039s)

are situational assessments that are applying that social theory to look at the current issues in the world the great kind of game of power between us and china the movement from traditional finance to crypto finance the state of uh risk in various categories of [[exponential tech]] but rather than just do a situational assessment the way some good [1487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1487.76s)

social journals the economist foreign affairs whatever might do it we'll be applying the consilience epistemics which is how do we look at it from all of the various narrative views that are out there if there's a views from the left and from the right views from different countries how do we factor those how do [1505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1505.679s)

we factor different epistemologies is there a lens that looking at it through is there a perspective we're looking at it through the lens of finance or culture or tech or whatever gives different insights how do we factor those together to have a higher order kind of insight and then specifically can we apply the [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1522.48s)

social theory we're looking at about what are the underlying basis of the problems in the world at large and what it would take to solve them so when we're looking at a you know u.s china issue we apply some of the theory of how previous civilizations decayed right generalized principles of civilizational and institutional decay [1544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1544.0s)

of game theoretic [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] of those types of things so that the theory grounds itself in showing this is actually what's playing out in the world in all these areas and then people can see what's going on in the areas of the world in a way that gives insights into what it would take to actually solve them so that's the situational assessments [1563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1563.679s)

and then the last category is if we do a situational assessment on a piece where there is an existing very strongly polarized set of beliefs about it like [[climate change]] or like coveted viral origins or like um the nature and reality of institutional racism in the west or something like that if we put a situational assessment out it will just seem like another opinion of lots of opinions that some people will agree with because it seems similar enough and some won't we actually have to address why is there so much polarization specifically which vested interests were pushing narratives in specific directions how did they do that [1602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1602.4s)

which epistemic biases or mistakes which way that things like the big tech platforms optimizing for tribalism and group bias ended up leading to it so we do this kind of complicated analysis where we're able to show here's the various narratives about this issue and here's forensically how they came about and we show things like principles of [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1624.799s)

[[narrative warfare]] here's where they took statistics that are true and they made it through a fact checker but they cherry picked the statistics and they didn't include statistics on the other side they decontextualized the facts they framed it in a particular way this other side did that as well here's where it's related to either their just [1640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1640.96s)

general bias or their actual vested interest and so what we're trying to do in that is help people be able to understand how the polarization type dynamics arise and how people get over certain about very partial truths and specifically how some of the both intentional and unintentional [[narrative warfare]] happen so they start developing a memetic immune system to [[narrative warfare]] and not being on the left thinking that the right snooze is bad or being on the right thing the less news is bad but recognizing that to get power in the narrative landscape at all you're playing the game of power so how do they actually notice statistical cherry picking and [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1679.84s)

decontextualization of facts and you know those types of things everywhere and develop better epidemic capacities make sense of the world so we're hopi hoping there to be able to give people the capacity to transcend tribalism no matter what tribe and have real epistemics and real good faith dialogue capacities to do something beyond tribalism it'd be pretty damn amazing if you could actually make make it work now we did a great job of describing conceptually uh the the three categories i think would be very helpful to give an example or two or just one example from each category [1717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1717.039s)

uh so that people can hang a hook on it so you know let's say here's a foundations piece here's one so if you do that for me i think that will help bring it home for the audience well at the date of us recording this i'll speak to ones that are on the site now the site just went up like in the last week as a super super early beta so i [1736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1736.08s)

ask people when they look at it to recognize that it's really just in the prototyping phase so one of the foundations pieces is called democracy in the [[epistemic commons]] and a lot of people might not know what epistemic or commons means or especially the two put together but epidemic how do we come [1756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1756.08s)

it's it's deeper than saying the knowledge commons because it's not just what is the body of knowledge that is agreed on as true by some process where we haven't questioned how do we agree that it's true the epistemic comments of how do we come to the process of belief about what is true and [1771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1771.76s)

shared understanding and like that so it includes the dialogue process the trust basis for institutions the uh ability of citizens to be able to uh actually check the process of thinking so the [[epistemic commons]] idea in that article is really so obvious and yet almost nobody if you aren't say [1798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1798.88s)

a political philosopher paying attention to this thinks about it a lot is if you're going to have a democracy or a republic if you're going to have a supposedly [[participatory governance]] how could you possibly have it if the people can't make sense of the issues that the government is governing on well you easily can if you just have a polyp bureau or you [1822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1822.64s)

just have a king or somebody making the decisions they're the only one that has to understand it and they do accurately or not and this is why when you said the founding fathers got right that both education and the [[fourth estate]] were prerequisite institutions for something like a democracy or republic to function an [[open society]] to function they're prerequisite institutions which is and that's why you know all those quotes about um i think it was a jefferson quote saying if i could have a perfect government and broken news or perfect news and a broken government i'd pick perfect news because if we have perfect news and [1856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1856.48s)

people fully understand the world they can build a new system of government if we have broken news and people don't understand the world there's no there's nothing other than to argue over nonsense and be captured this is why george washington had the statement that i'm paraphrasing but that the number one aim of the federal government should be [1873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1873.76s)

the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government i think that's so  profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule of law he didn't even say it's to protect the borders because a military dictatorship can protect the borders very well [1890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1890.48s)

and a police state can institute rule of law but if you emphasize anything other than the comprehensive education of the citizens it won't stay being a democracy for very long and that's the thing they were really trying to pay attention to and we can see the erosion of the quality of education and the [1907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1907.84s)

quality of the [[fourth estate]] relative to the complexity of the problems and say well it couldn't even possibly be that thing so what does the future of an [[open society]] look like what does it have to look like in terms of the shared values of the people that they would invest in in education [1924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1924.88s)

and have the civic virtue to invest in their role in governance because if we don't participate in our own self-governance we are de facto consenting to be ruled and so democracy in the [[epistemic commons]] is helping to explain those ideas you either are consenting de facto to a world that will move towards [1942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1942.88s)

autocracy or you have to be taking responsibility for adequate self-governance which requires [[sensemaking]] the issues before you could possibly make good choices on them and so it's helping to take that concept and make it clear where everyone can be like oh yeah i haven't even been paying attention to the foundational thing that is needed [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1962.08s)

and so that's an example now then there's another piece the next one uh the challenges to 21st century [[sensemaking]] shows why the [[epistemic commons]] is a much trickier thing today than it was in 1776 um the the complexity of the issues we have to pay attention to and the fragmented media landscape and [1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=1980.72s)

how powerful the media landscape is at being able to you know having an ad driven model it has incentives for appealing to bias and appealing to tribalism and salacious headlines and things that are short rather than long and nuanced and so we've had not just an erosion but like actually a increasingly pathological [[fourth estate]] um with an increasingly complex world so that piece is kind of giving an insight there so those are examples of like okay these are foundational concepts that we need to think about how the world has to be restructured there's situational assessments on there that are just different random but very important topics and [2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2026.399s)

there's one that's looking at the activity of china in east africa and the development of african infrastructure and like that that is framing up showing how the west has engaged with the developing world versus how china's engaging with the developing world we could have done china's activity in latin america or the [2044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2044.399s)

great game of power as expressed in the competition for 5g and telecom but east africa was as fine as starting point as any of them and very good and well researched piece that helps people understand the differences in the geopolitical approaches and kind of some of what is on the table [2064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2064.639s)

there the piece that goes into the difference between french secularism and u.s secularism seems like an obscure topic but why it's important is we've seen this topic of like the islam europe stress between certain versions of islam and certain versions of european [2083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2083.04s)

liberalism and with france specifically but in the us we're thinking about europe through a u.s central lens most of the time and so this goes through the history of the way that the us came to freedom of religion the way that certain european countries france in particular did and how fundamentally different they are and shows that we're actually [2103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2103.119s)

misunderstanding the nature of the issue and creating bad global policy or geopolitical policy based on um putting our cultural biases on and not understanding kind of cultural intelligence well enough those pieces were actually written before we had a lot of the theory pieces written [2120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2120.24s)

so they couldn't be instantiations of the social theory very well so they're really good articles but they're early prototypes we're building out the theory now and this was just to show we can actually execute not just talk theory which is important uh in the early phase of a project oh the one other one meta news we did [2141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2141.599s)

one meta news piece so far and we picked intentionally the easiest rather than the most consequential thing because this is ridiculously labor-intensive uh so rather than try to pick like a highly contested topic like vaccines or [[climate change]] that has an unbelievable amount of stuff to process on it we picked [2160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2160.72s)

uh the topic of during the george floyd protests were bricks planted at the protests to escalate uh the riots and violence because that was a topic where that was like the main news story for like two weeks and the right thought that the left antifa were planting the bricks the left [2180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2180.079s)

thought that the right was doing it there were accusations the police were doing it general media tried to say nobody's doing it and there are no agent provocateurs then there was conflation because we saw agent provocateurs but then there was an automatic jump to that means they must have also planted the bricks [2194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2194.32s)

so it was this highly contested thing and it actually everybody started to believe the thing or lots of groups start to believe the thing that aligned with their existing emotionally intensified perspective and so then they escalated as a result of believing the thing and there was actually not good [2209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2209.839s)

basis for most of the ideas on any of the sides and so but because it was a very constrained time period we were able to actually process every single news article ever written about it during that time period the couple thousands that there were so we used some machine learning [2224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2224.88s)

big data tools plus some uh analytic methods to be able to process it and be able to see how certain hashtags started to trend how certain things that looked organic weren't organic they were inorganic and being kind of virally doped and various things like that and it's a good case study of being able to show how you can take something like that because [2246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2246.0s)

then the world moved on and everyone still believes the thing they believed in they're just not paying attention to it it never actually got resolved and of course at the end we end up saying some of the questions are still unanswered and that's one of the things people have to come to is more comfort with uncertainty as opposed to wrong certainty that is more dangerous um so those are examples of some of the pieces there but over the next six months it'll really start to take much more clear shape yeah i think that last point is a really important one about the meta news which is if there seems to be any [2277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2277.839s)

disease of the current moment it's runaway [[confirmation bias]] right you find even the slightest thread of some story that uh that reinforces your uh model of the world and it's suddenly true right even though in this unbelievably deep dive you all get into the story of the bricks it's mad how uh how detailed this thing [2300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2300.4s)

is it comes you come away realizing that no person who actually takes uh knowledge seriously should have any firm view on this right because it's the evidence uh there is a lot of solid evidence once you get to the bottom what there is points in various directions and yet as you point out uh the uh various factions have all taken their own uh opinion and view about what this is because it reinforces their own narrative what a destructive dynamic that is in our society today well this is actually worth double clicking on a little bit you and [2334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2334.079s)

jordan hall and john verveicky have talked about the real versus simulated thinking issue and one of the things that's not hard to notice is if we put forward a specific idea whatever it is in the general media landscape and we know a little bit about the demographics [2354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2354.32s)

of a reader we can predict their responses better than we can predict the responses of the gpt3 algorithm most of the time which is really a sad measure of the general intelligence of are they really thinking or are they doing something more like memetic propagation which is does this seem to conform to my [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2370.079s)

existing memeplex if not reject if so accept and propagate and so you know we we can look at a piece and say like okay if someone is part of the q anon world view one of the very predictable types of responses is they will say that somebody on our team knows somebody who knows someone who is associated [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2394.72s)

with jeffrey epstein and therefore this is part of the propaganda of the deep state and whatever and there's like there's predictable trope lines they'll follow and if they're you know part of the far sjw oak movement they'll say if you're hosting a dialectic between the left and right you're giving platform to racists and therefore you're racist you should be [2414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2414.64s)

canceling them so we want to cancel you or and if they're part of and you can kind of you can predict those responses one of the things we want to ask is like if your response looks like a predictable response of a subgroup that you're adjacent to you should not feel good about that [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2430.64s)

right you should actually be like i think that means that i am thinking less originally than a narrow ai what do i actually think what does it mean to actually think have i do i understand all the arguments can i inhabit all the arguments well do is that is someone actually driving my innate predispositions towards [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2451.119s)

tribalism and uh excessive certainty and etc and so of course in order to do that well people have to have a certain amount of courage to be willing to be shamed by their in-group which is very scary right because if the in-group says if you don't agree with us we'll we will ostracize your de-platform you [2470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2470.4s)

there's a courage required for intellectual honesty even for intellectual curiosity and they have to have enough comfort with uncertainty to say this is really consequential it affects the world and i don't know and i'd rather say i don't know so that i have a chance of learning then be certain that i know [2487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2487.28s)

because it feels right uh feels right might mean just limbically hijacked me um and so then the thing that you know and i think probably most of your listeners are the type of people that know this has always been an issue right we can look at the history of religious war through this lens [2504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2504.8s)

um we can see people who are so certain of god's name that they would kill and die for gods that nobody believes in anymore and don't even know the names of um and or the rightness of their side of a war for patriotic reasons on both sides um or whatever it is yeah famously here in the civil war in the united states we're in virginia [2525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2525.599s)

where i live uh you know the hottest battles of the civil war were fought here and lots of the generals uh kind of mused on the topic that both sides were praying to the same god for victory and i i just finished uh reading uh shelby foote's uh 3 000 page uh civil war book and i knew a lot about civil war before now i know [2547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2547.92s)

more and it's amazing uh they were very self-aware of this and they realized that there was something very peculiar about this and to some degree it just emerges naturally there's almost a memetic evolution that the meme plexes that bind a group together [2562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2562.24s)

and keep it from cleaving and combine larger groups together and organize them in war just tend to win right there's like a natural selection for the ones that coordinate game theoretically well which doesn't necessarily mean that they are true or good yeah it's the daniel that's the daniel dennett argument for religion right that [2580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2580.88s)

it was adaptive at building group coherence uh over various scales from probably a few thousand up to uh you know some tens of millions and so therefore it was adaptive but it can be adaptive in the short term while [[self-terminating]] which evolution can do and that's the thing we we want people to understand is there [2598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2598.56s)

might have been cultures that would have been much better for long-term sustainability but they weren't good at militarizing because they'd figured peace out and they got slaughtered by warring cultures so what made it through we have to pay attention to but it doesn't necessarily mean it gets to keep making it through um so this but like it's not just that [2614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2614.8s)

it naturally emerged it's also that because it naturally emerged some very smart people figured that out and figured out how to dope and direct it right and so we can see the stories of great military generals figuring out how to how to pull on the emotions of the people or whatever it is and you can read the 36 stratagems to see [2634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2634.24s)

unconventional [[narrative warfare]] that is ancient right in the chinese world and other things like that but um but facebook and all of the modern information curation monopolies facebook youtube google et cetera have done something that is different in quantity like you were saying earlier to the extent that it's actually different [2657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2657.92s)

in kind um it's actually even different in kind fundamentally which is those platforms are not based on on centralized broadcast right in the way that our country was based on the idea that we could have a newspaper to be a some small group that could publish and [2676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2676.64s)

everybody else who could read that thing kind of one directionally and it went from that to a telegram to a radio station to a television that was basically better methods of broadcast but then the internet was not broadcast it was anybody could publish stuff it was decentralized many-to-many communication [2692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2692.8s)

but then there's so much stuff if there's a billion search results for anything how do you see which thing you get well the information curation platforms end up determining what you see and they are companies that have a fiscal they have a business model and their business model is based on ads so that you can get the thing for free [2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2710.4s)

so they can drive the adoption up to everybody without having a barrier of entry and so their ad model benefits from time on site optimization and people spend more time on site when they get limbicly hijacked because if their limbic system doesn't get hijacked they remember they don't want to spend much of their life on facebook they have [2728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2728.8s)

other to do but when they get their desire their addiction their fear their in-group identity their uncertainty pushed on they'll spin or or just [[hypernormal stimuli]] in general so one of the things is on the face facebook's algorithm it's ai algorithm that's curating the [2747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2747.28s)

news feed is paying attention to what my mouse spends the most time hovering over what i click on it's curating all the information on the on the internet or in my facebook universe to what will have me spend the most time on site and most of the time that which confirms my existing bias which makes me afraid of an out group [2765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2765.44s)

that i'm already likely to think of as now group and limbicly hijacks and outrages me will spend more time and so if there's something that is very nuanced and complex and thoughtful i'll just probably bounce because i'm in a hurry but if it has a salacious headline it's short and then there's another one like [2782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2782.0s)

it i'll probably spend more time so people became more polarized and more extreme without facebook even wanting to it wasn't some conspiracy that it wanted to drive that it drove all of the opinions further just by the fundamental nature of the business model in the architecture but at a level where there are more people on those platforms and there are [2799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2799.92s)

total people in china and the u.s combined there's ais that are better than the ais that beat gary kasparov chess affecting people's attention scape so it's like what does the [[epistemic commons]] what is freedom of speech what do all these issues look like in in this world because the founding fathers did not have to [2816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2816.56s)

deal with that kind of thing nobody ever had to so that's a it's a very big topic and so the meta news is hopefully one tiny little part trying to give people at least the awareness of how those tools work and give them a memetic immune system so that they're not hijacked quite as easily and there's more cognitive and emotional [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2834.48s)

sovereignty yep indeed and the regular listeners to the show know that my opinion as one of the founders of the online world i actually went to work building consumer online systems in 1980 believe it or not uh is that the pivot to the ad the pure ad model around 2006 when moore's law made networks and [2858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2858.319s)

computation cheap enough that you could actually support a quite functional product on ads only that's what ruined the internet god damn it uh i know i sound like a curmudgeonly old fart when i keep reporting that but daniel said it much more eloquently that essentially the fundamental dynamic is rather than making this [2877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2877.28s)

the service as useful and efficient for me the customer as possible if i were say paying ten dollars a month uh to facebook uh instead how how long can i keep uh uh daniel on and show him you know all these uh 16 pictures of stars look what they look like today right [2896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2896.72s)

and you know all this the you know the the and as you point out uh nobody has to even make these editorial judgments you just trickle them out there and as your behavior changes you optimize the algorithms and uh as it turns out uh and i'm sure zach had no idea uh it's the it's the worst information [2914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2914.64s)

uh not the good information that hijacks uh hijacks our our behavior and it's a real fundamental problem and now we actually go one step further okay that was bad enough that there was this emergent hijacking that points us to uh stuff that's not necessarily good for us now we have what might even be worse which is the big platforms making [2937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2937.68s)

arbitrary decisions about what is and is not inbounds for the from the public square uh and as an old-time internet guy i was always a uh you know free speech let the internet be what it's going to be but again this this scale quantity is really important you know when the internet was highly fragmented [2957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2957.76s)

i didn't care if somebody wanted to censor their blog that's their right they own the blog have it do whatever you want but when facebook has 2.2 billion people isn't effectively the public square for the world uh when they make start making decisions that this topic or that topic is out of bounds uh that's also [2974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2974.559s)

exceedingly dangerous and uh we're seeing a whole hell of a lot of that going on right now in fact both sides of our two polarized parties are doing various political politicized things to try to intimidate uh the platforms and that's not right either yeah i believe you've had tristan harris on your show before right [2996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=2996.4s)

twice yeah so if people haven't seen those and you want to know more about this go watch that also watch the documentary they put out called the social dilemma and uh i don't know if you've ever had gerund lanier or shoshan azubaf on they'd both be good people for this podcast yeah i've had a couple other people who are very [3013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3013.44s)

interested uh very interesting philip somebody other anyway yeah look on my list of people that we've had an ongoing series of uh the you know the social implications of technology on uh another thing i want to uh revisit like it's just so important yet it's almost impossible seemingly in our current environment [3031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3031.119s)

is this to read outside of your comfort zone uh again as uh listeners of the show know there's probably the topic i flame about the most is my distaste for organized religion and deep skepticism of all things metaphysical god damn it you know i say when i hear the word metaphysics i reach [3049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3049.119s)

for my pistol and that's a little overstatement a little over dramatic and of course we all have metaphysics even i've got metaphysics god damn it uh but point taken i'm not much on organized religion so but what magazine do i read most deciduously each month it's something called [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3067.92s)

first things it's a journal popular but really intense uh journal on uh of written by very religious very smart people philosophers from universities theologians etc and i read this thing uh every month and it's thick and dense because maybe i'm wrong right and so i like to give myself the exposure to the [3091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3091.76s)

very best minds i've been able to find i've subscribed this thing on and off for 30 years so i expose myself intentionally to the best arguments made by the people who my knee-jerk reaction is they're wrong now of course i also have the ulterior motive uh you want to know your enemies but [3110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3110.559s)

truthfully i approach it both ways and yet when you look at that i've seen this in online discourse you know you quote a good solid uh article let's say from the national review a conservative publication in a uh progressive venue online you get assaulted just for posting the link even if the [3130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3130.4s)

article is good right and vice versa you you know have an argument article from in nowadays even the new york times in a conservative venue and people go oh whether the whether the article is sound or not uh they have this tribal reaction to the sources and this is horrendous uh you know i can guarantee [3150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3150.079s)

you that because the problem was much easier but thomas jefferson uh read the partisan press that vilified him in the most unbelievable uh excoriating ways and uh but of course he also read the press that supported him and for us to have established this uh psycholimbic [3168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3168.48s)

system uh where we're afraid to even admit that we read the other side is whoa broken yeah and what you just said is a great way for democracy to die uh when there is so much enmity towards let's say in a national context here so much enmity towards your other fellow countrymen because you have no sense of fellow [3195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3195.68s)

countrymen you have no sense of a shared identity or shared patriotic unity or whatever that you're actually just taking each other as enmity enemies and infighting then any country that doesn't do that that has some unity even if the unity is imposed autocratically will just out coordinate and so if we look here at the specific example we can see that uh china is not a democracy when xi jinping came to power most of the government that had opposing ideas were taken out of position of government and that things like the sesame credit system are used to be able to [3237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3237.04s)

maintain uh non-defection uh and participation with a kind of um central control and you can see that that has resulted in the their ability to build high-speed rail all around the world and build a complicated belt and road initiative and uh bring 300 million people out of poverty in a short period of time [3261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3261.119s)

and pour more concrete for new infrastructure whatever the stat was in the last few years than has been poured by the us in forever and you know those types of things and you can see the us hasn't built a single high-speed rail since high-speed rail was possible even in our own country and you're like if there's that much differential and [3280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3280.0s)

coordination um where does that go and does that mean that the 21st century ends up being run by not just autocracy but [[exponential tech]] empowered autocracy which is something the world has only ever even thought about in sci-fi before it's never had to actually deal with and so you can see the us used to have more of a shared sense of uh national identity patriotism that also corresponded with real innovation through the manhattan project and the apollo project and maybe the apollo project was the last thing where the u.s actually did something really innovative as a national government um and i would say jim your generation is maybe the last generation that really had a sense as a whole generation of something like national unity and we can see that there's a number of steps that occurred we can see that you know the lack of faith that happened with nixon was a thing we can see the [3339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3339.04s)

counterculture movement was a thing we can see that obviously the internet and the fragmentation of everybody's perspectives was one of the major things before that i think the falling of the wall and the end of the ussr we didn't have a large enough external enemy to unify us anymore and so the us became the number [3356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3356.0s)

one and number two power so the left and right warring on each other was actually what the enemy hypothesis says we would do um but then what that means is if we have term limits so most of four years is spent campaigning to get an another four years and then whoever gets in just spends that four [3374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3374.24s)

years undoing whatever the previous one did you don't get high-speed trains that way you don't get anything that takes 30 years to plan in a term limit world where everyone wants to only initiate things that are going to create returns in that short time and when 90 of the energy just gets wasted as heat by the [3392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3392.319s)

by the two sides fighting with each other the internal fighting with each other that's a dying system right that's a system that's undergoing institutional decay in the process of dying and something else is going to take over so if we can't and this is one of the key insights is if i say you're totally dumb and stupid and despicable [3408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3408.4s)

and i want to not listen to you de-platform you how dare you even share that thing on our on our blog or whatever you don't stop existing because because i out group you you don't stop existing and you don't stop being a political actor and you don't stop paying attention to everything that i'm doing where even if i make a win i get a [3429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3429.04s)

near-term political win or a narrative win then your side is going to see what propaganda tools what ai tools what [[narrative warfare]] tools whatever did we use reverse engineer them make innovations and then act again so all you do by pursuing culture wars is drive cultural [[arms race|arms races]] and we're now because of [[exponential tech]] and the verticalizing part of what those [[arms race|arms races]] of all kinds do [[arms race|arms races]] with cannons were slow with bow and arrows were even slower [[arms race|arms races]] with ai weapons are fast enough it might kill everybody like we might just not be able to solve it and the same with dis info campaigns and being able to say well it's okay to spin the truth because our side is so [3471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3471.68s)

critical we have to get everybody to believe in [[climate change]] or everybody to believe against it or whatever it is that rationalization is actually breaking the world's capacity to understand anything well enough to possibly coordinate and so either we get over that and say i actually really need to know what other people [3489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3489.92s)

think because if we don't coordinate together we can't keep running warfare whether it's narrative war infowar economic war diplomatic war or kinetochore we can't keep running warfare with [[exponential tech]] where either we're causing exponential direct destruction or exponential indirect destruction [3506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3506.64s)

through externality so either we figure out how to coordinate or the the thing is not going to keep going a very interesting paper i'd love to point out here uh because this is not the first time we felt like a country that's tearing itself apart uh it's useful to remember 1968 was a mighty ugly year you [3523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3523.52s)

know cities were burned worse than they were last summer uh bombs were going off every day from the uh you know the weather underground and their radical left allies uh you know the clan was a real thing not just a few you know dumb ass right and uh you know the vietnam war you know it [3545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3545.04s)

was crazy and yet that was right in the middle of us putting a man on the moon uh and also uh while people took their politics seriously they didn't demonize people on the other side they just disagreed with them an article recently published in science it's very big survey high-end very good statistical analysis indicates [3567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3567.92s)

that weirdly in the united states today more people would disapprove of their child marrying a person of the opposite political party uh than would discriminate on either race or religion uh you know we've been fighting over race or religion probably for at least 10 000 years [3586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3586.319s)

and uh now the the political parties which we used to say there wasn't a dime where the difference between them is now a matter of life or death quite literally on who we want our children to marry and uh so that's really i think absolutely unprecedented in american history yeah and and it's existential for like [3607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3607.44s)

that if if that trend continues and doesn't get rectified then that is uh the if not the end of the us it's the end of the us having the possibility of playing a major role in positively shaping the um direction of the world or the end of and i'm not i'm not saying that everything the us [3628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3628.319s)

has done has positively shaped the world that would be naive and silly but the idea of the [[open society|open societies]] are at least a step in the right direction this is why we come back to education and the [[fourth estate]] and this is where the founding fathers said freedom of religion yes we don't care which one it is but you have to be a religious people what they [3648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3648.319s)

what they meant was uh that there's a moral education in addition to the uh cognitive epidemic education that was considered necessary for the system of governance because the civic virtue has to actually be a thing like ultimately what we're talking about when we say governance is how do we make choices together how do [3666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3666.559s)

we coordinate our choice making our choices are based on our [[sensemaking]] and our [[meaning making]] our [[sensemaking]] of what's going on why is it going on what would a specific strategy be that you know would have an effect what would the effect of it be right so both the assessment and the forecasting but the [[meaning making]] the values generation of what are we making choice in service to the ought side not just the inside it's the is and the ought together that inform the choice making which is the thing that we need to coordinate and really civilization is you've got all these choice-making beings but they affect each other with it how do you coordinate their choice [3701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3701.04s)

making in some way so that there's some type of cooperation possible um and so the only it's actually ridiculous proposition that a huge number of people who have totally different life experiences could cooperate or coordinate like it makes sense that a tribe could which is why [3722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3722.0s)

the dunbar limit was what it was then it makes sense that a king or some small aristocracy could rule a large group because the ruling group was small and they could all talk but the idea that some huge group can all come to coordinate together could only happen and this is all modern democracies we're following the enlightenment of modernity and the [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3740.96s)

idea that with the philosophy of science we can all make sense of the world together if we're trained in it and with the hegelian dialectic i can take your perspective you can take my perspective we can seek a synthesis there were things wrong with modernity post-modernism made some real critiques but those critiques need factored into a new thing that is constructive [3759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3759.2s)

is there a shared way to make sense of reality and to make sense of each other's perspectives not only uh deconstruction but reconstruction because if if as the we stop where post-modernism stops and says there is no real [[sensemaking]] that is separate from the game of power all that really is the game of power [3778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3778.0s)

then you don't get past rivalry and [[game theory]] you basically say that's the only thing [[open society]] only works if we can say there's actually a shared basis for coming to make sense of reality and pay attention to what everybody values and say how do we take what everybody values and take those as design considerations for better propositions yeah and uh yeah people listen to the show know my view on post-modernism which is that there is some useful critique there but i do not believe we should consider the way forward as through post-modernism we should consider it instead a little stub dead end that had some useful criticisms that we should absorb and that we should be trying to produce [3814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3814.24s)

an enlightenment 2.0 uh not going through post-modernism to whatever's on the other side of that because the other side of post-modernism is almost certainly a train wreck of train wreck or totalitarianism or both uh and so i think that's a really important point in which i disagree with [3831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3831.92s)

you know folk folks like hansi prynect etc uh who argues that we go through post-modernism to metamodernism i say no no no don't uh don't let post-modernism be foundational in what comes next rather consider it an interesting group of critics who may point out some important things that [3850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3850.16s)

were wrong with modernism or let's call it brought more broadly the enlightenment and let's improve the enlightenment and come out version 2.0 let's get a little bit away from our topic but i couldn't resist the rant i mean given that the the tagline for the consultants project is uh catalyzing a cultural renaissance it's [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3868.64s)

like it's exactly what it is right it's exactly on the topic and you know the meta-modern group and the integral group there there are a number of groups that have said what is post-post-modernism that is a that factors the post-modern critiques and says yeah it's true there were a bunch of messed up [3884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3884.48s)

victorian ideas that were creating bias and influencing and just straight-up power structures that were influencing the way we did social science so um there was like phrenology and bad dumb early social science it was reifying why the white race was better and why we were domesticating the savages [3903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3903.28s)

and it's like okay that that was nonsense that was not science but that doesn't throw out the attempt at science it means you correct it you say okay so bias influences finances influence et cetera so how could we bias correct let's never say we're unbiased because that just means [3921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3921.599s)

that we it's hiding in our blind spot let's say how do we seek what the biases are how do we factor all of the perspectives realizing they all have some signal so how do we error correct all the perspectives and then synthesize the post error corrected ones and that would be kind of the new thing we're seeking to develop together [3939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3939.119s)

absolutely and uh you know i often am amazed at how much sort of hot anti-science there is running around on both the right and the left these days uh and i'm the first to admit yep as you say science is not perfect by any means it's a human activity and i'd like to dig into both the philosophy of science and even [3958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3958.96s)

more interestingly the sociology of science uh and like any human activity it has its weird quirks you know people have status that probably shouldn't uh because of things like tenure where science unlike business uh the leading lights turn over more slowly at least in a formal power sense the way [3978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3978.16s)

grants are done grant making is done is uh you know obviously skews the field of science but if science is actually practiced honestly under the philosophy of science then yes it's not perfect and yes it will make mistakes but it's the only system we have ever developed that can provide inter-subjective [3998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=3998.16s)

verification of reality at some ever-increasing level of precision and to throw this out in information nihilism of the postmodern sort strikes me as literally insane uh okay so i actually want to add something to what you said that might appeal to the people who have deep science criticism and be able to synthesize these a bit so i'm not going to get into this here but probably most of the listeners know that the philosophy of science and the practice of science and then the public communication of science are three very different steps um the public communication has all kinds of incentives of being having political agendas [4042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4042.559s)

that are associated where a politician needs to look like they're doing something and has media companies that need to get ratings and much faster time scales than science can actually happen on the practice of science has uh the egos and the 10 tenures and the funding problems that it has the philosophy of science is much purer [4063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4063.28s)

than those other things and even the philosophy of science though is not an adequate epistemology it's a necessary but not sufficient epistemology because science is looking at the things that we can measure and do repetition on measurement on so the repeatable measurable stuff which is critical but it's not everything it's [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4081.839s)

the this is the classic is odd distinction it can give us is can't give us ought but then the applied side of science is technology and engineering and then the question is well how do we why do we use it what is a good choice if the study of the is gives us so much more causal power to make more powerful choices well if science says every ethical system is equally gibberish because there is no way to reify them in the philosophy of science then the only thing that ends up being able to be considered a good choice is theoretically the choice that doesn't lose in the presence of rivalrous choices which is why the best scientists gave of [4118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4118.56s)

the time gave rise to [[game theory]] and so then what you end up having is [[rivalrous dynamics]] multiplied by [[exponential tech]] which is one of the things we would say is the [[generator function]] of [[existential risk]] writ large so we have to get to a basis for choice making other than [[game theory]] which is why [[game b]] is called [[game b]] there's a change in the [[game theory]] that actually has to happen as opposed to just use more powerful tech to win and externalize whatever harm you need to in the process and so there is some ethical considerations that have to be part of the [[sensemaking]] or the epistemology as well so one way i talk about this um and ken [4156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4156.08s)

wilbur and many people have talked about this way it's not original is all the things that looked like enlightenments where wider populations than just a priestly class or just a nobility got some increase in knowledge capacity historically and this was these were not only western this was not just the greek and roman period and the you know [4175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4175.279s)

european period there was a uh confucian taoist chinese enlightenment there's a hindu enlightenment you know uh there was islamic enlightenment that all of them you can find first person second person and third person epistemologies arising together third person epistemology is what we can call the philosophy of science right how [4196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4196.64s)

do we make sense of the objective third person world we're gonna measure it do uh repetitions on our process experimentation etc the second person side though is our ability to know what each other think and feel which is critical to the human domain and that's where the hegelian dialectic or the socratic [4216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4216.32s)

method in the previous one like those came in is can can i argue your side as well as you can where you have nothing to add and rather than do it just as a rhetorical process can i actually inhabit your perspective to get what the world feels like from your perspective and get how you think about things [4233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4233.76s)

that's kind of second person epistemology and the first person is can i come to understand my own self which means my own cognitive biases my own desire for excessive certainty my own desire to not admit that i was wrong about previous so it is messing up my [[sensemaking]] or whatever it is and this is where in the greek tradition the stoic tradition would have done that which had a resurgence in the european enlightenment obviously the eastern traditions had a version of that but there's a first-person [[sensemaking]] for me as the sense maker that i have to pay attention to that is affecting everything so i would say a necessary [[cultural enlightenment]] has to include first-person second person and third-person epistemologies together very nice i like that a lot uh we're kind of getting a little tight on time here so let's move on to some of the other topics we wanted to talk about now this is a very ambitious very interesting very rich project this [4286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4286.88s)

consilience project uh you've said before at least in its initial phases it's not for everybody who is it for who are your target audiences yeah obviously the target audience if we were really talking about an open something like an [[open society]] um that where the order that a society needs is [4312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4312.96s)

emerging from the people rather than being imposed on them uh it the target audience has to be eventually everybody and yet we obviously can't speak the same way to everybody to begin with so a starting point is simply a starting point what we're working on here is both being able to analyze where existing problem-solving [4337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4337.36s)

processes are adequate to some of the problemscape and where they're not and where they're not what new problem-solving innovations new [[social system|social systems]] could be that could uh be commensurate with the things that have worked in the past and add new capacities so they're deep pieces they're thinking [4358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4358.96s)

pieces they do not require being a specialist right we're trying to write them in a way where let's say a piece takes 30 minutes to read any generally educated adult that really gives a could read them but they're not super easy reads um you you have to give give a you might have to look up a word or two here there [4379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4379.84s)

we try to make it where we aren't using unfamiliar language and terms where you'd have to be a specialist that aren't necessary the only times where we're using a term that is unfamiliar is where we think that term is so important in the english language as an intellectual tool for a concept that needs to be more popular that we're willing to engage the cost of using those words and having people have to look them up because the popularization of those words and concepts would itself be a type of success it would mean that more people were thinking with better thinking tools um so anyone who is willing to spend a little time and really cares and [4413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4413.76s)

uh gives a could be part of the audience the people who are already really thinking about the many [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] the world faces and recognizing that whether it's the unsdg approach or it's the silicon valley techno-optimist approach it doesn't seem like any of them are adequate or trying to think about how to [4431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4431.84s)

think about this better those would be people who are already primed to be interested and engaged but we're already working on making the first animations and who knows if this will be how it happens but like make one of these papers a 15 minute animation that a high school student could really engage in um and then you know a podcast where [4450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4450.08s)

it's our goal that this project has a lot of really brilliant people that were involved in and and caring people that were involved in um founding it directing it developing all the all the content that uh different people in this project and network can go speak on podcasts about papers where then if someone wants to hear it [4474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4474.239s)

kind of discussed in a long form podcast they can so we're gonna do the transmedia translation but the people for who and the reason we start with the higher brow articles is i can take a high resolution photo and make a low resolution photo out of it but easier than i can go the other direction [4491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4491.84s)

so we're trying to do the clear thinking first and then be able to make it more widely available and specifically those people who've already invested enough in the depth of [[sensemaking]] and caring about how to change our [[social system|social systems]] are the people that we're actually seeking to partner with that might be [4508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4508.239s)

able to help in the movement building that we're doing they're probably already working on projects or maybe or be interested in working on projects in the space um and then one of the other things that will happen is people there will be some people who understand some of what we're doing and [4522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4522.0s)

translate it to audiences in a way we never could right so we already had someone contact us who's building a rap battle platform and where the rappers are rapping about police violence or race issues or whatever they're like well if you're developing better content on some of those topics it's more nuanced and they could come [4540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4540.719s)

learn this and bring it to those communities and they would know how to do that infinitely better than we would or similarly someone who's a deeper thinker than most of their following on tiktok but would understand it well enough and bring it to the gen z tiktok audience that they have in a particular way [4557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4557.6s)

and that's why we say catalyzing a kind of decentralized cultural renaissance and this is also why our project self-terminates after five years is um for for something to really be an enlightenment or a movement it has to be the zeitgeist of the time and we would say we see this already happening right [[game b]] is another expression of this as you mentioned meta-modern and integral are things that are sniffing in a similar direction at least kind of sniffing and tristan and center for humane technology and those folks pointing out what's wrong with [[social media]] and how could we fix it is a part of that people that are focused on how do we improve the future [4593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4593.28s)

of education or how do we improve journalism so what we'd say is we see that there is kind of there there's a recognition that the there is an upgrade in culture necessary to be able to address the problems the world faces but most people don't think of it that way they're thinking of it just as journalism or education or the part of [4612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4612.88s)

it they're focused on so there's already a movement starting it's just nascent and it doesn't even recognize itself and the parts don't recognize themselves we want to help frame it where they all recognize you're right we are working on a [[cultural enlightenment]] for new [[social system|social systems]] adequate to the problems and we want to be able to help up [4627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4627.76s)

regulate signal upregulate the groups that are doing good work so that when this project shuts down in five years there's lot the aims that it seeks to serve are continuing in fully decentralized uninfluenceable and capturable ways uh you also have mentioned and we've chatted in the past uh [4647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4647.679s)

that you see uh one of the one of the more important aspects of the consilience project is being a good example to others particularly in the media on what is possible could you talk about that a little bit so yeah if we if we look at like the meta news so consensus project's a non-profit [4667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4667.36s)

project it's not just non-profit but it commits to not have any of the revenue streams that mess up media projects so it won't put any of the information behind a paywall it won't sell anybody's data it won't put ads on the site so it's it is donation funded and if we and we also won't accept any donations [4684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4684.96s)

that have any strings attached if someone says we'll donate but you know only speak favorably of our organization or whatever we'll tell them to off so um so we can only do as much as we can actually raise capital that gives us no [[perverse incentive]] um that was the cleanest way we could [4702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4702.719s)

build it we also don't have uh individual author titles or bylines on the papers because it's really a whole team effort that is building them and then people have to address the papers just based on the content not ad hominem on the authors and it makes it safer for the authors to say what the evidence really shows rather than what [4723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4723.679s)

will not get attacked it also decreases [[perverse incentive]] for even the authors inside of the organization to not pay more attention to the ones that have their name as lead author than the ones that they're supporting on so uh you know how do we do [[collective intelligence]] well is the question for the future of the world we're trying to [4742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4742.8s)

prototype it um here the completes after five years there will be some function that has to happen after that that is archival and maybe they can comment on if future people say well the consensus project was trying to say such and such they can comment on that so there may be some um very minimal vestigial thing that is [4764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4764.08s)

just doing that kind of archival function but the reason that we decided to shut it down is because most organizations end up having an incentive to keep being an organization and if they're trying to solve a problem that's actually a [[perverse incentive]] to never really solve the problem that would obsolete their existence where [4784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4784.48s)

their existence has given them some procedure power or something like that so then they manage the problem forever and we really wanted to show like no we're not seeking to be part of a long-term power landscape and we can't what we're trying to affect is way longer than five years so we'll only succeed if we help lots of other groups do better work than they're currently doing and we're going to do a public post-mortem when we're over so now the other groups know that we aren't in competition with them we want to help them do better we actually have to for our public postmortem to not look like we we failed um so we're trying to see how [4817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4817.36s)

do we create all of the incentives to be as aligned with the goal of the commons as it could be uh it's very interesting and uh you also have talked you've mentioned a couple times in passing the idea of community building uh around the consilions project and around the editorial work that you're [4835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4835.679s)

doing uh what's your thinking so far and i realize it's obviously very early and it's not what you're doing right today but uh you know a lot of people listen to the show are interested in uh social change through organizing and would love to hear your thoughts on uh what a movement around the [4851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4851.12s)

consilience project might look like yes and i realized i actually didn't answer your last question that was all the build up and then i forgot where it was now so i'll answer that one first you were asking what where are we prototyping media and how do you see yourself as an influence on media good influence on media that they can emulate [4868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4868.32s)

so in order to do good news there's some kind of intelligence function something like the economist has an intelligence unit usually their capacities are their proprietary knowledge because they're a company um that is providing that product or service uh for us it's the opposite we're really trying to enrich the [[epistemic commons]] as a whole we're a non-profit so any capacities that we're developing we're going to be not just taking the output of that capacity as media and putting it out there we're actually going to be writing how our capacity works as a prototype and having it be available for anyone else to utilize so like with regard to meta news we've [4905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4905.84s)

already started to publish on the methods by which we do meta news and our hope is that existing media orgs and new media orgs take that innovate on and run with it because we're way too small to be able to do all that needs to be done there we hope that that's an inspiration that the methods are an inspiration for people to do [4921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4921.84s)

better work um similarly as we kind of show what the consilience epistemics are how do we take many different perspectives and steal man the partial truths do analysis on them synthesize them that that inspires everything from existing media institutions to new ones to bloggers to uh yeah like that i think [4944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4944.88s)

sometimes you can't wait for demand to push supply because as you mentioned supply is so asymmetric that it's manufacturing shitty demand and uh so right now like the media organizations really do find that if they give more salacious headlines people click on it more and if it's short people will read it and if it's [4966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4966.88s)

long or it doesn't have a salacious headline people won't click on it and read it so the demand is perverse and so then the supply keeps appealing to and doubling down on the perverseness of it so who is our audience well our audience is going to be people who don't need salacious headlines also and are willing to read long nuanced [4982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=4982.719s)

things that are outside of their existing perspective and won't confirm their bias that's obviously a somewhat smaller audience but a meaningful one to start with um and our hope is that we can show people both how not good the news that they already think is good is and the media that they're consuming [5002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5002.48s)

and show them what is possible that starts to change the nature of demand so that existing sources of supply can actually start to have a race to the top rather than the [[race to the bottom]] that's obviously an ambitious hope but that's the hope uh why don't we hop back to my previous question uh daniel on community building that's [5021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5021.6s)

something you have mentioned a few times in passing here and you and i have talked about more than once so how do you see the opportunity to pivot from the consilience project and add a community building effort to that yeah we're starting with publishing and we will we would already be doing more in movement building if we had the bandwidth it's really a personnel bandwidth thing which is a resource bandwidth thing so that's what we're working on now and so we'll do as much as we can one of the things we're starting to work on in movement building is identifying all the groups that we think are doing [5060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5060.0s)

really critical work towards helping the [[epistemic commons]] towards helping [[sensemaking]] [[meaning making]] choice making capacities and being able to curate those resources and help to help give them the information we're working on that they might be able to better their own projects with and maybe help direct [5081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5081.36s)

attention capital other things that are needed to those projects and also re-contextualize so it doesn't look like a [[social media]] project here and a journalism project here and a education project here but that those recognize a relationship they have with each other as part of upgrading culture writ large so that's kind of like the first part we want to create forums where people can start to have deep discussions on these things and where we innovate with the digital architectures that rather than leading to kind of degenerate troll wars um lead to incentives on better quality [5119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5119.04s)

sense-making and better quality good faith discourse um those are just you know those are all things that take some work and take some bandwidth to do i really look forward to seeing this thing evolve this is a wonderful project uh those people are interested in it check it out at consilienceproject.org as always the link will be on the [5140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBU06Wswc7c&t=5140.0s)
