the philosophy of science looks at the domain of the measurable and repeatable or we can say the domain of measurable repeatable specifically which is always going to be third person and so there are some philosophical assumptions about what third person means what first person means and what the relationship between first and third person are [19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=19.76s)

or refining what we mean by subjective what we mean by objective and what the relationship between subjective and objective are that forest work starts at that level and the reification gives the basis to then be able to uh ground the philosophy of science in something deeper than it like obviously if we're looking at the domain [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=39.92s)

of measurable and repeatable we we have to start with measurable and the measurement always involves a measurer measuring some measured there's a triplicate relationship between the observed the process of observation and the observer and yet then what we try to do is take for the most part [57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=57.84s)

the measurement process and especially the measure for granted and create an ontology of measures even though the fundamental basis of the concept of measurement itself isn't even semantically frameable in a logical way without those three concepts being bound so it's very interesting if you look at [80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=80.24s)

kind of vedantic idealism or buddhist idealism or solipsism in general on one side you look at physicalism on the other side i would say that they make the exact same reductive mistake so physicalism says that objective or physical is fundamentally real and subjective is either not real like it's just an illusion a la you know [105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=105.2s)

radical eliminativism or it's an epiphenomena it's a you know secondary and they have a very compelling argument for that right the compelling argument is it requires assuming a bunch of things as more epistemically grounded than i think they are but so big bang just a bunch of [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=128.479s)

plasma and then particles and whatever it doesn't seem like there's anything we can call consciousness in there eventually planets at a certain point hydrological biological process protocells whatever it's very hard to think about consciousness before that so it seems like there was physical stuff before there was consciousness stuff so then [149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=149.12s)

consciousness must have emerged out of there and if people can describe their [[subjective experience]] well hooked up to an eeg or an fmri and we can look at their brain and we can see some type of statistical correlation between patterns of brain and their [[subjective experience]] then we can say there's a correlation between subjective and objective but we think that the [166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=166.879s)

objective is controlled by the objective i.e that physics is causally closed therefore your brain state this moment is the result of your brain state a moment ago and the particle physics that governs you know ion differentials of what's going to actually happen in the brain in relationship with the body and the environment so if [188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=188.879s)

there is a one-for-one correlation between described subjective states and observed objective states and the objective states are the result of scientific causation and this closure over that then subjectivity must be a a causal epiphenomenon right like there's various versions of that argument and as you can see you know argument between sam harris and dem dan dennett who both would typically think of themselves as being mostly informed by the philosophy of science come to you know dan dennett says that consciousness is not real but free will is and sam says free will is not real but consciousness [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=228.08s)

is and um at the end of their argument sam said something like it appears we have fundamentally different intuitions on this which is actually very important which meant that the symbol grounding was actually the the key thing and this is where you get tarsky's theorem you know coming out of girdle's theorem which is that any [246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=246.08s)

formal logical system involves ideas that cannot be reified in that system and that means that there is no logical system that is consistent that's also complete and i now this comes back to why i said there is no perfect [[social system]] and it comes back to why the first thing lao tzu said when he wrote his book is that the dao that is [265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=265.68s)

nameable is not the eternal dao is the formal system that is complete is doesn't exist right okay so we can see how basically philosophy of science is and obviously i'm radically oversimplifying to go quickly and we can do the nuance thing at some point so the question what is real philosophy of science says well the stuff that is [291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=291.04s)

measurable and repeatable seems to be pretty clearly real because we might think that sound is faster than light but we can all measure that it's not and it's the same every time and so the the congruency of objectivity and the repeatability of it and its independence to our beliefs about it seems like a good [308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=308.72s)

basis for real and then the fact that we can make predictions with it and make out of it and it works and whatever and so then of course you have an epistemology which is measuring and repeating and then testing and you know like that which is you have an epistemology of third person that is the epistemology that makes [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=327.12s)

sense starting with the ontologic assumption that what is real is the stuff that you can assess via that epistemology and so then you do a bunch of third-person assessment and all you find is causation in third person and so of course you end up then coming to what is real is third person stuff because your whole process has been [343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=343.84s)

measurements on third person stuff so there's an ontological assumption that creates an inappropriate epistemology that then proves the ontological assumption so then vedontor buddhism did the exact same thing on the opposite side they say that subjectivity is fundamental and objectivity is either an illusion or maya you know et cetera or an epiphenomena the structures arising within consciousness and they argue it in a very similar kind of way on the opposite they say well i don't really i can't prove that i'm not dreaming or in a hallucination or anything else so my measurements might all be part of a dream [379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=379.759s)

and you and the repeatability of it is all part of my dream so i have less epistemic ground on the objective stuff out here than i have on the basis that there is an experience arising that i'm actually experiencing something descartes said something obviously very similar to this and so what i have the most epistemic grounding [396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=396.319s)

on is that experience is occurring but my perception of myself as experience or might be an illusion there is a self here but it might be different than i think it is and there's a world but it might be different than i think it is so there is some self experiencing a world experience or [413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=413.36s)

experiencing an experience but then the experienced and the experiencer might have delusion but the experience is prima facie occurring so what i can what is real is that which can be experienced as opposed to measured and repeated therefore i have an epistemology of inquiry and noticing the nature of experience and running experiments in [436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=436.56s)

there of moving attention in certain ways and seeing what happens with experience and so i get a phenomenological epistemology and then that ends up confirming see everything that i notice is experience and everything that is objective is a right i can only say even exists because i'm experiencing it if i couldn't actually [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=454.24s)

experience the measurement the measurement wouldn't have occurred this is the if the tree falls in the forest and there's no one there to hear it right so i would say that they both basically made an ontological assumption that then created an epistemology that then confirmed the ontological assumption and east is east and west is [471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=471.12s)

west and over the train shall meet and then of course silicon valley and whatever we do this very funny thing like take principles of buddhism to do a mindfulness practice to crush the competition more effectively which is a very funny strange hybrid of um kind of the game theoretic versions of both but underneath the experience so okay the vedantist will walk you through a process and say notice the tree now notice that you aren't the tree you're the one noticing the tree okay so notice some other objects notice that you aren't those objects you're the one noticing the objects now notice your thoughts those thoughts are objects [510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=510.479s)

objects of attention so notice that you you can hold an image of the tree in your mind so you aren't the thoughts you are the witness of the thoughts and you aren't the emotions the sensations because you're witnessing them on and on and so all of those are not ultimately what you are they're changing what is [529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=529.04s)

unchanging and all of them is the witness therefore you know the upanishads say again and again only the self is real only the witness is real right but they started with an observer observing and observed right i had to start with the tree i had to start with a bunch of objects to even point at the subject because the subject is not even definable outside of its [549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=549.36s)

relationship with an object whether the object is a perception or the perceived right and so i took for granted that i was only able to even notice subjectivity or consciousness or reference it by starting with subjective objective in the relationship between them which is the same thing as i start with [568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=568.399s)

in science taking a measurement and there is clearly a conscious experience of registering a measurement through a measurement process then i'm going to take for granted the conscious registering of that and the measurement process to make an ontology of the measured [586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=586.24s)

so there is a deeper process that says that to even define observation or experience or measurement well there it are these binding of the concepts that are necessary and sufficient and there's a triplicate kind of binding if we can define a formal philosophy there a formal metaphysics there [604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=604.399s)

then the the epistemology of the objective which will be a reified philosophy of science is now founded in something that also can give us a epistemology of the subjective and an epistemology of the relationship between the subjective and the objective and ethics actually lives in the [623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=623.04s)

relationship between the subjective and the objective which is why you have to factor objective measurement metrics utilitarianism and why that is necessary but not sufficient so forests work you know if somebody uh googles eminent metaphysics you'll see a pdf come up [642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=642.079s)

and then he has a few other writings on a website uvsm.com forests work so we know from from gurdle's theorem we know from tarsky's theorem that we cannot have a system that is both perfectly complete and perfectly congruent so one of the things that forrest ends up doing in the metaphysics is actually [663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=663.76s)

defining an upper bound on the knowable and in any domain where the upper bound on the noble is that's something called the incommensuration theorem and then being able to define what the appropriate epistemic process within the domain of the knowable is and then also how to do inner domain transfers across the epistemics of different systems and [682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQ7QbJGWRE&t=682.959s)

so basically as a metaphysics it is not complete but it defines the upper bound of what level of completeness could happen and then it it offers the upper bound of
