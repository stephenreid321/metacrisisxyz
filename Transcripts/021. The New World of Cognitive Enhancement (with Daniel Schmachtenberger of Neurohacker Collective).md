music applause what're nootropics generally means a chemical that increases some aspect of cognitive function maybe its focus or memory or creativity or something but increases some aspect of cognitive function beyond your normal healthy baseline without meaningful side-effects music human os learn master achieve cognitive [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=23.3s)

enhancement that is the subject of today's show the desire to boost our mental abilities is nothing new yet the field of nootropics and cognitive enhancers is really growing rapidly i heard a statistic on my friend josh trends podcast wellness force radio that this subject is now one of the top 10 fastest growing health trends in the world and it's not a surprise our world [56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=56.789s)

is filled with cognitive work we are no longer tilling fields or hunting and gathering we're in meeting rooms we're giving presentations we're typing code etc etc we are required to spend hours upon hours focusing and performing well mentally while the same time being bombarded with interruptions if you're dubious at all that society wants the [78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=78.9s)

semi equivalent of brain steroids go back and listen to my show with professor stephen hinshaw who is the vice chair of psychiatry at ucsf on the remarkable rise of off-label usage of stimulant smart drugs like ritalin and adderal now we have over-the-counter substances that are claiming to not only be able to enhance cognition but also be able to keep the brain healthy as we age [101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=101.79s)

oftentimes these cognitive enhancers are provided in what's called a stack which theoretically means several complementary compounds that are combined for synergistic effect today my guest is daniel martin berger who is the head of product at neural hacker collective an organization that is dedicated to optimizing cognition and human betterment in the show we [123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=123.06s)

discussed the product qualia although daniel and i are talking about ways we can work together since we have overlapping object and perspectives on how to make the world a better place i have no financial relationship with the company at the time of the recording but i do have a favorable opinion about the product i just want to let you know that i [139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=139.94s)

received no financial remuneration from you purchasing the product because of our discussion and with that i bring you my discussion with daniel daniels martin berger welcome to human os radio leiden be here thanks for having me to begin i'm interested to know more about you what were the conditions under which you developed your mind as a young person and how do you continue to do [160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=160.64s)

that even today fun question i think one of the key defining things for me was i was home-schooled throughout most of my childhood and the reason for it was my parents were educational philosophers theorists and they had the idea that if kids were given pretty much no curriculum but exposed to as many things as possible and then their interests [184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=184.459s)

were facilitated that they would kind of blossom in the unique way that they were most innately suited to and so it was an educational theory experiment and so i had no curriculum at all never did hand writing spelling state capitals and it happens to be those three are good examples of things that i never learned well spell-checking later taught me how to spell and make the fact that my [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=207.92s)

handwriting is illegible tolerable okay and don't have state capitals but i was fascinated by all of the sciences i'm fascinated by all the philosophic disciplines and so i got to start working in understanding modern physics as a little bitty kid and eastern and western schools of philosophy and etc and one of the other cool things was not having subject divisions i didn't know [230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=230.15s)

there were subject divisions so there was no arbitrary break between physics and chemistry or chemistry and biology or any of the disciplines so we'd be as a little kid it asked a question like why is the sky blue and part of that answer has to do with the physics of diffraction and the molecule size the upper atmosphere that means you have to understand sun and stars and solar [251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=251.959s)

formation and atmospheric chemistry and how diffraction works and the physics of light waves and the actual molecules in the other atmosphere but it also means you have to understand how a retina work and what's objective blue is and what is the difference between subjective blue and object of blue and then the hard problem of neuroscience and like all of that comes into her the answer that well [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=273.199s)

mm-hmm almost everything was a movement between various sciences and then getting into the deep philosophy the ground of the sciences or the hard problems were and that led to a interdisciplinary and system orientation to understanding the nature of reality that we live in and of course for me it was always implicitly because understanding early on evolutionary [295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=295.91s)

theory universe was going somewhere and it was organizing itself towards more orderly complexity and with that more complexity new [[emergent property|emergent properties]] with more evolved physiologies there were new capacities of consciousness and so it's clear that something like we have a role to serve in participating with that evolutionary impulse of universe as the one creature here that we know has the [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=323.419s)

abstraction capacity with our certain structures of prefrontal cortex to understand evolution itself right to not just be a part of the grand design but be able to think about the whole thing the direction of evolution of the principles of it do we really have the meaningful capacity to consciously participate with it and looked like the evolutionary impulse is evolving [346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=346.01s)

everything all of universe so my interest early was how do i understand universe how do i understand where it's going and how to help participate with evolution of everything so that also looked like activism in terms of how to actually support the evolution of quality of life for all sentient things yeah and one thing i'll add because it's so important for people to know is that [364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=364.82s)

for the most part of the kids ask questions that they're really interested in like why is the sky blue and we don't really understand the answer we don't facilitate the interests well and then we try to force them to be interested in or at least do  __  that they're really not interested in at all and the process of forcing them to do uninteresting things while not the facilitating [383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=383.99s)

interest is what breaks people's interest in life and then you have to extrinsic ly motivate them with money or reward or whatever and otherwise they want to chill and watch tv or play video games but if intrinsic fascination with life gets fed and silat ated than they are innately and ongoingly highly agentic by nature your background [402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=402.56s)

is particularly interesting to me we are seriously considering homeschooling our four-year-old boy hearing you explain your background is motivating to me and that this is indeed a good course to pursue i was a solid student growing up but i became a much better student later when i found myself in learning environments where i had more freedom to do things like for example spend long [424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=424.4s)

periods of time on a subject versus changing my focus every 50 minutes like you do at most schools so for me changing class that frequently was really disruptive i'm more of a type of a learner where i like to go deep i built momentum and then i want to stick with a subject for a while and then also whatever typically has my attention has all of it so i would do very well in [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=443.93s)

some classes and just okay and others also the more i advanced my own education i had the freedom to learn more about how i learned and if i knew some of these things earlier in life my ability to advance my own knowledge with the effort i was putting in i think would have been greatly accelerated so for my boy desmond i think about how to create this custom learning experience [464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=464.15s)

that adaptively contours to his interests a way to always harness that natural curiosity that we have as children and to empower that love of learning by all means necessary so it's really nice to hear about your experience and that you look back on it with appreciation i think about this technologic unemployment is going to in something like 30 percent of all jobs in [484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=484.34s)

the next 15 years mm-hmm it's going to start with a lot of labour jobs but it's going to move with a eye to a lot of non labor jobs when we think about the history of education if a kid was gonna grow up and take over the family business or the family work whatever that was so they had to kind of learn how to do those things from a skill location point [505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=505.07s)

of view or then it became more infrastructure alized and they were going to just get some job within infrastructure within my pre-cana me they had to be prepared for the workforce the workforce is gonna get progressively more and more automated by the time that people who are kids now will be moving into what we would have called the workforce previously mm-hmm [525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=525.14s)

and what will be unique is things that are uniquely human and so if there are things that robot can learn to do well in ai can learn to do well and obviously there's a deep question around strong ai but let's just take strong ai off announce the things that are uniquely human are going to be the only things that really adaptive for few minutes to do they also happen to be [543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=543.99s)

the things that are most fascinating and fun and intrinsically rewarding for humans to do so this has always been a relevant conversation yeah but it is living in a way that it never has been right so these are some big global issues that we are facing how it's all going to play out is you have to be told but what i'm hearing is that the need to be able to maximize some of our innate [563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=563.73s)

human capabilities is of paramount importance for the next generation and even for people that are going to go through this transition when you think about a cognitive enhancer which is ostensibly at the topic of today you think about something that might make you focus better remember more be able to task switch better but if you remove a layer from there and you think this is [583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=583.17s)

far more important for overall humanity it's for us to be able to figure out ways to optimize our minds ability to interact with this world and to be our very best on a consistent basis so what was the first experience that you had that motivated you to explore the space i've been interested in human potential development and what the space of possibility was and enhancement [608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=608.58s)

capabilities my whole life whether we're talking about meditation and psychotherapy personal development or physiology brain chemistry and so as far as chemistry goes an interest in natural medicine and healthcare biohacking neural hacking eeg neurofeedback these are just always kind of hobbies and insofar as the topics that i was really committed to for the world required [631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=631.62s)

high-level cognitive capacity continuously supporting that was an important topic i got more acutely involved when i actually was diagnosed with some kind of mysterious autoimmune diseases that were very rapid onset and it didn't have adequate cures in the allopathic or the holistic alternative worlds and it had a shitty prognosis and other physical pain disability kinds of [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=656.52s)

symptomology they also had decreased cognitive and would symptomology which was the center of abilities that didn't work you lose and so i knew that if i was going to be able to fix these issues that didn't have adequate solutions i was gonna have to figure it out and i knew that was going to take cognate bandwidth so my first focus [673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=673.889s)

strategically was used the bandwidth that i have is on increasing cognitive bandwidth then use that to figure out the underlying pathophysiology etc what's going on and corrected and then get back to work and so that led to a very deep dive in the whole topic of cognitive chemistry and this was rob's brain nutrients at robux understanding neurotransmission optimization etc so as [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=695.639s)

i was diving deep into that space and looking at what's been done well and we're there pretty significant polls one of the big holes that i'm always wanting to look at is the topic of synthesis where do we have a lot of knowledge of acetylcholine goal or dopamine role or glutamate role or neurotrophins role but not the complex relationship between those or even between different aspects [717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=717.329s)

of the regulatory system on any of them and so looking at how do we support many complex systems that are self-regulating to have increased regulatory capacity became the deep question for me so synthesis there that led to me doing work on myself where i was able to achieve increased cognitive bandwidth to beyond what my previous healthy baseline had been even while i had [740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=740.16s)

pathophysiology going on and then was able to figure out underlying cause what was going on for me corrective reverse autoimmune antibodies that whole fun thing that led to doing that with quite a few other people that had various forms of disease that didn't have adequate solution and clinical settings and to formalizing a model of how health aging illness and reversal of illness [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=761.579s)

could work there was a complex systems informed model for medicine and well-being and so that really was a lot of things that that would pertain to but the psycho neuropharmacology the cognitive psychological stuff was really essential because almost everyone who is dealing with complex illness has some brain fog cognitive effects and has some emotion affected by hearing that they've [784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=784.23s)

got incurable prognosis and they have to have their psyche and their cognition in the right place to do everything that it takes to get better right so focusing on that first became a central thing so i would say that's where i went from being a area of general interest to a area of central deep-dive mm-hmm yeah so what i'm hearing is there was a need that arose for you personally that [807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=807.29s)

fostered a deep dive to understand the overall system with which any possible solution would be working over your health aging etc from there then you wanted to understand not only how we might be able to utilize some sort of exogenous chemical to amplify a process but rather how can we help make the entire mind that is doing the thinking stronger and better over time it seemed [830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=830.56s)

like that was the goal yes and then you've been working to solve that yeah the last thing that you said i think is absolutely central to what our goal as an organization is is that when we think of psychopharmacology as a field or really just pharmacology as a field there are exceptions and they don't mean to over generalize but generally there is less focus on fundamental or [853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=853.04s)

causation and especially if it is multifactorial right like we focus on cause and we're usually quite good in western medicine if it's an acute cause right injury or acute infection or acute poisoning is quite obvious right and so then you reverse that acute cause but if the cause is time-delayed so it's hard to find out what it was or it's multifactorial there are multiple [873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=873.74s)

things that are involved independently or multiple sequence steps there's a causal cascade it's hard to actually understand what it is and so we'll cluster symptoms into disease names but if we look at what was the path of the deviation from homeostasis that led to this person's ms or cancer or rheumatism a hundred different mss have a hundred different paths of ideologies right and [898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=898.31s)

there are commonalities and then but this is why personalized medicine is so critical so generally given the understanding cause has been difficult the focus has largely not been on what's actually in balance and how do we correct it because it's not a small number of things right it's usually a large number of things right the focus has largely been is there some kind of [916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=916.67s)

exhaustion ischemic or treatment that we can give that will limit the symptom ology or some aspect of pathogenesis and we've that's better than not doing anything but we can take the next step in our science etc is good enough to take the next step into our focuses rather than give some exogenous external override to an internal regulatory system that is radically [938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=938.18s)

complex and intelligent and brilliant let's work to understand what's actually wrong with the regulatory systems or deficient in them and up regulate the regulatory capacity of the system so it's fundamentally more adaptive more resilient etc i've done research in the condition of narcolepsy for over 10 years now gosh maybe 15 and i have an example that's relevant to what we're [961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=961.19s)

talking about narcoleptics are missing a protein in their brain called hypocretin one result of that pathology is excessive daytime sleepiness which is what usually is synonymous with the word narcolepsy for most people but another symptom is called cataplexy which is the loss of muscle tone or partial paralysis when somebody experiences emotion usually so daniel you tell me a joke and [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=984.649s)

i experienced weakness in my limbs and in fact it might be where the term weak from laughter comes from narcoleptics also experience depression with greater frequency than the rest of the population so early on in the treatment of this condition narcoleptics were given a class of drugs called tricyclic antidepressants turns out that this medication also improves patient's [1003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1003.67s)

cataplexy which was totally serendipitous but the medication is not directly confronting the cause of narcolepsy but rather it is ameliorating one of the symptoms but only temporarily so here's the problem tricyclics do reduce cataplectic attacks in these patients but the medication loses its potency over time over the course of several months patient will build up [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1021.339s)

tolerance to the drug and they will take what's called the drug holiday to allow the receptors to resend ties to the medication and in this scenario however when a patient goes off of the drug they are essentially paralyzed for days at a time and where they're having up to 60 cataplectic attacks per day so they basically have to stay in bed until the [1040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1040.449s)

brain resented eise's and readjusts in some conditions that's the best we can do but it does highlight how when we try to exhaustively override as you say a system in the brain usually we only provide a short-term gain but there's always a long-term price to pay so let's take narcolepsy for instance what is the cause of narcolepsy well it probably has quite a few distinct causes many of [1062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1062.52s)

which can be happening or not in any particular situation right so can someone have sleep issues that are causing narcoleptic lights symptoms sure can they have sleep issues from structural pain somewhere in their body or from waking up in the night to urinate too much nocturia or from apnea or from head injury that caused firing pattern injuries or from [1085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1085.63s)

got brain access disorders or from toxicity or methylation disorders or there's so many underlying mechanisms that can lead into a particular set of symptom ology that in order to really be able to address it comprehensively our approaches identify everything that has statistical correlation that could be causal even if it's not one for one correlation because we're not looking at [1110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1110.38s)

one disease one cause we're looking at multifactorial possibilities and then be able to do differential diagnosis across the entire causal phase space all the things that could be involved to see which ones actually are and then look at treatment that is specific to pathways rather than to symptom ology or disease clusterings you're describing a very sophisticated approach to address a [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1133.09s)

problem and the body is sufficiently complex that if we really want to do better with our health in the modern world we need to be able to implement this degree of sophistication in diagnosis and treatment so i'd like to segway to using this sort of approach to support optimized cognitive enhancement let's start if you will by describing first what is a nootropic substance for [1157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1157.63s)

our audience and then tell us about your product qualia sure so quality is the first product that released market we have many other products in the nutraceutical category that are in various phases of r&d or testing and will be released soon for various different goals mostly in the upgrading mind brain interface space so looking at things like pain and sleep and anxiety [1182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1182.53s)

and etc quality is largely what people would think of as a cognitive enhancer but the focus that we have is not adequately summarizing the work cognitive so answering your first question what are men tropics no tropic is a kind of loosely defined term there's ambiguity of definition but a general means a chemical that increases some aspect of cognitive function maybe it's a focus or memory or creativity or something but increases some aspect of cognitive function beyond your normal healthy baseline without meaningful side effects so we're used to things that can increase cognitive function back to baseline if you had some kind of deficit cognitive decline or whatever and we're used to the idea of something that can be enhanced beyond baseline but with [1227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1227.95s)

meaningfully negative side effects like an pet amines that can increase focus so the idea of no trophic was can we understand some of the mechanisms that cognition operates through neural chemically and be able to support those in ways that don't create meaningful side effects or externalities the term was coined with the development of a chemical called piracetam that really [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1248.14s)

stirred out a whole new category of drug research rasa thames and then empathy and mostly they were a receptor site modulate this for certain neurotransmitters smart drugs is a related but slightly different word which generally means pharmaceuticals that have some cognitive enhancing potential these are usually either drugs for narcolepsy or for a td or for [1269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1269.62s)

certain kinds of depression or certain kinds of neurodegeneration sins and so we look at things like adderall modafinil wellbutrin deborah nell and these are things that can increase some aspect of cognitive baseline but oftentimes do have some meaningful consequences so the risk reward is a tricky thing to consider mm-hmm no topic is also encountered distinction to the [1295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1295.03s)

term brain nutrient which is just fundamental nutrients that we need dietarily that many people don't get enough upper optimum even though they're not in a tube deficiency there and kind of what we call subclinical deficiency mmm-hmm and so this is the right fatty acids the right amino acids minerals vitamins that support normal brain function those aren't gonna bring you [1315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1315.46s)

beyond baseline because the body's going to convert as many as it actually needs and then not more but they will keep you at optimum baseline or bring you back to it if there's deficit so the oli actually involves key brain nutrients that are actually needed for the way some of the nut tropic ingredients function there ders or transplant actors and that are [1334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1334.48s)

chronically at suboptimal levels and then include some things would be more in the no trophic category some of which are synthetic some of which are plant derived i have been exploring the space for about a year and a half and i have to say that my own personal experience with qualia has been very noticeable and very impressive we've not discussed this before so for the listener daniel is [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1355.48s)

hearing my feedback for the first time on air my experience with qualia has been different i would say then with other new topics i've tried first that let me discuss energy when i take it i feel a calm energy that lasts i don't experience a drop off like you get with caffeine i don't feel overstimulated either so that's really an ideal situation next my [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1376.0s)

focus is stronger with it i feel like i can take it dip in the afternoon though my energy doesn't necessarily flag so i still i think it's just a sign that my brain wants to take a break and go for a walk so i try to attend to that but it's still a different feeling than simply feeling exhausted by work my ability to tasks which is improved which is actually a huge impact on my [1397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1397.63s)

productivity because in today's world there's just a lot of task switching that we all need to do with email and notifications etc also i'm a happy-go-lucky guy but i even wake up an annoyingly good mood but i actually experience in mood elevation with qualia how did i notice well i caught myself saying hi to random strangers more on the street and generally just feeling [1417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1417.309s)

more outgoing and at first i was a little worried about this because things that can elevate mood also are subject to a reduced mood later but i didn't experience a dip and either the day of taking it or during the weekends when i don't take qualia and on that note you instruct people to take the weekend off from taking it which i do but again i didn't feel the dip and energy focused [1437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1437.559s)

mood which indicates to me that we've created really supports the health of the entire system versus trying to squeeze all the cognitive enhancement out of one pathway leaving you feeling depleted later and lastly i also noticed that i have really good sleep when i'm on qualia but even on the days where i don't get what i consider to be a adequate amount of time in bed so for me [1455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1455.169s)

that's about seven and a half hours i am leslie being more capable the next day when i take qualia then i am when i don't so there you go there's a live testimonial for you a couple things on that first two disclaimers on our side one is not a drug right and treat anything and it's not prescribed for any diagnosed things etc this is a supplement without fda [1477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1477.72s)

classification or any drug stuff second thing is that we are absolutely not recommending it as a way to deal with lack of sleep as far as general lifestyle optimization goes exercise matters food matters mindset matters being outdoors matters there's a lot of things that matter we probably put sleep in its own category and everything else in the second category in terms of just [1503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1503.13s)

how important it is for overall physiology or there and one of the things that we push heavily is to really support people getting enough and good quality sleep and that galia works radically better in well-rested people than in people that are dealing with some sleep deficit so just that public service announcement yep and i agree with that fully as a sleep researcher [1524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1524.46s)

there is nothing that's been identified that replaces the need for sleep what i would say is that i think i perform better but that does not encourage me in any way to then cheat sleep there is a exponential benefit to getting better sleep and then having quality in my system then getting not enough sleep on a regular basis if someone is getting insufficient amounts of sleep acutely [1546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1546.77s)

rarely then we're gonna deal with that much better than chronic sleep deficit yeah even if we're only talking about an hour less than the person actually needs but over a period of time i can really start to have profound effects so yeah moving on to the effects you experience i'm delayed because you said things that related to most of the goals we had in [1565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1565.29s)

the development of this particular product so one thing that we said was essential to our focus was how do we regulate regulatory capacity rather than up regulate particular state right mm-hmm in a way then creates external dependence and so we saw how many people were using adderall not even on prescription for appropriate purposes but off-label as a way to get through [1587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1587.88s)

midterms or finals or their tech startup or whatever and it's a dopamine agonist but it is one it's going to be flatlining your dopamine while you're on it as opposed to how your dopamine responsive your dopamine regulary system responsive to what's happening because we don't want the same dopamine levels all the time right or any neurotransmitter we want them to be [1606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1606.97s)

responsive so our state can shift to be appropriate to the environment mm-hmm - it's affecting dopamine without paying attention to its relationship in healthy cognitive function to acetylcholine than to so many other transmitters and then aspects of transmission and post synaptic d1 d2 receptor sensitivity and etc so you end up getting imbalances and really key ratios and dynamics mm-hmm so [1629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1629.2s)

that we'll end up looking like with increasing focus but not increasing key aspects of memory or even decreasing some of them or things decreasing things like empathy or presence right and then because you are getting in exitus override to a key in chain chemical it can create dependence and down regulations yeah so our goal was the exact opposite it was we know people [1651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1651.76s)

weren't going to use something if they didn't feel it right away it would just fit in category with all their other vitamins and supplements so it hasn't produce the kinds of immediate effects that they were looking for but we wanted it in a way that would not produce long term down-regulation and that would ideally produce meaningful long-term upregulation well even in the [1672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1672.1s)

short-term having a much wider scope of positive impact so can we increase focus and concentration and short-term memory and working memory long-term memory creativity analysis synthesis all at the same time and a lot of things that are actually almost opposite functions like the ability to stay very focused independent of environmental noise but then the ability to tasks which when one [1695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1695.74s)

needs a tasks which are opposite kinds of functions but we really want them both mm-hmm the ability to have very high drive but also to be able to let go of it and be empathetically interpersonally responsive when necessary mm-hmm analytic and synthetic and so our focus was can we do comprehensive brain chemistry in real-time that makes people that [1715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1715.69s)

up-regulates comprehensive capacities that is also up regulating over the long term and so those those are the things that we saw and we have been quite happy with what's happened so far though one of their component to my feedback is that as you recommend you take qualia during the week and then you don't take it on the weekends i still feel very energetic i [1741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1741.67s)

feel my brain is actually even smarter having taken it but not having to my system on a weekend so that would support what your end goal was here one thing i'll say about that is the the most addictive chemical that's in this stack is caffeine and that's a chemical whose addiction curve most people are pretty familiar with and it's pretty benign everyone metabolize is caffeine [1770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1770.02s)

differently and some people can drink it daily for quite some time and then not drink it and be fine other people will get headaches and it does have a lot to do with caffeine metabolism which is genetic and other factors so what i'd say is this has a relatively small amount of caffeine we have 90 milligrams but in the unique form where it's bound to an antioxidant the antioxidant from [1790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1790.57s)

blueberry skins pterostilbene which has it basically be slow release so it feels like 30 milligrams when it kicks on which is very very subtle but then it lasts for quite some time so instead of getting a spike in a drop off you get a very subtle long-term effect yeah why it's important to take in the morning again because it will last longer for people who are used to drinking a big [1811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1811.179s)

starbucks where they've got 152 milligrams of caffeine the kicks in right away they will still want to do that they just might down regulate the amount a little bit cuz this isn't gonna match with that amount of caffeine but on people's off days we tell people to do five days on two days off qualia so that they don't desensitize to any of the chemicals that are here on their off [1830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1830.74s)

days if you can't get off caffeine without headaches and you can still do your coffee or monta or whatever it is on your off days caffeine doesn't mean cycle that's frequently those other chemicals and so what we'd say is our recommendation is that people should cycle off caffeine if they use it on a daily basis for about one week per quarter hmm so their adenosine cycle [1849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1849.58s)

gets to reset the other dynamics that are involved get reset and we do find that people will start getting decreased meaning for response from caffeine over longer periods of time obviously there's problems if people are using it again as a replacement for sleep or to push through too much fatigue when they actually need rest yeah if people are well-rested and [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1868.299s)

they're taking appropriate amounts of caffeine and it can actually be an efficiency increase our metabolically for their system so we say two days off of quality each week and one week off of all stimulants per quarter i was never much of a coffee drinker growing now several years ago i started to drink it and it became a part of my daily routine rather fast [1888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1888.009s)

i enjoy my coffee with cream and i recognized that i was adding hundreds of calories to my to my day from my coffee routine we know from an energy balance perspective that the body doesn't compensate for calories that are consumed in liquid form as much as it does when they're consumed in solid form so now i get my morning boost without those additional calories and honestly i [1909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1909.099s)

thought i was gonna have a hard time giving up my coffee but that's not been the case so this is another reason why i enjoy qualia when i think bulletproof coffee has become as popular as it has this is a topic people are aware of because they're putting a lot of calories in the form of mct or xct oil in there you know and butter but if someone is doing that and then eating [1930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1930.339s)

the same breakfast that kind of missing the point right exactly most people are doing that to then not eat breakfast for quite some time or they need to down regulate the caloric intake of the breakfast right yeah exactly i was doing the latter what other tools do you use to either monitor your cognitive performance or to enhance it assessment [1951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1951.129s)

wise there are some apps that are fun there's a quantified mind of them is a publicly available app that anybody can use inexpensive and then there are some apps that you can pay just a little bit for that have a lot of increased capacities like cambridge brain science app there's actually two different cambridge associate cognitive assessments berkeley's greater good [1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1973.029s)

science center has a positive psychology assessment upenn has some pretty great non-symbolic experience assessments so there's a number of good online assessments we have a friend dr. zachary stein who was in the education department philosophy education at harvard and worked with howard gardner on what was next beyond multiple lines of intelligence and i would say is one [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=1994.059s)

of the top theorists in developmental psychology he and a group of friends made a assessment system electic a-- and to go to left or you can see it which is probably in all that i'm aware of the most advanced human cognitive psychological assessment system anywhere and it assesses for things like how complex someone's thinking is how abstract their thinking [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2013.74s)

is levels of moral reasoning a lot of things beyond basic psychological and cognitive assessment using really quite deep and good and want models so those are ones that we like in sport we're actually working on synthesizing elements from many of those into apps that can provide better resources for people in the futures one of our goals so those are some things as far as [2033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2033.69s)

biometrics go i use a lot of blood chemistry testing for mmm-hmm biometric assessment and i'm a big fan of qejy assessment i'm a big fan bio data and psycho data and then the key becomes the interpretive process to be able to put it together and really understand what it means to have to it the hard part hard that's the part we're really focused on is because the data [2053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2053.31s)

collection is getting better on moore's law curve we're focused on how do you actually play all the various parts together where you're not just looking at each thing in relationship to a reference range but each thing in relationship to all the other things to get a center just a picture yeah and then as far as other things for cognitive performance enhancements so [2068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2068.97s)

things i do personally there's a lot of cognitive chemistry that i play with and so walia is a base stack i still even after years with it and i've been formulated it and previous stacks that led up to it i still use that private is weak but for different goals if i'm wanting to be in much more new idea creative space or much more execution oriented space there's some number of [2091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2091.38s)

hundreds of other chemicals that i'll play with and so some of those chemicals will come to market some will be things that we educate people about but we could do a whole talk on nootropic chemistry sometimes yeah but also again that's based on me knowing my actual bio data and then optimizing towards that with qualia since we weren't able to do it in a personalized fashion to begin [2111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2111.99s)

with even though that's a goal for us in the future is to be able to do personalized chemistry at the scale the infrastructure for that takes quite a bit of development we focused on what meets center of bellcore chemistry best beyond chemistry for me the other things that i will do meditation every day is actually one of the foundational ones so enough [2128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2128.52s)

sleep meditation everyday exercise that is focused specifically and obviously we get neurogenesis from high-intensity exercise we get neurofen upregulation the circulatory effect is important etcetera but new skill acquisition is huge for neurogenesis more than anything else and new skill acquisition in the form of learning new languages learning new musical [2150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2150.51s)

instruments but it seems right now that learning new motor functions sensory coordination motor functions has the deepest evolutionary biology on creating new neural pathways and so the key is whenever you try and do some new activity like say you're gonna slackline or you're gonna whatever that requires a balance or coordination you just don't have and it seems almost impossible your [2170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2170.22s)

your nervous system is trying to use the much larger bandwidth of other than conscious processing to handle it and just conscious processing but that means driving new neural circuits and then you start to get a hang of it as soon as you start to get a hang of it that effect starts decreasing but if process you actually increased the neural hardware for automating learning and so then you [2190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2190.23s)

switch and do some other one and so continuously focusing on things that are really hard until they start to become easy and then switching again that hardware where you take new learning and automate it then translates to new cognitive and interpersonal and psychologic things that you actually hear rate of learning goes up yeah there's many more but those are a few [2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2210.66s)

examples there's an approach to physical activity that i promote called in tune training it stands for integrative and opportunistic training the goals of it are this to support a sufficiency of physical activity in one's life to reduce longer periods of sedentary time so even if you're somebody who's getting a good total amount of physical activity think of the [2231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2231.119s)

weekend warrior concept where somebody is getting all their physical activity during the weekend but they're largely sedentary during the week in tune helps you fit smaller bursts of physical activity into your days which makes it easier to make it more regular one of the objectives of the program is to optimize mental performance and it does it in several ways first there are brain [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2250.23s)

benefits to regular physical activity second there are acute benefits to getting physical activity within your day especially when you're active activity isn't too intense and third since it instructs you to do some but not a lot of physical activity day by day you're left with a good energetic reserve and what i is that when i do workout in this manner [2268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2268.95s)

i wake up with a lot of energy every single day so that is validating to the concept and then lastly i also dance during the day so i try to mix in more complex movement patterns aside from just squats and push-ups and this sort of whole body coordination supports cognitive strength and in support of that idea as well i also have a slackline outside which i use for [2290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2290.52s)

similar purposes i think there are specific insights that can teach people what is optimum more like what we just talked about with the benefit of dancer slack minor balance whatever but everyone knows quite a bit that they don't fully apply already hard to things like sleep and exercise and lifestyle that's one of the things i'm most excited about the dear human operating [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2311.94s)

system as you continue is all the kind of behavioral support dynamics you're building in so that people can actually start getting traction so yeah max i'm delighted to see that in you awful well last question for you what would you tell somebody who has never taken nootropics before but is curious to drive them do some research mm-hmm educate yourself that is gonna be a [2332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2332.13s)

general mo for me in any health well-being performance related topic mm-hm one of the core kind of concepts means that we hold really heavily here no hacker is topic of empowered responsibility and that the idea that people take relatively little responsibility for their longevity health well-being and then trust other [2350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2350.819s)

people who don't know them that well to tell them what to do and then have side effects and get mattad yeah the doctors for it is just lame it doesn't work right no and so since you're the one that lives in your body and your minds you just gotta  __  take full responsibility for what you can do if you don't understand how it works great a hundred percent well said that's the [2369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2369.48s)

key thing that we would say is study learn and then do experiments as they seem appropriate to you that you feel ready for and of course as part of your study consult the appropriate people that you want consult and you can go to our website and research how we formulated this or the formulation page it has all the ingredients and all the research on each ingredient pathway etc [2391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2391.89s)

and then you can try it and its intended as a potent nootropic stack that is relevant even for people to have a part of the experience with biohacking email hacking but also is one that is very good in entry fashion for many many people and in general if you're new to it i would say start with the lowest dose as possible and if you don't notice there [2413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2413.46s)

the effect feels good but subtle move up and kind of titrate your way up paying attention to your experience great advice one thing i'll say about the experience some people have with nootropics is you might not feel it unless you're doing something that's really challenging your mind if you take it and you're just walking around the day doing remedial tasks you might not [2431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2431.58s)

experience the benefit but if you are doing something we have to concentrate right code something that is challenging your mental resources that's where you might notice the effect one of plastic places where people report like we didn't anticipate this up front but it made perfect sense afterwards was people have reported in huge number ending procrastination mm-hmm specifically that [2452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2452.34s)

things whether it was their taxes or their desk or whatever they was normally put off a law that they could have sustained attention not just that things that they liked but they could have sustained attention that terrible things that they had previously not liked so there was focus with better neutrality and so when you say you'll notice when you actually engage it that's one of the [2472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2472.8s)

areas that has been really fun people noticing when they're engaging in oh should i actually move the things that continuously get on my to-do list and then get moved because i never do them and actually did daniel this is important work i've benefited from using qualia i have loved hearing your approach on how to create the very best version of a cognitive enhancer i've [2493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2493.86s)

been recommending it to friends when the discussion comes up on the subject and interestingly several of those people who have tried it have spontaneously written back to me to tell me what a positive experience they've had with it becoming better at getting stuff done that we care about is hugely valuable this can mean better overall work quality and it can even release you to [2513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2513.72s)

have more free time if you can be more efficient getting your tasks done i believe your system thinking has really helped to develop this product and it's really paid off and i'd like to thank you for taking the time for to have a conversation with me i'm sure our listeners will appreciate the discussion and i'll be sure to put information on where people can find [2534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2534.99s)

in the shownotes awesome and we continue to roll out new technologies new products our website is a good place to check in with it and if you feel like it given your email will tip let people know when new things come out and we are excited to explore more partnership with you in human os and being able to share that as a education and training resource for people that's aligned with [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CElwzOUbsGg&t=2558.12s)
