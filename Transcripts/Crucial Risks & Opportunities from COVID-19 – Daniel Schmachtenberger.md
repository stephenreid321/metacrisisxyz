without further ado i wanna welcome danish man burger i think and if there was one person where people were most people here were like we need danish from iran or we need a specific present and then it was really use i'm super super happy that that then are you coming on and and and gracing us with your [[sensemaking]] ability and today income there's a lot to cover i'm not pretending that we can cover everything [21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=21.84s)

in an hour but i'm hoping that we can at least scratch the surface and point people in the right directions if they want to follow up and yeah i am hoping that i think initially when we spoke we were thinking of taking this kind of all matter and talk about the [[generator function]] of x was and and and and i'm kind of like what are the i guess like more abstract and long-term consequences [42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=42.48s)

from this but i think in the interest of time we have decided to kind of like you pick us up where we are right now now kind of like what are the threads that we should be unraveling more and then we see kind of like how that affects much of the [[generator function|generator functions]] of extension is that you're so worried about so thank you so so much for for coming on today and it's such a pleasure to have you [63](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=63.75s)

here i think you can amuse yourself whenever you want to as a co-host thank you so so much for joining i would love for you to maybe and i'm like to us in by just kind of like taking us on a tour of you know what our kind of current developments where we're not paying enough attention to and where the conversation maybe not paying enough attention to it and it may have major [87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=87.509s)

implications down the line that we shouldn't be missing right now thank you alison for inviting me here this is my first of these to join even though a number of the people that you've had on before people i respect and our friends and colleagues i actually just want to acknowledge first what an awesome thing you're doing here i look at the list of people that you've [111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=111.56s)

had on in the last 10 weeks and only 10 percent of these people are here for the first time it's really kind of an incredible online university and a good use of this time so that's really neat because i haven't been in the previous ones in the poll said people were feeling generally better many of them and you were talking about existential hope and making opportunities can you [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=133.22s)

just kind of clue me in briefly what some of the major themes of the kovat related make things better opportunities are that this group has been following yes okay so there's close out the hive mind which is kind of like the incredible opportunities that are currently popping up for health extension right because suddenly the whole world is worried about about their [161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=161.299s)

health and a lot of the current biotech sector money there was already kind of like available beforehand is really like funneled into vaccines that put about some of the efforts that's on the one end you know a lot of people out of work and that kind of that that may slow innovation donovan on quite significantly then i think on the other hand what we talked about fuses into the [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=189.079s)

promises of the virtual world right we have everything from healer medicine in india to kind like this you know really kind of like flourishing of global online universities and such that may kind of like actually make it much harder for the general monopolies of the kind of kind of broken educational systems that rely on like you know a lot of foreign for foreign student payments [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=212.359s)

to survive it may make it much much harder for them to provide still have this almost like predatory and hinge on the system so it was a lot of like what i want to use in the virtual space are possible right now that vr is almost becoming as good as a human you can as a brain computer interface and then you know we also talked about like the different ways of [235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=235.549s)

in which culture shifting in which people are now like me stepping up and really fantastic ways in which people are times like willing to tap into grey zones and legal areas to save lives in which people are like stepping up and proposing you go defense funds for those you know who are in those gray areas and saving lives for those people who are blowing the whistle and in the sense in [257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=257.12s)

which vaguely centralized communities are coming together and a few technologies that may help us do that much much better in the future and especially from from crypto commerce and but then also how many of those technologies are currently being have been exploited by more totalitarian forms of government and all the ways in which like you know it's a more [281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=281.24s)

predatory state like seeking the nooks and crannies and which to expand their power into it right and so we are usually economic always the risk and opportunities in those area and i mean then we last week we would focus more on the kind of global scale and in the ways in which currently you know we have a ton of people that are really really good at [301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=301.789s)

[[sensemaking]] we have a ton of people that are really good at modeling meticulous fhi they all came out fantastic modeling efforts but it's just so happens that no one's really listening we have really good prediction tools already people working on them but it still kind of feels that they're not really effectively informing action yet but you know there are a few ways like [321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=321.41s)

you know we talked about dow democracy about future keys and so on but but they're just not really entering the mainstream discourse so like my main fear is that there are actually a lot of opportunities available and but a lot of those people like i think many of us as they're thinking along those lines are just not being insulted so i'm one one kind of choice at me because you have [343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=343.639s)

this in either but there's kind of a parallel operating system and hope that we can take over and take over the system is taking effect or we can try to try to reform but but it just doesn't need to make there as much opportunity to bail in right now so those are i guess a few things that we've been talking about i can go on the laundry list but then i think i would be [365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=365.69s)

running the salon i definitely don't want to be doing that i get it we can't meet in person can we meet online and are there unique opportunities to being able to meet online if healthcare is  up can we use it to reform healthcare writ large if education gets totally disrupted rather than have you know just a generation that has major gaps in their education can we reform [392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=392.33s)

education i would like a classic example right now is the [[food supply]] chain is we've basically by stopping travel to be stopped the movement of the virus we also stop the movement of fertilizers and pesticides and key [[supply chain]] dynamics that have led to this massive culling of animals and throwing dairy away and tilling food back into the soil so we have basically excessive supply [416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=416.05s)

that can't get where it needs so it's getting ruined while the demand hasn't actually gone down it's just we can't route it you know properly and the perishability and the thin margins are such that we're actually driving hunger at scale so the [[food supply]] system for give or take two billion people just got  and so then we're like okay well having a [[supply chain]] that has that many steps of vulnerability and it isn't a good idea so if we have to fix it right now and we do because otherwise tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people don't go hungry peacefully right so you start to get a movement from a virus to broken [[supply chain|supply chains]] to hunger to violence to war escalation so let's say we're looking at the fact that nigeria has the largest food insecurity [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=468.169s)

population and population density in the world 26 million give or take people without food security and that their food system just got completely damaged and what happened here plus their economy because they're there based on the price of oil right like almost their entire economy is based on the price of oil which just had this massive saudi arabia russia oil shock kind of thing [487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=487.46s)

and you look at what that starts to look like in terms of both so you know boko haram is increasing and local gangs are increasing and and then insurgency movements so do we start to see a massive exit a serious style from nigeria well after syria and the damage that happened to the eu where do those people go because you doesn't want to take them [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=508.76s)

right and it's under such massive fracture pressures already after brexit and after kovat that some places take them and others don't what does that do kind of for fracture pressure so so this is when you can start to see how like a cascade of events like this goes we take the damage to the [[food supply]] that's happened in india india and bangladesh are particularly interesting because of [532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=532.82s)

the population density multiplied by total population that is near food vulnerabilities and so you start to get a damage to the [[food supply]] system they are and the total number of people that can be affected is just unprecedented is astronomical and we were looking at this before co vid from [[climate change]] so remember the year started off with australia burning right and wow there [558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=558.62s)

were a number of factors there was an environmental mismanagement that led to too much downed wood because they had prevented small fires and not dealt with the forestry well and because groundwater had been used up irresponsibly in whatever there were a number of factors but increased dryness and heat was one of the major factors so then we started looking at [[climate change]] mediated not just do we have a climate that takes out the ability for people to live as a whole which we're not going to get which is why caesar and fhi whatever don't look at [[climate change]] that much but they should when they factor cascade effects which is do you have a climate dynamic that leads to like for instance this upcoming summer in india and bangladesh are estimated to [605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=605.089s)

have 52 celsius heat waves independent of kovat well that is enough to actually destroy most of their staple crops and so when you don't have food stores singing meaningful enough food stores you can destroy the staple crops and you have people that are right on the edge of basic needs being unmet then what happened so then do the people in like without groundwater [627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=627.32s)

and without food and 52 celsius heat just die peacefully right or do they start to try to get access to the limited resources and then violence emerges over limited resources so where do those violence lines cleave along well they cleave along existing tension lines so does that look like hindu muslim tension lines sure and so then does that look like india pakistan [650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=650.48s)

tension it starts to mount and you start to see the cascade that happens when you have systemic fragility of this kind so now we still have that upcoming set of heat waves to deal with in india on top of the fact that we already just had a unanticipated crop failure ahead of that okay so now we're talking about how do we rebuild things does anybody want to rebuild this [[food supply]] system the way that it is like no it's the most terrible thing you can imagine right because if you're gonna do factory farming nobody wants that near them because it's gruesome right it's environmentally gruesome it's ethically gruesome it's like nobody wants those jobs they have to usually be the jobs or largely run by immigrants who have no other option and so if you're gonna do [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=695.42s)

gruesome [[factory farm|factory farms]] and they have to be in the areas that will accept them then you have to ship them to far distances then you also have to have a very fragile [[supply chain]] that can break from something like cobit so let's say we want to make our [[supply chain|supply chains]] less fragile that also means we want to increase locality if you want to increase locality you have to have types [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=716.15s)

of agriculture that people are okay seeing which is actually really good right because the ability to ship the horror somewhere else right the open-pit mining or the mountaintop removal mining or the [[factory farm]] or the landfill that we can ship the horse somewhere else but nobody has to see it depend on lots of shipping and everybody thinks that life is pretty cool around here because we [735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=735.05s)

put all the ugly parts somewhere else that is actually one of the things that drives systemic fragility so if we start saying well how do we increase food security well one aspect is can we start increasing locality in food systems well doing that will also require making food systems that are better for soil better for animal welfare better for the environment better for human health on [755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=755.75s)

and on right so and better for preventing future zoonotic pandemics that occur in places where you have a bunch of sick animals in a tight environment so it's important to remember that right before china had you know sars co2 emerged they had to kill a humungous percentage of all their pigs because of a swine flu that emerged because of terrible pork bass factory [784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=784.2s)

farming and and they had another major bird flu outbreak india had a bird flu outbreak because [[factory farm|factory farms]] are terrible and they shouldn't exist so that's an example of something that just broke that we have to rebuild because the consequence of not rebuilding it is too destructive for the world and we need to rebuild it differently there's a bunch of other examples like this so [809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=809.82s)

pretty much the way i see kovat is that it was just a large enough global issue to set off the cascade effects of systemic fragilities that would have been set off by something and so now the major issues that we're looking at are we you know like let's say we look at so we just talk about [[food supply]] let's say we look at the economy well we already had a situation with a percentage of [838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=838.02s)

global gdp that went to debt servicing was so high that the economy was fundamentally dead and broken right and we needed to restructure it in some deep way because you can't have that much of total gdp going to debt servicing well as a result of kovat gdp dropped everywhere and that went way the up and we were already at an existential level of gdp to debt ratio so it's like [860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=860.37s)

okay so what what are the economic effects of trying to keep propping that system up and if you play them out they're terrible what does it take to fix it can we actually redo global financial monetary policy central banking policy what is the biggest type of step we could actually make in this place i think it's important to note you know [888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=888.41s)

you were mentioning something that might be able to decrease predatory opportunism in in certain places like we were at education i would say since cove it has been happening predatory opportunism has increased more than i have ever seen it in any other time or that i can think of in history because when the market gets more volatile there's a lot more money to be made if [914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=914.93s)

you know how to make it there's a lot more money to be lost there's also a lot more money to be made because there's more movement occurring so if you're the one that is at the top of the power-law distribution of intelligence and ability to actuate then you're going to do very well and we saw that right we saw some people get stupidly rich during the great depression relative to everyone [931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=931.939s)

else and also get more total asymmetry of wealth as if most people were getting poorer so it's a the volatility increases asymmetries so when you look at all the private intelligence companies that when people leave cia and nsa and whatever that's where they go to work with those capabilities who contracts them who are their main customers well it's financial [954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=954.43s)

institutions are the biggest customer there's plenty of other ones right but hedge funds and private equity funds whatever so in terms of who was getting briefings in december and then early january this is why you saw senators selling stock in january regarding oh this is actually a big deal and this is going to affect the world if i run a hedge fund and the market is near [979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=979.639s)

the top of what the market has ever been at and can't keep going like that forever and i see that there's about to be a major set of hits even if i hypothetically have a lot of money and a lot of power and a lot of access and i could try to use that to get the c-d-c in the w-h-o to do the right thing to save a lot of lives that's not my job and it's not what my incentive is my [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1000.069s)

incentive is to say this is the time to sell all my stocks at the top of the market i'm gonna get a rebuy them at the bottom of the market when they are radically decreased in price and consolidate the out of the total power base i'm also gonna short the market on the entire way down i'm gonna start shorting airlines and whatever else it is and because of [1019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1019.779s)

asymmetric information asymmetric intelligence i'm gonna know about oil shock issues and food chalk issues and whatever to be able to know which commodities to short and which ones to put options on ahead of time then there were a lot of pools of capital like sovereign wealth funds and family offices that big pools of liquid capital that could not be well deployed recently [1039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1039.52s)

because we had negative interest rates on bonds and so it's like i can't just leave my money sitting somewhere and have it make money and negative interest rates are because the market was so broken because so much of the money was going to debt servicing and the global wealth inequality was so much that you had to basically just keep pumping free money which is what negative interest is [1060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1060.4s)

to keep the system from collapsing and so and you didn't have very high volatility so now those huge pools of sovereign wealth and you know liquid capital are like awesome we get a buy up infrastructure for pennies on the dime right and consolidate power law so the people who have most access to intelligence and actuation capacity have been busier than ever during this time [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1087.309s)

not relaxing right if you're if you have less to do you know that you are not at the power law distribution at the top of the power law distribution because those people are seeing this as a maximum opportunity space but it's the opportunity to be able to say oh you know lots of volatility and it's not just volatility in markets it's also awesome this is a great way to roll out [1113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1113.16s)

the surveillance tech we were wanting to roll out to get all of that data for surveillance capitalism or to increase the power of states if that's our particular thing to do so that's and now people will go for it right or we can at least force it through or situations where people won't be able to tend to elections in the same way they would have previously been able to because of [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1139.03s)

health issues is a great time to try and manipulate elections so or if i'm china and i'm trying to advance the belt and road initiative and there were some sticky places that weren't moving through and it happens to be that i'm really only manufacture ppe at decent scale in the world the places that wouldn't sign the belt and road initiative before well [1159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1159.37s)

now if that's the only way that they get to not die of the plague is that we come help them out and also not die of poverty as their economy crashes or let's say that we're russia wanting to get the eastern alliance baltic state back and kind of weaken nato forces in eu or so just kind of you could think about all the power players they're all motivated to do the they were [1181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1181.48s)

already doing but where you have during the equilibrio phase it's much harder to change the total relative power during that time where you break up the equilibrium you can have much more radical changes of power coming out the other side like you know think about the u.s. coming out clearly the world leader of world war ii not going in that position and britain coming out [1203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1203.529s)

radically downregulated everyone who is sophisticated in the game of power is seeing this as that type of thing and so i would say the fragility has set off like we have increased meaningfully increased risk of violence in the us and in other developed areas at the social level of just how many people are are freaked out right like they have very partial [[sensemaking]] in a world dominated by a [[narrative warfare]] and information warfare so nobody feels like they can actually make real sense so they just do tribalism stuff and so they're and it's tricky right so they see i'm a right oriented person i don't know particular people that have died but i also live in a low population density area and everything on the news is totally suspect as fake news and i'm [1255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1255.159s)

afraid of the idea that the the corruption and conspiracy and whatever would be happening to control things and actually go down and look at my local hospital and there's nobody there and it's empty and i see a few other things of like empty hospitals no of course if you actually have a pandemic going on you will try to stop elective processes and so you will have [1276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1276.309s)

doctors going out of business and empty hospitals while also having a real pandemic but there's some sophistication and nuance to be able to make sense of that whole thing and if i don't have it partial perspective is pretty compelling right so then i'm like oh they're trying to take our freedoms away we founded this country based on the right to bear arms and you know stand up [1294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1294.69s)

against our government so that thing starts to happen right and and then you see simultaneous to that black guy running gets shot protests happens a bunch of bunch of black people doing a protest carrying guns right and so you see the like oh there's lots of sides that are at meaningful tension with each other increasing the signaling of violence then we see the actual violence [1319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1319.019s)

increasing in in certain areas riots that happened in london and whatever and then very meaningful stuff in places like nigeria and then we see bigger things like i don't think most people pay enough attention but when you look at general mcchrystal coming out a few weeks ago saying i'm gonna be using advanced darpa technology to counter the fake news that trump is putting out [1346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1346.079s)

people should pay attention when a four-star general who ran covert ops for the us military whose job was to overthrow governments from the inside using tools of [[narrative warfare]] he talks about using advanced ai semantic capability developed by darpa to go against the standing president like that should be a signal if you were paying attention oh what the that is [1369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1369.059s)

closer to civil war i don't know what signals are closer right so you just start looking at all those types of things and you look at the increased attention and signaling regarding militarism between us and china and on and on so we could go by sector whether we talk about the financial sector the economic sector movements towards violence grid security and say the [1390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1390.179s)

existing risks that were there just got accelerated by like a decade in almost all areas i mean now the question is to come out the other side not way way way worse requires dealing with all that not just dealing with the virus but dealing with the second and third order effects that have already kicked off and if we don't deal with that we will come out way way worse in order to deal with it [1416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1416.639s)

we have to do deep enough changes that we will say hey we don't want to redo [[food supply]] this way or monetary policy this way and we could come out much better but that requires that the people who are thinking about how to do it better have to be as effective at making happen at a global scale as the groups that are currently working on power [1435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1435.21s)

consolidation yeah i think yeah man there are so many things like i mean one of the things just like you know i think echoing would like living off a few of the things that that you mentioned one of the things was like being the belton vote initiative right like i think in a previous podcast somebody mentioned what what if china was actually tying that you know kind of [1459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1459.19s)

like to the you know to the to the condition of using their digital currency right then like many of the kind of like digital currencies and like of the promises of freedom that were excited about of them previously would kind of like fall to the wayside then right and i think the same is true when when you look at like i mean if i look on if i think back of how this all [1483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1483.1s)

started and how can i try optimistic i was that there's a ton of opportunities to do an incredible amount of good and we've been thinking about this and i think really really smart people are on it and i think about it and i talking about it but meanwhile like if i actually look at what's happening in the world in the meantime it seems like things are just slowly getting worse and [1503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1503.8s)

worse a little bit like on a very kind of like in a personal level like i was out in san francisco a few days ago and like they were like street conic car races on the street right like people with motorcycles with cars racing out like multiple people's like peeing in the park he's totally overwhelmed like police every every 5 meters wherever i went [1523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1523.24s)

like people just like totally wasted everywhere on the street and i was like wow this is very different to like the types of worlds that we're thinking about on a daily basis and those global sell-off so you know it's kind of like weird to see that delta between meanwhile like it's kind of painful to see like we are always thinking and in in ways in which the system could be [1544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1544.18s)

much better but like it adjustment like we're not taking into account many of the kind of like just very real physical kind of like physical constraints that are like that are kind of corny and making people move right and i feel like the same is true like on you know if we think about it on a global scale in terms of and what what may not happen with oil like one of the [1564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1564.55s)

things that we've been talking about is that on the one and it's it's somewhat grade that all futures are negative because for ones we may be able to make them move to like we knew and energy but on the other hand also totally terrifying right because that may mean like much much more likely that we enter into like final conflict between [1583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1583.21s)

different powers and especially with the us couldn t realize it doesn't have a chip in order on a global scale right like we've never seen connect like nations convict in international water moving peacefully or like switching peacefully right so it's like it's just seems like it's a total weird cognitive dissonance by which you can dream up was really amazing changes that could be [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1605.68s)

occurring meanwhile things are moving really quickly in all sorts of directions and in really complicated ways with not only second-order effects but like that's why i mentioned the currency like the you know potentially chinese kind of like maybe are ordering something like you know that digital currency if they ever kind of like enforcing they like the development both [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1624.4s)

on many others that's on the second order that's almost like a third order effect so i my question so it's a long-winded way of saying there's it seems to be a ton of opportunity this needs to be a ton of risk it seems like we have really smart people together often and i'm also speaking about your circles they're thinking really well about this and you just mentioned how [1642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1642.79s)

intelligent people within the system are gaining could make a ton of money by gaming the system with the information that they have so what is kind of like the kinds of information that we could be using and the kinds of kind of a comparative advantage that we may have in putting that to the table to create a better world or not the worst ones of those something i was personally really impressed with and i don't mean in a good way just impressed upon me when i first started encountering the halls of power in the world more so top of government and the finance and like that is how few people there were actually really good thinkers they were smart enough to understand how to execute [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1698.96s)

certain types of things not particularly creative not particularly systemic not particularly critical but like just basically smart enough they were mostly ambitious like super ambitious and super hard-working and slanted heavily in the cluster b direction cluster b meaning dsm-5 personality disorder specifically the power seeking ones that are willing because like if [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1728.269s)

you don't have something psychologically wrong with you for the most part those are really miserable lives to be continuously engaging with people that are trying to you over and stab you in the back and lied to you so that you can just get more power that doesn't equate to a meaningful quality of life and have no real relationships because the only people that are interacting [1747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1747.769s)

with you want something from you like you there has to be something mostly psychologically wrong with you to want to gain a lot of power so the psychological dispositions that are power seeking you call it sociopathy psychopathy narcissism tend to be willing to put up with the difficulties and do the up things necessary to win a lot of win-lose games and get to [1768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1768.88s)

the top of the power law distribution of power systems and sometimes you actually need to not have complex thoughts so that you can avoid looking at the externalities you're causing and that you can give [[plausible deniability]] even to yourself and to be able to just execute on some simple things which is usually where more power comes from so then i see [1793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1793.27s)

people who care more and have more complex thinking not want to do things that will cause lots of externalities and think about what the quality of life in their short period of time being alive is and not necessarily want to be engaged in those types of financial warfare and political warfare whatever all the time and so they just don't ever get much power which also means they [1814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1814.93s)

don't influence things very much so basically there is a disposition there is a systemic disposition that makes sociopaths and they're like mostly run the world and until we actually fix that we are just on a movement towards self induced determination i mean like you know why the worst rise to the top and and and all of like all of those arguments that i think i usually really [1845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1845.38s)

you know arguments against the consolidation of power lloyd and i think that you've in previous podcast and i mean you're writing on it a lot of connect systems that are not currently being built and the crypto commerce base in which at least you could have better [[sensemaking]] tools that and i would make it would make those kind of tendencies much harder but you know i wonder [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1864.85s)

whether you know you're proposing that like should we reform or should we exit and build new one that speak orthogonal to that question first just addressing that question i would say there's there's roughly three horizons of focus that i pay attention to i pay attention to like immediate triage which isn't trying to reform the current systems and it isn't [1894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1894.71s)

trying to build new ones it's just trying to keep some terrible from happening that we can't fix afterwards and so like how do we prevent massive death in india right now and massive escalation of violence we're not even we're not gonna fix capitalism or fix corruption or we'll fix the current indian government to do that it's like can we can we do the [1916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1916.97s)

right things with [[supply chain|supply chains]] and hade and to be able to prevent because there are some issues that you can prevent but you can't fix them after they've happened they they are irreversibly destructive and so one of the things i'm very focused on is the kind of [[sensemaking]] that shows us the escalation pathways to various types of irreversible [[catastrophic risk]] so that we can identify the most targeted interventions to stop those things from happening so that's actually neither fixing the current systems nor making better ones right that's just keep the patient from bleeding out then there is how do we work with the current institutions to make them better because we're not gonna have post capitalist post nation-state post democratic [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1962.96s)

societies running the world in the next few years or just there's no way that's gonna happen and it's not even gonna happen in the generation their generational shift has to occur for the up leveling of systemic [[sensemaking]] and for good systems that start to happen somewhere to get through the resistance necessary to be the primary operating system so that means that the you know [1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=1984.35s)

fifty to a hundred trillion dollars that trades hands every day that is that much collective human incentive in human behavior is going to keep running through the systems it's running through for a while so we have to take those systems and make them less terrible not even say more good just less terrible and that's kind of the second horizon of focus is institutional repair [2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2005.769s)

how do we take and most of the institution's we currently have were better when they were created and then they decayed because predatory opportunism kind of decayed them and that's actually if you you know sam oh probably spoke about that when he was on here michael vassar might have the theory of institutional decayed civilizational decay so if we look at [2027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2027.429s)

the way that the american republic was initially intended it would it's it's not a perfect form of governance and it of course doesn't address how to deal with a decentralized [[exponential tech]] world and and facebook like it doesn't they weren't thinking about those issues so we need something better than that but it's so many thousands of times better than the we have right now [2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2049.359s)

that is basically like a maximally corrupt kleptocracy pretending to be a republic and not even pretending all that much because it doesn't matter what people think cuz they don't do anything which was very clear in things like the epstein case or even co vid right now but epstein case was very interesting to me because that marked the hallmark in my witnessing in the us where some [2074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2074.109s)

people still believed in the news to where nobody actually believed in the news if they were paying attention because when epstein died all of the major publications whether they were believed to be right leaning or left leaning their major publications continuously and only said when epstein commits suicide in prison and i just don't know anyone that actually thinks [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2098.589s)

that he commits suicide in prison and so what that meant was everyone said hmm what what the is that if the left and the right leaning and supposedly owned by different people and different organizations and they're all saying something that nobody believes and then but still nobody does about it because nobody thinks they can do anything about it and they're all on [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2118.66s)

benzos and opiates and porn and facebook so the they're kind of too weakened and addicted to do anything anyways plus if you think about trying to go do something about it you're like okay don't revolutions require violence the swat team has tanks like what the do we do against tanks so how do you deal with these things when it seems like there things are actually relatively comfortable and no matter how upset i get by the time i've scrolled facebook for five minutes i forgot right like the hypernormal stimulus is strong enough that i forgot and the seeming chance of succeeding at something seems so hard that people just it doesn't really matter so we don't even have to pretend that there is a republic that much [2162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2162.16s)

anymore on the epstein thing it's important to just kind of say here people who paid attention there said okay wait so mueller said when he was trying him the first time said publicly i was told to shut this case down that he's a epstein as a us intelligence asset that's above my pay grade okay and then we find out the things epstein was involved in and we and then we hear [2196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2196.84s)

the names it would be part of the court investigation if it went the next day which involves presidents on both the republican and democrat side let lots of other people say so this is the most important court case in the history of the us where multiple presidents on both sides and you know people of all kinds of power are possibly going to be indicted for like some of the worst [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2220.95s)

crimes people can think about and the dude dies in jail on suicide watch and the cameras go off and everything the day before we're like okay wait does that mean that the there isn't really a justice system and the there isn't really a police system as part of a justice system and there isn't really news and the intelligence agencies are part of are involved in things that [2243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2243.01s)

involve like child sex trafficking anyone who's paying attention had all those thoughts and then just started do another again so the topic that comes up for me here is what does it take to think about better systems and solutions but then what does it take to go implement them and to be as effective at implementing as okay if i want to protect the rainforests in [2278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2278.029s)

south america i have to be more effective than the multinationals and the national interests behind trying to cut the rainforests down which is the ccp major chinese multinationals european multinationals some kremlin forces from super corrupt politicians doing all those types of things we lose the amazon if it continues to be some very incompetent [2298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2298.969s)

ngos against those forces so if you want to actually keep it you actually have to be able to out influence them and that's one of the things that i'm really wanting to see is typically people only start to engage in the game of influence which is also the game of power if they are oriented towards power seeking in ways that makes them not good stewards of power and the world is from [2323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2323.63s)

this for people who are trustworthy who could be good stewards of power of groups who could be they will not for their own intrinsic reasons be oriented to want to do that but the ones who could for the collective good be willing to step up into that shitty life of engaging in the game of power because it's actually good for the whole that is one of the critical things that is [2346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2346.039s)

needed for the world to make you right now and that's neither new systems oh so i went off that's neither like there's triage work there's fix the existing systems there's making new better systems but all of them require being able to move stuff effectively at a global scale yeah i think one thing you know like one thing about the [[sensemaking]] my parrot is like if you make an elephant in the brain when henson kind of points out - why can like his work on predictions why he thinks said it has never been picked up and it's basically like people don't want to know what's going to happen because that means that people could have predicted wrong which means you can hold people accountable for having predicted wrong and firing made wrong decisions and people don't [2387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2387.229s)

want that they just want to corrected you treat themselves and say no to each other trying to do the best but meanwhile no one actually really cares whether anything like were there anything gets done and like and i do worry you know that even if we had pretty good since making a purchase is like you know maitake ism and a few other tools [2403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2403.56s)

already out there that are really quite fantastic but they seem to not be coupled to actuators right and and you could say well either we can't wake up the establishment so that they you should be using something like a few jerky vgm a few degree government system or we try to kind of like do better ourselves which you know then again comes to the point of like who's willing [2422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2422.07s)

to step out within our communities to kind of like looking forward and do that you know and then and i think actually mean well i mean you know just i think it came out today or yesterday or something right like twitter and facebook just like now cooperating with cdc and was a wh or something to and to try to make sense of like fake news posts about about covert 19 which then [2442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2442.23s)

tricks people and having their sickness trust and any type of [[sensemaking]] apparatus anymore that's kind of like vaguely in the mainstream right and and people just getting more and more down the conspiracy alley because you know as you said within the epstein case like it doesn't really seem like anyone can be trusted anymore and w john another like you know organs are telling you like one [2463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2463.349s)

day don't wear masks the next day totally wear masks and like it's all so confusing it's really really hard to come back figure out who to trust but i do actually think that this community has this intrinsic benefit of like being able to have have called the shots really really early and so you know i just want to kind of like maybe poke a little bit more on that [2483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2483.839s)

you know what would it you already saying well it is almost a property of those people who should step up to do something that they inherently don't want to and and and that those who want to may not be the right people who should we should do it so how do you incentivize those people if at all or like you know what i specific kind of like projects that you think could [2505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2505.65s)

require a leader right now do you think would be good people to take something on like you know if you're talking quite locally in quite actionable like what what would you like people and this community you focus on more and then you know maybe we can outsource it amongst ourselves and take them on i would be very in heartened if the rationalists community and ea community [2531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2531.78s)

started to use words like sacred and devotion more and not as a kind of it intellectually makes sense that there is a thing that we can define this way semantically and or it's a signal ii kind of thing but from having experiences of and i don't mean to define them in some kind of pre rational religious way but sacred what is most precious what is most meaningful to me [2571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2571.75s)

and what is meaningful to me more than my own experience in my own life and why is my own experience in my own life even meaningful and what does that tell me about the value of life and experience as a whole and then in light of that what am i what is my devotion to and to not just what has the best utility function they move in different parts of us and you have to do both if you read [2598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2598.03s)

the daodejing as a book of leadership it basically says in many different ways the person who really wants to lead everybody should run away from because there's something wrong with that guy and they're probably basically psychologically a child and the person who really really doesn't want to lead and everyone pushes into the position [2623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2623.65s)

because everyone trusts them from how they show up as long as that person doesn't start to identify with their world too much they can probably do it an aria job but you asked how do we kind of push people there i would say if people meditate on what is actually sacred to you what do you want your life to be in service to you what do you really understand is going on in the [2648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2648.13s)

world right now and let that be more of what has your attention than your to-do list or your facebook feed then they will start to be a sense of what you can't not do and it's not just for you know personal disposition but what the greater collective need and what's meaningful calls - yeah i mean i think you know the rationalists and i've never been there [2673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2673.599s)

but have vesicular saucers for example right and and i do think that that kind of like feeling is something that i want to tap into with existential hope like is he created this website with that positive visions for humanity and like is more like a philosophy and kind of like um blog really that i think because if you if you talk to many people that have done incredible things they have [2695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2695.17s)

done them because they've read very early very inspiring stuff that never that they could never forget about right like it came from this like total kind of like internal admiration for this incredible future that that they could see or for this you know really like an incredible kind of like almost like aesthetic flow state or something that that came from an intrinsically positive [2717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2717.67s)

place and i think that's an incredibly kind of like stable motivator right it doesn't you know it doesn't make you it doesn't make you stop very very very very quickly right and so i think having that and having that in community i think is a really motivating force i would kind of like i'm worried a little about you know like electing like the the global leader i think you know one [2742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2742.69s)

thing that we also often tend to talk about in this communities is like well it took us a really long time in history to kind of like stop asking who should be in power but to start asking more like you know what kinds of architectures can we create kind of like which empower more people right so even there i think you know this kind of like tendency of electing you know the the [2763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2763.259s)

right person you know maybe we can we can do a little better than that and if we get the right education is in place and i'm i'm curious whether you know you could point to a few specific kind of like i guess like cooperation architectures or ways in which you think people are already cooperating well that we could model off it seems to me that you allison are personally working your [2792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2792.119s)

ass off to make these videos available to everyone that you're personally taking a bunch of leadership initiative during this time to make a more beautiful future that you feel inspired to do and that you care about and everybody's wouldn't be here if you weren't doing that and everyone is appreciating and they're not all taking equal leadership and making it happen [2815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2815.07s)

don't get confused that decision architectures to come about still don't take people taking leadership action and make them happen like who the figures out the decision architectures who implements them who gets people involved that's always it's like inspiration on the behalf of some people that makes those things happen so don't underweight that that is that can be a [2839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2839.43s)

bridge to people saying i'm gonna take leadership not to hold leadership forever i'm gonna try and take some leadership to create things that help everyone be able to participate in leadership and more democratized in better ways and that is the healthy right kind of leadership the right kind of leadership is i will use some asymmetric influence or power in a way [2859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2859.26s)

that tries to increase everyone else's access to be able to do that as well rather than to continue to increase my own asymmetry of power over everyone else that's the what i would call legitimate versus a legitimate power and so what i'm proposing is that a legitimate power has a necessary function in moving us to a post illegitimate power or dynamic world are [2880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2880.95s)

you going to relaunch the americans project and if so please or if not please could you present the main thesis thesis slash aims to members of the hive they're unfamiliar with it thanks the emergence project was a name of some kind of research and aspirations i was engaged in like a decade ago which is just part of this ongoing thread for me of how to understand the nature of the [2928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2928.109s)

problems in a way that gives rise to better solutions and implement them that was a particular point in time with a particular set of collaborators and the work the insights advanced a lot since then so i wouldn't say relaunch that i would say that was a step in a lot of steps for me they were you know i like i started with activism young and there were certain problems i really [2956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2956.609s)

cared about and then i saw that the projects working on solving those problems just moved the problems and caused other problems and like i very personally saw that like we worked to get fences around to preserve for elephants in africa but it didn't address the underlying poverty and basis of why there were poachers or the poacher started moving to hunt the [2977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2977.849s)

mountain gorillas and the white rhino both of which were more endangered and i'm like we just worked super hard to make the world worse because we just had more endangered animals get poached and i started looking at all the places where that happens i'm like it's pretty much everything because we we defined the problems too narrowly and so our solution to a narrowly defined problem [2997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=2997.14s)

ends of externalizing harm in other areas so i started looking at more and more of the problems how they interconnected and then are their underlying generators that give rise to them and then also how are they are there things that are getting worse which got me in the catastrophic and [[existential risk]] and then i'm like man there's so many [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] if we solve the top 10 we'd only buy like 10 years because there's thousands of them they're all driven by the same [[generator function]] so we can't just deal with them all kind of as instances we have to deal with the whole class so that led me to thinking about why do humans use white what is it about human architecture human behavioral architectures that has us keep [3043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3043.22s)

developing more power and using it badly and what would it take to be able to not have us be bad stewards of power technological power using it badly on purpose warfare and rivalry and whatever or using it badly not on purpose meaning just externalities but you know they have cumulative effects in that scale so that gave rise to this kind of [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[existential risk]] work and then thinking about are there categorical solution - those [[generator function|generator functions]] that make a new civilization model the kernel of a new civilization those a bunch of years of work to kind of figure out what are there and can we define a necessary and sufficient set of design criteria for a civilization that can have [[exponential tech]] and not self-terminate we came up in that research that the answer is yes that there is actually architectures that are possible there doesn't mean we'll get there they're hard but there are possible things so then there was how do we work on building that and then also the next step was well that's gonna take generations and we don't get there currently if we don't do a whole bunch [3109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3109.67s)

of the you know triage work and working to change the current institution so what kind of both intelligence and influence needs to happen so there's that's kind of the progression of interests and projects and emergence project was one kind of step in that inquiry i just shared from hoping that is one of them another let's say data stage in that in your projection and [3140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3140.84s)

maybe i mean it's now 7:00 p.m. so what we usually do is like people whoever wants to stay on stay on but now i always want to give to my panelists like an easy way to go maybe i mean you super welcome to stay on and sure there's a ton of questions but you know maybe as the final words or as words to lead on to a nexus fashion and like what are kind of like things that are currently [3169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3169.28s)

on your mind whatever kind of like next things that you will be focusing your attention on tomorrow and the days after and just for context if people go their civilization emerging as a blog i put up a few years ago put a few articles on and then haven't put anything on in several years and there's like a new economic series part 1 2 3 4 it was supposed to be in eight part series so i [3193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3193.7s)

described several parts of what's wrong with economics and then never get around to finishing explaining what to do with it because there's other stuff that became a higher priority there's maybe still some value and some most of stuff that i've been focused on doesn't have a particular public face because not all projects benefit from a lot of attention [3213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3213.85s)

but there is a project that i'm working to get over the line that will have a public face and that i would be very interested in this community's feedback on and participation with which is a basically a site that will be trying to help correct the information ecology in the [[epistemic commons]] by doing both being able to vet the information space for the information that has highest [3249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3249.21s)

confident intervals and most significance and being able to share that in the right form so kind of not news but meta news but then also being able to show the epistemic process by which we come to that so people don't just get better information to do sense-making but better information processing capabilities so sometime in the next month or so beta version of [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3271.44s)

that should be up and i look forward to hear people's thoughts on it very cool yes today we had two models out here one on infinity project which is like a vague way in which we could model the whole economy and then the other one by jaime jarvis on your own accord 19 argument chains from corcovado to view and if you guys have connected but maybe that will be useful some pointed touch [3293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3293.07s)

base on as well and you see i want to yeah oh great okay it's super well i want to give you the chance to attempt like to gracefully bow out here and meanwhile you're also very very well to stay on i'm sure thank you i'm happy to hop off people like to talk about things when the speaker leaves but i'm also happy to stay and answer questions if that's desired okay i'm gonna meet you [3315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3315.69s)

had a bunch of questions and i think the last one that you posted yeah that looked quite good i'm gonna need you now all right so first of all i'm a big fan of all the stuff i've been amazed by your videos and thoughts and so on the second my question is historically the entities that gained civilization like and became [[superorganism|superorganisms]] their religions and i'm curious if you have any ideas of how to create anti rivals or game be ich religion like structures and what advantages and disadvantages there are in kind of co-opting or hijacking the religious aspect of the brain in order to you know steer a burgeoning civilization in that way yeah it's actually really worth studying the religions that had in some meaningful [3379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3379.83s)

endurance and were less directly violent so studying the quakers studying the jews like there's some very interesting things regarding how those [[collective intelligence]] systems worked jews specifically being a diaspora not having a physical location to defend or to be able to rest upon had to create this kind of decentralized [[collective intelligence]] system to have synchrony well-being in embedding cultures so there's yeah there's a bunch of interesting things to study there and of course we can look at the jains and the buddhists and groups that historically had non-violence as higher principles and you see that like tibet can stay safe for a pretty long time until it actually becomes a risk and then it gets [3438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3438.16s)

taken over by a militaristic force pretty easily right and so one of the tricky things has been and this is like when you look at one of the things that blows my mind is looking at the history of christianity and saying okay so when we look at the inquisition or the witch trials or the crusades or any of the things that said they were in jesus's name and then you look at the gospels of [3467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3467.89s)

jesus saying let he who has no sin cast the first stone like how the did people figure out that piece of mental gymnastics to do that thing right so you start to see an evolution and you can see like the essenes went jane direction with christian kind of ideas and then the crusades went a different direction so it's almost like you the religion is like a mimetic complex and it can [3492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3492.04s)

undergo mutation and some of those will have it propagate more and defend itself against external forces more typically those are the ones that move it in the direction of effective violence not always often so one of the big questions becomes how does a peaceful culture stay peaceful well not being overtaken by warring cultures medically economically or military [3521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3521.589s)

because if the warring culture is willing to initiate that thing in the peaceful culture loses by default then that doesn't work but if the peaceful culture to be able to defend itself against a militarized culture has to reallocate all of its attention to being better at warfare than the militarized culture it's not a peaceful culture anymore so there is that's a question i [3540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3540.26s)

spent a lot of time with and there are some very interesting insights on that but that's like a whole that would take another conversation there's some graphical so i'm curious if you know are there less violent militaristic examples or at least an idea of how to structure a system that isn't that isolated and still doesn't involve the militaristic ethos and so i mentioned the jews and [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3576.29s)

then also even the quakers when they were say embedded within dominant protestant and other religions here in the us so you have ones that were not which is different than the amish who stayed isolated ones that stay isolated is one thing but ones that will be embedded within a dominant culture and interact with that dominant culture and even get positions in the halls of power [3602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3602.96s)

while being able to maintain fealty to their relationships is that's actually a very interesting study and i will say that none of them i believe are quite adequate you could take the masons as another example right which are quite interesting similarly and i mean the masons mostly after the us was formed so geographic isolation is obviously one factor so what religion we could create [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3634.43s)

on the mars base is one whole kind of question but the ones that geographic proximity is one question which is what types of rituals require physical embodiment and the people to be able to share in that way versus physical isolation which is which ones require not being infiltrated other memes and other people yeah alright obviously doesn't really answer [3661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3661.16s)

the question it just expanded on the question and it's a really interesting topic and we would need some more time yeah i also i quit like a bit weinstein thoughts on i with talisman when we talked about how can we create over nations from from the current from from covert 19 you know we're kind of going through a few of the kind of like factors that make religions great and [3690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3690.42s)

we're trying to kind of like see whether you can kind of like almost like modulate movement according to those but the problem is that you know like they're really really hard to come back fake you know like many of the things that make them work are kind of like because we've intrinsically buy into them it's really hard to engineer movement that has the same properties [3709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3709.92s)

even the phrasing of can we utilize or hijack that set of dispositions in the brain for some useful purpose isn't what gives rise to the experience that people have devotion to right like there is an actual experience of belonging and experience of aspiration to ethics and numinous experience that is an actual trends and mental operator as opposed to simply an omniscient operator thinking [3739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3739.319s)

about a transcendental operator so it's a it's a different thing someone doesn't have to have sloppy metaphysics to be able to understand phenomenology mohammed probably was less muslim than why became four generations later because they were raised in it from where he on so their phenomenology is more entangled with the system than whoever designed the system enrolled [3770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3770.91s)

right so we could be the designers if not the faithful i think it's very interesting to explore religions that emerge from authentic depth of insight and experience that weren't seeking to be religions and yet the depth of experience and insight about the human condition was meaningful enough and compelling enough that it had some [3801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3801.75s)

organic growth versus ones that were intended to gain power oftentimes for political purposes and that were thinking about how to hijack different kinds of groupthink and belonging and superstition and the different dispositions that those things will take i think is also another very interesting angry all right thank you we're gonna give a few and make the chance for a few [3822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3822.45s)

other participants that asking questions sas had another question stop on with you hi yep yeah i just wondering so daniel talks a lot about how you should think about the problem in depth to make sure that you don't weiss implements in solution you don't cause other externalities is there is there like a like a balance to be had between between [3851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3851.07s)

how much time you spend thinking about a problem versus implementing because for example you can spend your whole life thinking about something to try to implements a perfect solution to it but then in the end you obvious as effective as if you maybe implements a partial partial solution then kind of figure things out along the way yeah so sometimes the only way to actually [3874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3874.73s)

figure out what the externalities are is to start to experiment or to figure out how it works is to start to experiment and but the key is do i need to do safe to fail probes and safe to fail type experimental environments and it's gonna depend upon the degree of consequential ities like what is the externality consequence of this thing and what type of i'll tell you how i think about it [3903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3903.06s)

it's what is the complexity in terms of like total number order of magnitude of interactions of the situation we're trying to interact with so let's say i'm looking at doing some biotech thing in humans there's going to be a lot more little complexity of biological interactions that can occur than if i'm trying to change something in a computer chip and so i think about how many what [3928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3928.5s)

how many orders of magnitude of interactions are here and what how many orders of magnitude if i considered so that's one thing i'll think about is the the phase space of likely interactions relative to what i've thought about and if that's even within rough powers of 10 i'm at least thinking about it then i think about as best i can what are the consequences at least that [3952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3952.71s)

are in the second order and maybe some bit of the third order said that i can think about and the more consequential those are also the better we want to have thought about it and the more we want to roll it out in a progressive process so if i'm thinking about oh i just created some self-replicating synthetic biology let's release it in the backyard and see what happens [3976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=3976.05s)

that's a dumb idea right because the ai i don't know what the externalities are gonna be and it could be that i just released great green goo and it kills everything do i release it in a certain kind of bsl-4 laboratory environment to be able to witness what's happening right like that would be the the let's actually find out what it does because we can't just think about it we have to [4001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4001.88s)

experiment and get into the medium itself now if i'm looking at a hybridized crop where i just bread a couple crops together the total amount of genetic change on that compared to a genetically modified crop versus synthetic biology are gonna have me want to do different degrees of safety analysis so like when i think about with kovat and drugs that could help if we [4023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4023.18s)

take a drug that's been around for a really long time like hydroxychloroquine or methylene blue or ivermectin or whatever drugs that we've had for 50 or 70 years and used in millions of people and have a huge amount of long-term safety data on and now i'm just looking at are they effective i'm doing efficacy studies i might be willing to expedite to speed up that research more than a [4050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4050.18s)

new drug that we don't have long term safety data on because i might say oh well it didn't cause any major consequences in the two months i did the trial but it's because it's but it might be causing consequences that have delayed biological reactions to show up a year two years later so if i already have long term data on safety i can do faster [4069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4069.559s)

stuff on efficacy so i'm much more willing as from a policy perspective to expedite fda authorization on long term existing drugs than new ones and i'm also more willing to expedite drugs than vaccines because the like a small molecule drug isn't intended to have an enduring effect whereas a vaccine is actually intended to modulate the th1 th2 systems for years or decades or [4095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4095.809s)

permanently and so long-term safety studies are actually more important and something that i'm anticipating will have a longer-term effect so that's an example of like based on how much we already know that's adjacent and what basis for concern about risk is there what degree of appropriate research would need to come in place um i think that brings you back to like one [4123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4123.38s)

question that i think we almost at the beginning of this which is you know given the incredible really failure of response that we've seen i think in the us and you know can be how do you best make sense of that do you think that is just gaining confidence or do you think that there's like some something something more under the hood that many of us you know like maybe don't don't [4150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4150.14s)

like to see it do i think that everyone who is in a position of influence has maximally good motives and that any lack of effectiveness is simply a result of incompetence i think that's just silly when you frame it that way right do i think that every major politician and different countries that are worrying over power grabs and [4188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4188.349s)

everyone working in who would benefit from surveillance tech and who would benefit from a collapse of the economy do i think that all the people who have major influence and could influence institutional response really just want to save all the lives they can make everything as good as they can keep the market from crashing and you know keep all the jobs intact and the only reason [4210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4210.73s)

we didn't do a better job is just incompetence i think that's just silly i think that we have people who are in positions supposedly on behalf of some larger thing but there is a conflict of interest where it's actually on behalf of whatever their personal interests are and they're advancing those agendas now does that mean there is one coordinated cabal conspiracy at the top no it means [4235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4235.57s)

that there is a decentralized a set of opportunistic power grab incentives combined with having to do enough towards the thing they're supposed to do that they don't get kicked out of their position and do i think that there's an even distribution on how sociopathic everyone is no there's this is probably a gaussian distribution on that but no i think [4260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4260.74s)

saying that you know obviously very few people needed to die from kovat had we been paying attention in december and early january and doing effective responses and we didn't need to the whole economy in the [[food supply]] chains that need to get damaged did all those things happen just because all of the [[nation state|nation states]] are super bureaucratic and and the decision-making processes are [4286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4286.3s)

slow no that's not the only reason alright thanks i don't know whether you read by and robin hanson came out with this post a while ago on group a and group b alliances slowly and basically making a point that um after this the economic world order will be largely defined by those people that by those countries that have got together and control and those you [4311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4311.489s)

wow the key lies in and thank you even see that between houses so currently that right i'm back me we didn't hear me oh okay that's fine well i was just gonna say there's a really interesting article by robin hanson where he's basically talking about group a and [4380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4380.61s)

group b alliances and they're currently like on a geopolitical scale this is kind of shifting in the sense where and many countries that were previously group and a lines or countries that were kind of like more high up in the like geopolitical order are kind of like moving down because they're not really not getting their act together and the u.s. may also moving to into a group b [4399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4399.57s)

alliance for which it may not be safe enough to be in kind of let's say the group a alliance which can have flow of labor and flow of goods amongst themselves and if that so happen and i see that kind of like on a on a local level where you know if you have different parts of people that all have different safety standards and somewhat more and keeping their together and [4419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4419.43s)

it's working really well um you know that trans isn't transitive and in the sense that um you know you you you they're there certain performing and they're not all kind of like interacting well together and i'm wondering on on a global level if if the same holds true in the sense that there will be kind of like fizzle which you know will trade more with each [4445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4445.05s)

other and in which perhaps like a lot of employers will move and and will kind of entice their employees to move into and that won't be the same parts in which they have previously been living but what that may mean on a geopolitical level i mean we see a lot of alliance shifting already right we see the italy's curve finally starting to flatten was wind china came in and gave [4471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4471.69s)

it a bunch of aid which included surveillance drones and other things so and you see eu and eu adjacent countries thinking that he would support them in didn't and then getting chinese support or a few cases some other types of support so massive alliance shifting we see even within the us the groups of states that are clustering so the the california oregon washington com [4498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4498.36s)

flex and the seven state complex around new york and i really feel that the u.s. getting its together and being able to help lead alliance efforts is pretty critical and will make a big difference to the way the world plays out and because even though i can't say the u.s. is actually a republic it at least it at least has that vague idea of having some values or ideals around a republic or [4527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4527.52s)

around democracy whereas when we look at china and we look at russia and we look at saudi arabia and we look at iran and most of the other power players they don't even this like autocracy is really fully embraced and i don't think [[exponential tech]] empowered autocracy is a world we want to go towards and i think that if those are the players that are offering aid to the rest of the [4552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4552.36s)

world and the us isn't because the u.s. is so internally fighting over its own power because it has and this is how big empires die right and democracies make it two to three hundred years and we're almost at 250 years there's so much power here that you have so much internal infighting to see who gets that power that you just kind of lose awareness on what's actually happening [4572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4572.969s)

in the world and that you're losing relative position to it and it's not that i want the u.s. is positioned relative to the world to be something in particular but i think that its ability to help participate with alliance efforts for the values of roughly democratic type western civilization values having a place i think is super important and it's one of the things [4595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4595.53s)

that i most want to see people engaged in is efforts that decrease internal by partisan warfare and create more a more effective national governance that can then do international alliance building better thank you okay we have two more questions from luke nozick and from josh about you coming to meet you so daniel you had yet said i'm not certified to miss her - i think it's [4633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4633.3s)

comments something about empowering people or distributing power and and then you recently alluded to republic or democracy in these things being good um can you be more specific about what the the the problem is with power and who should yeah who should actually organize it so that we could do things effectively like do international treats because it doesn't seem like you know [4667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4667.2s)

warring parties in a democracy is send somebody i'm doing it that's very obvious but what do you specifically believe about how to organize power we should have it and so that you can effectively have a big question um could go in a bunch of directions do you mean like do i think moving towards a positive global singleton is what we should aim for or is there some kind of [4697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4697.11s)

future of democracy that we should aim for or like how do we make america better currently and obviously when we talk about power there's power in the markets which is achieved a certain way power in the state power and religion and culture yeah i i would like to be able to address where the question what you're interested in better can't hear you currently i think allison [4728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4728.75s)

you have to unmute him i mean music you're unmuted for half a second i muted there we go there you go again i'd like you to be as idealistic as possible so none of this triage you know or incrementalism stuff just what do you think is possible for for humans in an ideal state i'm not trying to get a sense of looking at what your ideal you [4764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4764.349s)

know political or social organization is i've got it and actually think all of those different realms are quite important because they there's they're sort of orthogonal ways of looking at at the whole thing some some governments can be structures that it's there's there's one that's autocratic over the other ones but many times we have them overlapping in empowering that religious [4793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4793.929s)

power concurrent with you the catholic church and yet all the kings in the in the middle ages concurring forget the witness system yeah i think the distribution of power between those different types of institutions was actually a problematic and important and because early became progressively more problematic but like when you think about in the u.s. the separation of the [4825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4825.159s)

state and the market why we didn't just have a pure libertarian model we had the idea of a kind of [[liberal democracy]] but also the separation of a state and a church then we say [[liberal democracy]] and kind of leave the role of the church out and mostly focus on market and and state and yet interestingly you read all of the founding father comments about the need for people to have some kind of [4852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4852.61s)

moral education as well as a you know formal civic education for anything like democratic process to work the way i think about that and i'll mention the longer term one the way i think about that briefly is the reason that a state was put in place in this in the kind of us experiment was it was seen that markets could solve most problems or solve a lot of the [4882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4882.89s)

problems in terms of innovation and efficiency but that they also would lead to organized crime and they would lead to tragedy of the commons and different types of places where it was incentivized to do things it really created a shitty quality of life for everyone so there was an idea that there was to be a state that had some kind of ability to regulate the most predatory [4905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4905.8s)

aspects of markets and so there was this idea of law and a monopoly of violence to be able to institute law that was based on jurisprudence which is based on ethics and which is why the founding documents are kind of existential ethical documents and that's actually where the role of the church came in which was we didn't want a single church having dominion over that but the idea [4930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4930.65s)

that there was phyllis ah the church and the academy and that there were deep considerations of what is a good life that is informing ethics it's informing jurisprudence it's informing law to be able to bind the predatory aspects of markets will facilitate the helpful aspects of markets simultaneously and kind of the way i see it is that the markets the predatory aspects were [4953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4953.69s)

designed to be bound by the state but the state was designed to be bound by a educated and engaged populace and where the state was of foreign by the people and otherwise you get the watchdog issue where you have maximum incentive for the market forces to capture the regulatory forces and then just get crony capitalism but in order for and then the people are actually bound by the market [4979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=4979.16s)

which means accounting that they can't ask for rights they aren't willing to take responsibilities for and they can't you know implement where the where the accounting doesn't work out and if you kind of think of that there's a really nice balance in it but it's easy to see how a symmetries of power emerged where even though there's aggregate symmetry between supply side and demands [5000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5000.72s)

there's more coordination on supply-side than there is undemanding asymmetric information warfare's that lead to a less educated ant+ just natural human weakness at scale that lead to the population not checking the government and then the state force the market forces capturing it so i think there's some stuff that can be done to actually reverse this [5025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5025.8s)

[[institutional decay]] and make a better version of this thing and i'm actually very interested in that i don't think it meets the sufficiency criteria long term and so then the question of what is a more visionary long term distribution of power and choice making look like i can say that i don't know because we haven't implemented it and the ideas that i have about it i don't know if will work but i [5052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5052.11s)

hit i have thoughts on this topic that have to do with one of the ways that i frame it up if you think about if you think about kind of jeffery west's analysis and scale and the correspondence of that with kind of dunbar society limits and the idea that in general intended groups of people whether they're companies or countries get diminishing [[collective intelligence]] and productive capacity at scale beyond give or take in evolutionary tribal size then that ends up creating a basis for smaller groups to be more intelligent relative to the larger group and you both have an incentive for defection and the capacity to defect and get away with it because the larger group becomes stupider and can't do the appropriate accounting so you end up getting niches [5108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5108.239s)

for sociopathic predatory behavior on this system whereas if you had linear development or super linear development of [[collective intelligence]] as a function of scale as you go above [[dunbar number]] you could have the group be smart enough to actually notice and bind the sociopathic defections where everyone would do better by being by participating with the [[collective intelligence]] system and defecting against it now exactly how do we instantiate that i again i think that goes it's conversation i would love to have a conversation i'd love to have with you that takes a much longer chunk of time okay i realize the line of questions is just starting to ramp up music then you would be able to say for one [5163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5163.31s)

more question then we headed out sure yeah okay yeah sure maybe you do one more question and then maybe luke and daniel i can convince both of you to come on and talk it out on the next one together okay yes sir i'll search for you yes okay i'm me to you now thank you good evening thank you daniel this was amazing it was [5196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5196.13s)

a very right range i think that the how to find the best system question seems to come down to something that might be eventually contradictory like how can we combine the benefits of competent totalitarianism with the robustness and self-actualization and non-violence of a well entrenched democracy and it's a on top of a very diverse and tourist population and society and cultural [5225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5225.719s)

traditions that's so that is a super difficult question and probably won't be able to solve it tonight so a very simple question maybe in the end what would happen if you take the present situation where the fda is blocking testing and together with the cdc and some other institutions more or less directly responsible for the deaths of something like loss of 90,000 americans [5247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5247.7s)

and with an x f website and how can we solve that in the situation consequent walking the fda what would happen if california for instance works the fda and the federal agencies will look very firmly at us but at the moment the situation seems to be a weakness of the federal government that would allow ago she ate the destitution between federal and local power and create [5277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5277.469s)

- segments yeah i i will also say i don't know the answer to this would need to look in it more depth but a few thoughts that come to mind i think states can do totally up stuff and have people who are very power seeking at the level states even at the level of cities but they don't have like states don't have nukes [5303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5303.159s)

even though nukes might live in a state the federal government does they don't states have a national guard but they don't have weapons of mass destruction and they don't have the same types of massive power consolidation so i think the tenth amendment is very important and i think the movements to an increased tim's like when we talk about things that could get worse or better [5324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5324.88s)

right now in the us the idea that states become more relevant is actually a possibly very good idea whit while having the factor for right and left states moving in further apart directions and increased tension between them so we we have to factor for that but that's mostly engineered that's mostly narrative or fair engineered and could be addressed but i do think taking [5347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5347.65s)

it beyond the state down to the city level is better because cities are real things and states are fictions just like [[nation state|nation states]] are fictions like where the boundary is is we've determined in a war or a trade or whatever but cities are based on the actual goods and services and transportation dynamics that need to be within a particular space of each other so i think and this [5371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5371.05s)

is what jeffrey west was showing and scale was that cities actually do have productive capacity that can be linear or super linear as a function of population so i think having more governance at the level of cities is very interesting and then having coalition's of cities network [[network dynamics]] between cities cities and the surrounding metropolitan areas pretty [5394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5394.0s)

much defined by transportation dynamics and there are obviously also tricky things we're like let's say we're dealing with a pandemic where let's say an area closes off its border and figures out how to become a green zone but the other areas adjacent to it don't well it doesn't actually get to reopen its border and re-issue life without the other areas doing that or you know one [5420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5420.159s)

person can cause the infections again so this is a place where the rights of individual places and their responsibilities to each other are just so profoundly connected which is why this is such a big deal i think one i think there's some stuff that's up about the way tests have been blocked and rolled out i think i think there's a lot about it but i also think that [5443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5443.03s)

there's a lot that's really bad about the tests like i don't think the immunoassays are useful for tests and trace or really diagnosis for suppression at all there it takes too many days from the time you were exposed and are infectious for the antibodies to show up and the even even if you have one that had very low false negatives at that point and then there's too much [5467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5467.96s)

that isn't known about what the antibodies actually mean yet or how long they last or the decay rate on them or any of those things so i think we would need high sensitivity pcr that could be very very widely utilized to be able to have testing really become very meaningful as a suppression strategy and so we're not waiting for antibody response in the blood we're being able [5492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5492.59s)

to detect presence of the virus in the mucosa so you know nasal and oral swabs and i think i think we could roll out specific areas could roll out those types of diagnostics and be able to show the effectiveness of it mostly commercially and with local governments participation and i think if it showed enough effectiveness so like we're talking with [5518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5518.54s)

some people in las vegas because las vegas is very focused on reopening because they're losing like a billion dollars a week per casino or whatever staying closed so they really want to reopen but vegas by itself reopening could cause the infection to never go in the world because people come from all over touch everything together in a closed air environment it circulated air [5540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5540.74s)

and then fly back to the rest of the world but they also have all the money to actually do the thing properly and the local government gets enough money from them they want to really participate so they could roll out hepa filters and pecco filters and nanotech surface treatments and detection mechanisms and get the security on them right and and point-of-contact rapid [5559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5559.22s)

turnaround pcr diagnostics and actually be able to invest the capital to show the effectiveness to then be able to lower the economies of scale and the questions of if it's true or not to then get them implemented other places so i'm interested in some of those approaches thank you so much for joining today i mean intended so bye bye everyone see you tomorrow thank you daniel [5594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eoB4g3gCmw&t=5594.86s)
