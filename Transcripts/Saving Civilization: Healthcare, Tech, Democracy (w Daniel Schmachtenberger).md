- zubin hey guys, dr. z. welcome to "the zdoggmd show." today, i have a guest i've been wanting to get on forever and ever and ever. you guys know i'm really
interested in the social dilemma, in other words, the
effect that [[social media]] and these exponential crazy technologies that hack our dopamine
centers have had on us, the mental health of children, and so on. a lot of my knowledge on that
comes from our guest today, and his partner, tristan harris, [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=22.347s)

who runs the center for humane technology. daniel schmachtenberger is the founder and director of the consilience project, and he is an expert in the (laughs), the catastrophes that
can end civilizations, and how we might thread that
narrow needle to avoid them. daniel, man, welcome to the show. - daniel it's good to
be here with you, man. happy that we're finally here. - zubin dude, i just saw
you on rogan with tristan, [48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=48.564s)

and i was like, "oh, man,
they're hitting all the buttons "on civilization-level threats," and then i thought, "well,
what are we gonna talk about "when you come on my show?" 'cause you just were on rogan. you've been on lex fridman. you've been all over the place. and then we started
talking before the show, and immediately, i was like, "oh my god, this is a
conversation no one's having," [66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=66.32s)

and it's a, let's start it this way. we have these god-level technologies now that really prey, and i'm talking about
[[social media]] in particular, but there's other
technologies that really prey on our innate brain's addictive capacity, and really hacks it in ways
that are affecting our health not just individually, but the
health of our entire society. maybe that's a good starting point [97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=97.846s)

for jumping into what
you're passionate about, because this is stuff that
you've dedicated your life to kind of studying, how
we can avoid catastrophe. - daniel okay, so you say godlike tech, and if it's not obvious for people, so that it doesn't sound like hyperbole, maybe we just take a moment,
and say what we mean by that. when we have the ability
to do synthetic biology, like actually make life, and the ability for genetic engineering, [124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=124.223s)

crispr, other methods,
to be able to change the fundamental base code of life, [[artificial intelligence]]
that can do calculations that no type of biological
intelligence can do, when we can extinct whole
species, destroy whole ecosystems, build new environments,
where the anthropocene, the human-built environment
is the major force shaping whole parts of the surface of the world, that's not the power of
an [[apex predator]], right? no, like orcas aren't doing all that. [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=151.011s)

(zubin laughs)
- zubin are you sure? i don't know if you've read
"the hitchhiker's guide "to the galaxy," but i believe
dolphins did a lot of damage. - daniel so trying to
model humans as, you know, one of the primate hominids,
and apply [[apex predator]] theory, it just clearly doesn't explain the kind of thing that we are. we've had a curve of
being able to develop tech faster than the environment
can become resilient to the way we use that tech, right? [174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=174.202s)

predators increase, there's
a co-evolutionary process where predators increase
their predatory capacity through mutation at the same rate that the prey is increasing its capacity to avoid the predators. the slower ones get eaten. the faster ones inbreed,
that kind of thing. we were able to increase
our predatory capacity way faster than any animal was able to increase their resilience to it. [190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=190.601s)

so we were able to
overhunt an environment, and then rather have our population check to that environment, we were able to move, and become the [[apex predator]]
in the next environment. polar bears are not apex
predators in the savanna. orcas aren't on land. we went and became apex
spreaders everywhere. we're able to overhunt an environment, and then enslave them
through factory farming, and other things like that. [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=207.314s)

so this really different,
it's a different thing, and- - zubin we're a whole
new genre of being, right, to be able to do that, and is
that, and not to derail you, but is that because we have
the capacity for language, communication across large
groups in flexible ways that, say, bees, or ants don't
have, or orcas don't have? - daniel yeah, there's
a type of abstraction that lends itself towards
the nature of our language, and very specifically towards
the nature of our tech. obviously, we'll see that beavers use, [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=231.331s)

they modify their environment
in a particular way. birds with their nests do. we'll obviously see whether it's birds, or primates' use of
certain kinds of objects in their environment
that we can call a tool, but they're not evolving the way they do that as time goes on. they co-evolved with some
environmental capacity that they found. so a chimp will use a
rock to cut something. [248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=248.292s)

they'll experientially try
one rock versus another, and whichever one they
can tell is cutting better they'll use, but to understand
the abstract principle of sharpness, what does this
one have more than this one to design one that is sharper, is a thing they don't do, right? but it is a thing that
homo habilis started doing, which was how do we actually
start to create stone tools? 'cause we understand the
abstract principle of sharpness, and can make a sharper thing, [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=270.745s)

which is understanding what
all these have in common, but it's actually not any of them. and then, so that process
of what humans were doing that was different started with the beginning of stone tools. obviously, it took a major jump with the agricultural revolution, took a major jump with
the industrial revolution, nuclear, and then obviously with digital. so we find ourselves in
the verticalizing part [288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=288.8s)

of a long exponential curve of power, and you can say now the power of gods, and yet, not necessarily
a corresponding degree of increase in wisdom for
how to use that power, and all of the existential
threats are because of that, because obviously stone
tools, or even agrarian tools, can't destroy the whole world. so [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are always, all the human-induced
[[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are mediated by the level of
technological power we have [313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=313.14s)

that doesn't have adequate wisdom, prudence binding and guiding its use. - zubin so this is a great base to start this discussion from because this idea of all of human history
starting with homo habilis, you said, so this was
one of our progenitors, able to use tools, abstract, and actually understand the concept of potentially of sharpness, and that allows a kind of
recursive improvement in tools [335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=335.506s)

that a chimpanzee, or a primate can't do, because like you said, they're
co-evolving that use of tool with their environment. so they, maybe they notice
experientially, like you said, that this piece of stone
cuts a little better, so they start using it. but they can't de novo go, "oh, it cuts better because of sharpness. "i bet i could design a sharper tool." so we have this really
interesting ability to do that, [356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=356.07s)

and over tens of thousands of years of homo sapiens evolution, it's now reaching a phase,
maybe longer, right, it's now reaching a phase
of [[exponential growth]], because the technology itself is allowing a recursive improvement
in the technology, right? - daniel and so, you know, you were starting to talk about addiction, and kind of the hacking
of dopamine circuits and reward circuits. [379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=379.344s)

and one way to think about
that is that homo sapiens are at least a few hundred thousand years old, and obviously, the hominid
precursors to that are at least a few million years, and all of that genetic evolution was fit for hunter-gatherer environments, right? like we were evolving reward circuits that were relevant for
hunter-gatherer environments. - zubin like what, like sweet taste, or- - daniel yeah, so if we
take the reward circuits [403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=403.37s)

on food, specifically,
fat, salt, and sugar create stronger dopaminergic process
than green cellulosic stuff, and whatever else, right? - zubin and dopamine's
our reward chemical to make it very simple. - daniel feels good, do it again. dopamine-opioid axis, right? - zubin yeah.
- daniel so in an evolutionary environment, you didn't have a lot of
salt, fat, or sugar, right? [425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=425.267s)

the sugar that you had was
only pretty much gonna come from things like fruits
that were gonna be seasonal, and before we hybridized the fruits, the fruits had way more seeds, and way less fruit than
they have now, right, in terms of most- - zubin fiber to sugar content, yeah. - daniel and so, getting
all of that you could that had more caloric density meant that you had a better chance
of making it through a famine, [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=443.192s)

and possibly being able
to feed more people. the same was true with fats, and the same was true with
when you'd find a salt source. and so, there was evolutionary
selective advantage on getting all of those you could. so those who had more reward circuit on those actually did better. once we figured out how
to make all the salt, fat, sugar you want, and be
able to combine them in the ways that maximized
addiction, right, [463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=463.753s)

and remove all the micronutrients, remove all the vitamins and minerals, and just basically all of fast
food is just combining salt, fat, sugar in novel ways with
maximum texture palatability, and to drive maximum
kind of addictive process separated from all the micronutrients. you actually took something that, where the evolutionary reward
was attached to a real thing. now, you have, of course, overweight and obesity being one of the
main causes of health issues, [487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=487.994s)

and yet the reward circuit hasn't changed. and so, you were able to extract the active ingredient from the thing that it was bound to
that was actually useful. and the same is true with porn to sex. the same is true with social
media to tribal friendships. the same is true with
productivity to meaning, right? there's a whole bunch of places, where the sexual impulse historically would have been attached [510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=510.494s)

to that mating opportunity, was bound to you were going
to have children for your, there was all kinds of intimacy and things that were
required to have that happen. just extract the hypernormal
parts, and maximize them, and you get porn.
- zubin ah. - daniel same with
likes on facebook, right? you have no real friend. you don't have authentic intimacy. you don't have authentic trust. [530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=530.972s)

but you have lots of positive
feedback of certain types, which, of course, then is
gonna give you the equivalent of overweight psychologically, which is like narcissism and emptiness. - zubin ooh.
- daniel so you can see that society has been oriented
to hijack reward circuits, be able to extract the active ingredient, double down on that separate from the actual evolutionary
beneficial thing that it was originally for. [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=552.673s)

and that's one of the things is we're not genetically
fit for this environment. we're not genetically
fit for the anthropocene. and yet, we're an adaptive
enough creature, we can adapt, but adapt, the type of creature we become adapting to that environment might not be the type of creature we would choose to be otherwise. - zubin okay, this is
the central foundation of everything we're gonna talk about, [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=575.19s)

because the anthropocene, this age of man, it's so interesting that
man has those capacities and evolves to a point where
it can generate technologies in a society that actually feed
back to its primitive brain in a way that it almost
is compelled to do, like, "oh, wait, so sugar
tastes good, fat tastes good, "salt tastes good." fast food inevitably emerges, because we know, and
especially when you tie it, which we can talk about,
to economic incentives, [599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=599.337s)

and capitalism, et cetera,
that allow a feedback loop that's, oh, you can
actually get, you know, the productivity boost of making money, being secure, et cetera,
from selling stuff that actually really plugs
right into our limbic mind. and now, we have a world
where we have this, you said it on rogan, we
have these paleolithic minds that are in a situation
with this godlike technology that really hacks the
paleolithic mind to a degree. so whether it's fast food, [631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=631.994s)

whether it's social
media, whether it's porn, and porn's something i've
talked about long time ago, but this, it is. it's a decoupling of that
reward dopamine circuit from all the meaning, the relationship, the intrinsic connections that sex meant historically, even when it was less
of that, like you know, there were polyamorous
societies, and all of this. that's all fine, but the truth
is it had more connection [654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=654.543s)

and meaning than it does
when you're surfing porn and masturbating, right? - daniel i mean, let's
just, we won't take too long with this, but- - zubin you can take as
long as you want with porn, because honestly, i could
talk about it all day. - daniel even if you
look at the multi-male, multi-female earlier mating systems that you'd call
polyamorous mating systems, like the ones that "sex
at dawn" talks about, [673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=673.975s)

the mosuo, or the canela
people, or whatever, the modern interpretation of them, oftentimes, the people
who are proponents for it are failing to recognize that they had a completely different [[social system]] that made that adaptive that also included a different economic system, right? so you have multi-male,
multi-female mating, but the whole tribe raised all the kids. - zubin uh-huh.
- daniel the woman wasn't [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=695.621s)

left as a single mom, because
she lived with her family, not with her, not with her primary, not with the partner that inseminated her. all of the fathers, 'cause there was low paternity certainty, all of the fathers were
contributing to all of the kids. you actually didn't have a primarily private property based system, but commons based system.
- zubin uh-huh. - daniel so you can't
extract that one part [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=716.64s)

from the whole rest of it
and have it work, right? so obviously, that system
could only be adaptive within that context. this was actually a very
interesting conversation bret weinstein and i had
many, many years ago, 'cause a lot of his evolutionary
theory background was primate mating systems, and-
- zubin oh, wow. - daniel and he was-
- zubin monkey sex. - daniel arguing for why institutional monogamy did
some really important things [741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=741.201s)

that a lot of people didn't understand where the sexual revolution
really damaged it, and i don't wanna put the
wrong words in bret's mouth. i'm gonna share kind
of how i understand it that was inspired by that
conversation with him. he might hold this with more nuance, but it was, it actually
upgraded my thinking on it. he said if you think
about what institutional, like when you think about
what we call civilization, to be civilized is kind
of a domestication program [764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=764.289s)

for wild humans to be
able to operate together at larger than tribal scale-
- zubin yeah, makes sense. - daniel and for hundreds
of thousands of years, we never got tribes bigger
than about 150 people. they stayed at very small scales, where everybody knew everybody, so that the sacrifices you made for others were non-anonymous people. they were people that
you knew really well, and that you wouldn't do
that at much larger sizes. [781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=781.654s)

and so, then the much larger thing, the thing we call civilization, can also be thought of as
a domestication program. - zubin huh.
- daniel and the main things you have to domesticate out of people that make them not work other well have to do with sex and violence. and so, this is also where most of the psychological shadow comes, and it's why the intersection of sex [798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=798.804s)

and violence is the deepest part of most people's psychological shadow. - zubin oh. - daniel they're kind of
put into the same areas. but if you think about what
institutional monogamy occurring with that context, one of the
things that it was designed, or a few of the things
it's designed to do, if you couldn't have sex
until getting married, and then you weren't allowed to divorce, and that was actually held, [821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=821.597s)

and of course, no system
will be perfectly held, but like just the idea,
then in order to get laid, a guy had to get a girl's parents, and preacher, and community to decide that he was an acceptable
husband and father. - zubin hmm. - daniel and that, and
the binding of his ability to get laid to his ability
to be a good father long-term meant that there was an incentive for him to actually be
a good guy long-term, [845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=845.529s)

which meant who, him being
a good guy for civilization and him being a good guy
as a father were bound to his need to get laid, right? and that there was a vetting beyond her, who might have already
got oxytocin to not be, you know, assessing him
well, 'cause of the crush that the father, and the mother, and the whatever would
also be helping to assess, to grant the right to do the thing. and then in the wedding
ceremony, does anyone object? [868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=868.7s)

if he had been an asshole to other people, and they got to bring that up, so he has to be an asshole to nobody, otherwise, he's never gonna be laid. then this would also be even
where the slut-shaming came, which is such a terrible
thing in our modern context, but i was coming to understand where a possible evolutionary
relevance of it was- - zubin yeah, yeah.
- daniel was that if any women would start
to have sex with guys [887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=887.536s)

outside of the marriage context, which would mean that
assholes could get laid, it creates an evolutionary
niche for assholes to actually be able to make it, and then those guys figure
out how to get more women to do that thing, and so, the idea was
almost like herd immunity. the idea was a collectivist idea. you actually have to close the niche for assholes comprehensively. [906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=906.122s)

if you want a civilization to go well, guys are going to do what
they need to do to get laid. so if you bind the opportunity to get laid to being a good citizen with
multiple people vetting it, that's a good system. it's actually interesting, right? like most people, myself included, who kind of grew up in a
more post-sexual revolution, liberated idea, thought of that
as just oppressive nonsense. - zubin right.
- daniel and then i'm like, [929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=929.536s)

"oh, that's actually interesting." so then the idea was
that with birth control, you kind of have a sexual revolution. it seems like it's liberating
for women in particular, because you decouple sex and reproduction for the first time. - zubin right.
- daniel where historically you could never really decouple
sex and reproduction well, which is also why that was
gonna inexorably affect her biology more than his, [948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=948.365s)

because he could possibly get laid, have a genetic benefit to do
so, and have no consequence, and she could not have no consequence. it'd be a life or death
possible thing for her, right? and so, of course she'll
have higher criteria and more bonding biologically oriented, which makes perfect sense
that it should be that way. but then she's able to kind of let that go and be a liberated modern person because of the birth control pill, [968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=968.743s)

but her evolutionary
biology hasn't changed. again, just like i can't eat
all of the chocolate cake that i want and not get fat
just cause i want to, right? the biology is the way that it is- - zubin the biology's still there- - daniel i don't get to just
separate the reward circuit. - zubin right.
- daniel and so, then the idea that after that there was more of an evolutionary niche where assholes could get
well-laid as a result of that, [985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=985.63s)

and that that actually has
a culture-damaging property. so if you wanna go the
convention of marriage, if you wanna not drop to
pre-conventional developmentally meaning more selfish than the convention, but go to truly post-conventional, the post-conventional has to be, okay, well, how do i have, how
do the individuals have more freedom than the
institution of marriage to make that choice while
still paying attention and not creating niches for bad behavior [1008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1008.689s)

to be able to propagate? just an interesting topic. - zubin you know, it's (laughs), man, i didn't think we'd be talking about that, but it's fascinating, and you
know what's really interesting about it is it binds this idea that you have this particular hardware, this biology that's evolved over however many millions of hundreds and millions of years, but
then you have the software [1027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1027.145s)

of the world that feeds back onto it, and emerges from it. so the particular constraints
of the hardware may create a social dynamic where,
again, guys have to be good, they are vetted by the family, wait 'til marriage to get
laid, reduce asshole agenesis, and that helps civilization, and helps the short-term marriage. and so, that dynamic feeding
back with the biology creates the emergent civilization. [1054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1054.97s)

now, we're in a situation where we've, and like you said, a good
example of birth control, and again, neither one of us is saying, "oh, dude, get rid of birth control, "go back to a dowry," right? no, we're saying the environment and the hardware actually interact, and we better be aware
of how that happens, because now it's happening in a way that may not lead to a civilization [1074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1074.295s)

that we want collectively. - daniel yeah, i mean, you've addressed the thesis-antithesis issue, and kind of the distinct moral intuitions that cluster more on the
right and more on the left. and if you were to try to
make a dialectic like that, like say traditional and progressive, or conservative/traditional
and progressive, innovative, one way of framing, there's
lots of ways of framing this. there's problems with all
the things i'm gonna say, [1104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1104.367s)

'cause i'm, but one way of framing the- - zubin models are limited, yeah. - daniel the conservative,
or traditional intuition is the idea that if there's a [[social system]] that made it through the
trials of evolutionary history, and there's lots of them that failed, it probably has a lot of embedded
wisdom that isn't obvious. it probably made it through for a reason. so go back to the old, keep the old thing, whether it's the founding
fathers, or christianity, [1127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1127.017s)

or whatever the thing is, right, that you're trying to conserve, that there might be reasons why it worked that we don't even understand well, but that were, that it was tested, and you know, tried and true, and so- - zubin proof is in the pudding- - daniel of that.
- zubin yes, yes. - daniel the progressive intuition is we're facing novel situations
that we never faced, [1142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1142.424s)

and that the things
that worked in the past couldn't possibly work for
that, and innovation is needed. these are obviously both true,
and need to be in dialectic. so the idea that either
of those would be adequate is nonsense, 'cause if
the new thing you're doing doesn't factor that most
of the environment is still the same and the things
that worked might work for reasons you don't know, and you throw the traditional
thing out too fast, then realize it was doing
things you didn't realize, [1162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1162.113s)

and you just fucked up-
- zubin yeah. - daniel right, so the
progressive often doesn't pay enough attention to
the traditional impulse, and vice versa. - zubin 1,000%, and the
way that's intuitively felt by people who i think, a lot
of people in my audience, and we use this term alt-middle, because it's kind of a meme-y phrase, but it's really not quite right. it's a parody of
alt-right, and it's saying, [1180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1180.885s)

"hey, no, we're actually looking
for a synthesis position." we're saying, "oh, there's
actually a higher order thinking "and complexity that's needed
to integrate the two sides," because each side on its own is missing a big piece of the complexity. so how do we integrate that? and again, to have that
standpoint actually, or at least have it aspirationally, means inhabiting each side, right? and again, i promise we'll
get back to the anthropocene [1206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1206.621s)

and how we, how the
technology, and all that. but to be able to inhabit
each side is necessary to emerge the thesis. otherwise, you know, we're stuck in this left-right sort of dichotomy, or a thesis, antithesis,
or whatever subject you're talking about,
where you have two sides, or more than two sides. - daniel there's a guy i know
from the integral community, clint fuhs, who did a doctoral thesis [1229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1229.247s)

that i found really interesting
several years ago on this, in the field of developmental psychology what are higher stages of development, meaning people who can
process more complexity with more nuance, and what are the things that correlate with that the most. and for a long time,
there had been this idea that perspective-taking was the key to the correlation of that. people with kind of higher
stages of hierarchical complexity [1253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1253.311s)

could take more different perspectives, and the kind of nuance, if
i'm understanding rightly what his work added,
was it was actually not perspective-taking as much
as perspective-seeking. it was actually an impetus
to seek the perspectives, not simply the capacity to
take them without doing it. - zubin oh, interesting. - daniel and so- - zubin intention, drive, motivation to actually see another's perspective. [1274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1274.074s)

- daniel and so, it's
interesting to think that the thing that would
be the [[generator function]] of complexity of thought the most is the innate impulse to try to understand where people are coming from, and be able to see their worldview, and then be able to run
parallax across lots of those. so perspective-seeking,
then perspective-taking, then perspective analysis,
can i error correct them, then perspective synthesis. [1296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1296.062s)

- zubin okay, so that's the process. you know, it's interesting, because i find that one of the biggest rushes i get is when somebody that i disagree
with explains their position to me in a way that i deeply inhabit it, like i'm like, "oh my gosh!" that's like a, it's like
a dopamine rush in itself, like, "i understand, okay." now, i can actually, and i actually have that
desire to understand it. [1316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1316.537s)

but there are some spaces
where i'm much more closed off to understanding other perspectives, like if i'm having an argument
with, you know, a friend, or something else,
there's more of a block. so it's not a one-size-fits-all, but in general, i think that
that intention, that desire, that sort of little internal reward from getting to inhabit
another perspective, in other words, the
possibility of it leads to the intention to some degree. [1340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1340.255s)

- daniel okay, you
just mentioned something that i think is real interesting, and we'll go back to
where we were earlier, which is you said you get
a bit of a dopamine hit from understanding the view of someone that you hadn't previously understood, where kind of the world opens up, something makes more sense. there's like a reward circuit on increased clarity, or insight. [1358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1358.239s)

the thing i would bring up here is that not all reward circuits
are equally healthy, right? there are hijacked reward circuits that are mostly entropic, and then there are reward circuits that are mostly healthier, syntropic. - zubin so entropic
meaning leading to disorder- - daniel mostly degrade the system. - zubin degrade the system. - daniel and so, basically,
everything in the direction [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1376.874s)

of addiction is kind of
entropic reward circuit, or a kind of downgrading reward circuit, and almost all of the
upgrading reward circuits don't provide a easy spike of reward. they require some work,
and then reward occurs, and this is the one marshmallow,
two marshmallow thing. - zubin mmm-hmm, explain that for folks. - daniel very, very,
very famous, classic, many times repeated study. there's a lot of interesting
nuance on the study, [1404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1404.903s)

but basically, you put kids in a room, and the study is set up. they get one, there's a
marshmallow on the table. the researcher sets a clock
for some amount of time, like 15 minutes, says, "if
you wanna eat this marshmallow "at any time you can, "but then you only get
that one marshmallow. "if you wait the whole 15
minutes, and you don't eat it, "when i come back, i'll
give you two marshmallows." well, first, assessing they'd rather have [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1426.683s)

two marshmallows than one. so it's a impulse, a delayed impulse and impulse control kind of study. and it was found that the kids that ate, could wait and got two
marshmallows succeeded more at almost all areas of life. the one-marshmallow kids
had higher incarceration, did less well on their
sats, had more divorce rate, like all kinds of things, and that you could assess this
starting at like age five. [1447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1447.403s)

and so, it was pretty, almost bothersomely deterministic- - zubin right.
- daniel about how successful people would be based on delayed gratification. can i avoid immediate gratification associated with long-term goals? 'cause then, it was basically
an assessment of capacity for long-term orientation.
- zubin hmm. - daniel and intentionality. [1467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1467.088s)

and so, there are two different
reward circuits, right? there's two different relationships to the nature of that reward circuit. and so, as you were mentioning, you can hear a point of
view that you disagree with, where at first, you might
actually feel more uncomfortable. - zubin yeah.
- daniel you might actually be squirming in your seat, like, "fuck, maybe i'm
wrong about everything." - zubin which is the worst
feeling (laughs), right? [1486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1486.611s)

- daniel and then you're like, "oh, wow, "i learned something,"
and it's very much like the reward circuit of exercising. like at first, exercise
doesn't give you the hit that just eating the chocolate
cake in the moment does. i get an instant hit of increased pleasure from the chocolate cake-
- zubin yeah. - daniel whereas with working out, like i'm sweating, and it's painful, and my muscles hurt, and whatever, [1505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1505.283s)

but the baseline of how
good i feel in my body as i keep doing that over time goes up. as i keep eating the
chocolate cake regularly, my baseline goes down as i'm
getting more inflammation, and obesity, and those
types of things, right? so the chocolate cake
reward circuit gives me an immediate spike and then a drop, and then the drop says now
that i'm low blood sugar, 'cause the insulin overcompensated, now i'm craving more sugar. [1524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1524.871s)

as that keeps going, my baseline erodes. - zubin it's a downward
spiral into entropy, yeah. - daniel with exercise,
it's the other one. the same is true, 'cause
what you just said is when you listen to the point of view you disagree with long enough and earnestly enough
that you understand it, you get a reward on the other side, but the reward actually
increased the complexity and the accuracy of your thinking. [1542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1542.469s)

there's a reward circuit
on the chocolate cake side of this one, which is the reward
circuit on quick certainty. - zubin being right.
- daniel yeah. certainty and sanctimony, and obviously, this is what
our information environment is optimized towards right now. the facebook news feed
is gonna show things to people that will
maximize their engagement and their stickiness. and most people, if you put a very long, [1566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1566.057s)

nuanced research paper in front of them that has views that they don't agree with, they're just gonna bounce.
- zubin yeah. - daniel they're only
gonna stay engaged, because it makes them feel right, or pisses them off, or scares them. it does some kind of limbic hijack, and also in a short amount of bits, 'cause their attention span is bad, and the short amount of
bits means inherently [1584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1584.235s)

it won't be complex, or nuanced. - zubin so i, okay, man, so much here. i don't know how you
managed to tie it all back to [[social media]] and addiction, but i'm gonna give you kudos for that as somebody who does interviews (laughs), 'cause i was like, "how
are we ever gonna, ah." so a couple things you
said, limbic hijack. i just wanna let people know hijacking our lower
sort of brain functions [1601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1601.911s)

of that primitive paleolithic mind that is susceptible to that,
that dopamine addiction. the addiction circuits
are there, et cetera. and the idea that there's
two sides of that, and actually, this is a good
idea to introduce this term of hormesis, which you and i
were talking about offline, the idea that you have
this addiction circuit where you get a reward, but
then you drop to a baseline that's below the original baseline, and then it's a downward spiral, [1627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1627.618s)

versus hormesis, which
is more like exercise. can you explain hormesis?
- daniel yeah. and i just wanna say, because
you have an educated audience, we're simplifying
everything for model purpose and speed purpose. obviously, it's not just dopamine, right? you can have a limbic hijack that is more around fear, or outrage, and it's epinephrine, and
adrenaline, and cortisol, but it is also gonna create a certain kind [1651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1651.354s)

of motivational process. and so, when we say
dopamine reward circuit, we're really simplifying some kind of quick motivational neurochemistry. - zubin 1,000%, and
even the neurochemistry, there's even epiphenomenon
around neurochemicals, and glial cells, and all of that, yeah. so we're making, yeah, again,
all the models are models. - daniel useful to start
to help understand the thing, and then don't idolize 'em.
- zubin yes. [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1679.287s)

- daniel okay, hormesis, so the idea with exercise
that if you're moving an amount of weight that
is really, really easy, you're probably not gonna
get that much muscle growth, because there's no reason
for a bunch of muscle growth. muscle growth, like you're
gonna have to be able to consume more food to
support those muscles. there's energy involved
in the anabolism there. so the body's only gonna
do it if it has to, and it has to because you're
stressing its current capacity. [1702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1702.588s)

so it's when you are at the
edge of your adaptive capacity that the system says, "oh,
we might actually not be safe "if we don't increase adaptive capacity, "'cause we're having
to engage in situations "that need all of the
capacity we currently have. "let's generate more," right? so hormesis is the property
of systems to upregulate their capacity and response to stress that is near the boundary
of what they can handle. and exercise is a classic example, [1725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1725.209s)

but that's why you do hot-cold therapy is, one of the reasons for hot-cold therapy is you're creating a kind
of metabolic hormesis, and as you're exposing
yourself to more variance of temperature, the
body actually regulates. it has an impetus to
regulate its own temperature, which means more kind of
metabolic flexibility. but hormesis in general, like the two-marshmallow
reward circuits are usually more hormetic, right? [1748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1748.147s)

they usually involve stressing
your current capacity, and then you get a reward on new capacity. but obviously, the
addictive things generally don't require you stressing your capacity. they give you some kind of hit within the current capacity limits, and usually in ways that
downgrade the capacity levels- - zubin overall, yeah. - daniel so there's
a cognitive hormesis. there's an emotional hormesis. [1768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1768.585s)

there's spiritual hormesis, right? so the cognitive hormesis, like if weightlifting, or
sprinting, or whatever it is, is gonna be like a physiological hormesis, the cognitive one is you're going to feel some kind of stress, pain associated with being at the edge
of your attention span. like if i'm reading text,
and my mind's wandering, it's the ability to keep fucking focusing my mind on purpose. [1791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1791.026s)

it is growing attention span
as a, like a muscular capacity. - zubin yeah.
- daniel but i don't get it if i'm not actually working at it, and if i'm not at the
limit of my attention, i'm not gonna grow my attention- - zubin it won't push, yeah. it won't push through. so this idea that in a way, when we're seeking other opinions, or we're trying to use
an integral perspective, [1808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1808.361s)

an alt-middle perspective,
to try to synthesize, we're pushing ourselves
through a discomfort, not to the point of failure,
where we've injured the system, but to the point where the system goes, "wait, humans are anti-fragile," which we'll probably talk
about, where that kind of stress actually does create that hormetic effect, where the system then responds
by getting more capacity. - daniel and then there's
a reward circuit on that that is fundamentally a
healthier, more aligned one, [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1833.924s)

both healthier for the being,
and healthier for the way that being can relate with the world. - zubin exactly, so it's
actually a virtuous reward system as opposed to the addictive reward system. so how then, now we have
this human mind that's, you know, paleolithic, and
it's now put in a world where we have a different technology that is relying on reward circuits that maybe are not as
virtuous as we would like. is that where we are now
in this conversation? [1859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1859.063s)

- daniel i would argue that capitalism can exploit
one-marshmallow processes better than two-marshmallow processes. - zubin interesting. so are you some kind of communist? i'm just gonna establish this now. - daniel no, the critiques of, i mean, capitalism doesn't mean one thing. for some people, they think
about that as any system primarily based on private
property ownership, [1884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1884.32s)

which would've included feudalism, and a different version, whatever. and obviously, adam smith capitalism and milton
friedman capitalism are not the same kinds of structures, so with and without a central bank, with and without ai high-speed trading of complex financial instruments. they're totally different structures. i would say all versions
of it are inadequate [1906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1906.124s)

for a long-term viable system, but so are all versions
of communism, socialism, and other economic systems
as we've proposed them, so- - zubin perfect.
- daniel there's a lot to learn from all of them. there's a lot about theory
of markets that's important, but the long-term system, like what isn't, what do
we have to think about in terms of economics
for making it through all of the catastrophic
risks the world faces? [1927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1927.911s)

and if it's not obvious, briefly, what the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are, you have all the environmental risks that are the result of
the cumulative effects of industrialization and globalization. and so, dead zones in oceans, overfishing, biodiversity law, species
extinction, topsoil erosion, [[climate change]], blah, blah,
blah, all of those things, peak nitrogen, phosphorous, whatever, all of those are the result of being able [1951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1951.079s)

to extract resources from the world much faster than they
can replenish themselves, and turn them into waste much faster than the earth can process them, i.e. a linear [[materials economy]]
running on a finite planet that is bound to a monetary
system that has a need for [[exponential growth]]
to keep up with interest. and so, the [[exponential growth]]
of the monetary system forces an [[exponential growth]]
of depletion on one side and pollution on the other side. [1974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1974.82s)

you get all the [[planetary boundary]] issues. so that's one set of things, and obviously, there's an economic driver associated with all of that, right? we have to change economics
to be able to make sure that the social sphere and
technosphere are compatible with the biosphere, right? now, the social sphere-technosphere
combo is debasing the biosphere they depend on. - zubin and you can probably point [1993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=1993.384s)

at the root of that being the primary economic drivers
now are one-marshmallow drivers that do not necessarily
promote two-marshmallow, delayed, longer term thinking when it comes to those
[[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]]. so in other words, if i don't
go out and fish the oceans, another country will, if i, like sort of tragedy of the commons, like if i don't mine that particular ore, some other company will come, [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2020.532s)

and knock the top of that mountain off, and pollute the rivers, and so on. and it's all in the service of the particular economic model, that is, you're trying
to generate revenue, and those things are rewarded
in the current system. - daniel yeah, and you know,
the economic system creates a discount rate on future value, one, 'cause you can't predict it fully, but two, the current value gives me [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2039.941s)

the ability to invest that capital, and make compounding interest, or other kinds of financial
services investments with it. it also gives me increased optionality in a changing environment. and so, not knowing what
the environment will hold, and wanting to do the best i can, i want the most choice tokens, right? and the dollar is a choice token. it's the ability to, with
very high optionality [2059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2059.739s)

and high liquidity, do
whatever would be adaptive, whereas if i have a bunch of farmland, and the thing that i want in
the moment isn't farmland, selling it is gonna be, take a while. if i have a bunch of mining rights, or i have a bunch of
timber, or whatever it is, and especially if i have a bunch of trees that aren't yet timber, and then i decide that i want
to turn them into capital for some purpose, there's a long lag time. [2081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2081.318s)

so there's a [[game theory]] optimization towards more optionality, which means that the thing
that has no real value, right, the dollar is purely
representational value, but with maximum
liquidity and optionality. i don't want the things with real value. i want to convert things with real value into the things with the
only fictitious value, but that maximizes my optionality. and that's very much a short-term interest [2102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2102.401s)

multiplied by a competitive
[[collective action]] problem that is just where each
agent making the choice that is good for them
in the short-term is, creates a collective making
maximally bad choices for the whole for the long-term. - zubin and that in itself, and this idea that cash
is king for that reason, the idea that those long-term choices are the potential civilization-level
risks that we face, whether it's environmental,
whether it's technological, [2127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2127.586s)

whether it's national defense,
whether it's nuclear war, all the things that you talk about. and i think, so going
back to the capitalism is a one-marshmallow sort of optimizer, how does that then relate to
where we are technologically, say, with one civilization-level threat, which is big tech, social
media attention hijack? - daniel yeah, i mean, it's like something that
anyone one would learn in the beginning of their business career [2157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2157.04s)

that every business wants to optimize the lifetime revenue of a customer. and addiction is a really
good way to optimize lifetime revenue of a customer, right? - zubin every hustler
on the street knows this. - daniel and so, i want, like the best business will apply to the most number of people, and have the most need
for continuous purchases. and so, it's like, it's hard
to beat fast food, right? [2175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2175.874s)

it's hard to, like we can
start when they're young. we can make it apply to almost everybody, and have it be a daily point
of purchase for forever. and that's why mcdonald's became very big, and nestle, and you know, whatever, and coca-cola, and all those. but even that is actually
dwarfed by [[social media]], because obviously, a kid
can start with an ipad before they can talk.
- zubin yeah. - daniel and start getting conditioned [2206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2206.482s)

to [[hypernormal stimuli]] and
customized environments to them. so we can start very young. the most time someone
gets a coke is still less than they check their phone, right? and so, the total number
of points of contact, and it's optimizing
for [[hypernormal stimuli]] across lots of vectors, right? it's getting your-
- zubin news- - daniel media outrage. it's helping, you know, sex appeal, [2227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2227.934s)

food that you're interested
in, stuff like, and- - zubin social credit. - daniel and it's personalized to you with ai optimization.
- zubin right. - daniel and so, your newsfeed is like if i got to test every
different version of salt, fat, sugar, artificial flavor combinations that maximize addictiveness to you, and hostess could do that for each person, that's what [[social media]]
is for the newsfeed. - zubin that's terrifying,
but it's absolutely true. anyone who's seen the ads
that they get directed, anyone's seen youtube's, youtube's algorithm i've been
noticing quite a bit lately, because it is supernatural
at reading my mind. it knows how to connect me to
people that i'm interested in. it knows, interestingly, here's
a scary thing as a creator, it knows how to connect me to
people who are making videos that create fomo for me as a creator. "oh my god, how did that
guy interview so-and-so? [2275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2275.688s)

"i've been trying to get
that guy on my show forever. "how did, daniel schmachtenberger? "how'd he get daniel schmachtenberger? "rogan, you loser!" like i'm like, "put 'em up!" and it actually knows me in a
way better than i know myself. it's almost hacked into my brain stem, and reading that, and it's
able to monetize that. - daniel and so, if it wasn't doing that for a fundamentally extractive purpose, [2295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2295.956s)

it'd be a pretty cool tech. - zubin it'd be pretty amazing if it could do something good. - daniel if you could
configure it to do that in a developmental direction.
- zubin ah. - daniel right, if you
had some controls over it. and so, there's a category of tech that i would say, there's a few categories
of tech that are distinct from previous categories. [2315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2315.534s)

so for instance, autopoietic
tech, self-replicating tech, is different than
non-self-replicating tech. if i, and this is one of the reasons that so many people have
gotten really concerned about bio recently,
whether it's synthetic bio, or crispr, or whatever, is because as fucked up as nukes are, they don't make more nukes. they don't automatically
perpetuate more nukes, unless you have a mutually
assured destruction type [2335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2335.223s)

scenario, which is the
deterrent to not use it. but if you release even accidentally a living self-replicating thing, you've initiated a cascade phenomena that is way harder to
predict what it's gonna do, or ever stop. and we know it happens when you introduce an invasive species to an environment, where the environment didn't
develop natural resilience to whatever that thing does. [2356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2356.871s)

it can really fuck up an environment. but what about if you
release an invasive species that is more different
than anything else was, 'cause it didn't even arise
through evolutionary process? - zubin yeah. - daniel well, it might just die off, 'cause it's not that hardy, but if it has faster feedback loops, that could be destructive
to everything very quickly. so biotech the soonest, but then nanotech [2373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2373.879s)

and ai all have these kind of
self-replicating properties. that needs to be its own risk category that's separate from everything else, because the ability to do risk
calculus on it is so hard, and the ability to ever do post
facto mitigation is so hard. there's another category, but you can say something about that- - zubin no, i was just
gonna say you reach the end of your ability to model those things. they reach a kind of singularity, [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2394.764s)

where they're doing things that you could never have predicted, because the emergent
properties of the system are way more complex than any
model you have to model it, and that's what's scary about it. that's actually the argument
people make about gmos, and things like that. and i'm not sure, you know, i don't think it's necessarily
applicable to most gmos, but in theory, it certainly is. [2410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2410.971s)

- daniel the risk-reward calculus, and the risk tolerance has to change under really catastrophic
risk possibility, even if it's very low possibility, very low probability, but you're doing something
that's gonna have a lot of total numbers of things with that low probability-
- zubin right. - daniel what tolerance do we have for any probability of something
that's totally existential? [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2432.22s)

- zubin yeah. - daniel and yet, there's
a perverse [[game theory]] in the incentive, which
is whoever's oriented to the opportunity will do better than whoever's more oriented to mitigate against the risk, right? because if i say, "eh,
the risk isn't that high. "you guys are scared
of a bunch of nothing. "you're being hyperbolic. "look at the opportunity. [2456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2456.591s)

"we can," blah, blah, blah, "cure cancer, "connect the world,"
blah, whatever the thing that the [[exponential tech]] can do in that positive application is, they're gonna go get the market share, get the money, whatever, and then the harms are
gonna be socialized. they're not gonna be held
accountable fundamentally, or they'll figure out how to bankrupt it, and restart, or whatever it is
that is the legal strategies [2471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2471.028s)

a big company with
limited liability can use and good lawyers. and so, they have the incentive. you have a lot of
incentive on opportunity, and that's the kind of silicon valley move fast and break things motto. - zubin yup.
- daniel and so, you privatize the gain,
socialize the losses, awesome. now, if your focuses do
really good anticipation of second and third-order effects, [2492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2492.277s)

identify wherever there
might be an externality, figure out how to internalize it, you're just gonna go so fuckin' slow, and spend so much research
money that you just lose. - zubin you'll go broke. - daniel yeah.
- zubin yeah. - daniel so unfortunately, again, there is a [[perverse incentive]]
to do the riskier versions, pretend they're less risky, only do bullshit versions of risk analysis [2507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2507.615s)

for [[plausible deniability]] that you did it. - zubin wait, why does
this sound like everything zuckerberg's doing right now? - daniel you can pick him,
but you can pick others too- - zubin i'll pick
anybody, i'll pick anybody. but so, this is interesting. have you, i imagine you've seen the movie "don't look up," and- - daniel i haven't
actually seen it, but i know- - zubin you know the premise. [2527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2527.681s)

- daniel yeah.
- zubin so everything that you're pointing to, everything that, and
honestly, i watched the movie, and i don't see it as a, you
know, [[climate change]] thing. i saw it as a covid thing, 'cause you frame it
however you wanna frame it- - daniel any [[catastrophic risk]]. - zubin any [[catastrophic risk]], and covid isn't really
a [[catastrophic risk]], but i saw it framed as the science versus, [2541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2541.415s)

thesis-antithesis kind of thing. it was so depressing to watch because it held up a mirror
exactly to these kind of things, like the short-term gain issue. they wanna mine this asteroid,
instead of destroy it. so the equivalent of zuckerberg
decides he's gonna do this, and i mean, it was crazy, and i was watching it going, "no, that's exactly what would happen." that's exactly what would
happen with our current thing, [2563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2563.245s)

and the [[social media]] was
deployed tribalizing people. there's a meaning crisis
and there's a sense crisis, like what even is real? is the asteroid even there? hence the title of the
movie, "don't look up." well, don't look up, or you'll
see what's actually there. (zubin laughs)
it's right there. - daniel yeah, so i mean, this is also important, obviously. we live in a reality
where most of the stuff [2584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2584.891s)

that feels most
consequential that we believe we have no first-person sensing of. - zubin right.
- daniel we are getting it mediated through a 2d screen, through other people's thinking, and other institutions, and you know, those types of things. that's significant, right? it's significant to people's ability to have collective
intelligence systems work. [2608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2608.173s)

there's a book, i think it was called "the politics of the invisible" that was looking at regulation
issues after chernobyl, where, you know, should farmers
be allowed to grow food here and sell it that the countries
had to deal with downwind of where chernobyl was given
that the uranium was invisible. and for the first time ever,
not the first time ever, but like for the first time
it became really obvious that there was totally invisible stuff that was totally consequential. [2637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2637.542s)

so the farmers and the
layperson had to trust those who had the ability with the
geiger counters, and whatever, to tell us stuff that
only the priestly class that understood how to do that could do. - zubin oh.
- daniel because now, we're engineering in the invisible in a really fundamental way. - zubin which we're not
designed to deal with as humans- - daniel we don't have
the ability to all check and balance and go through
the same epistemic process. [2655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2655.993s)

so unless you happen to
have the geiger counters, and the knowledge of nuclear
physics, and et cetera, and then the biophysics to say, well, how much increased
radiation of what type is gonna create how much mutation to then be able to weigh
against the difficulty of the farmers not losing their jobs, and those types of things.
- zubin yeah. - daniel and so, having created a very scientifically
advanced society also means [2675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2675.344s)

that then you need a lot
of scientific insight to weigh in on the policy things. but that also means now people have to just
trust a priestly class. and, or they all have to
be adequately educated, and have access to all of those tools, and that, like adequately educated about virology, and nuclear
physics, and epidemiology, and climate, and et cetera-
- zubin not possible. - daniel so you start to
reach information limits. [2697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2697.173s)

so then you have to say, "well, fuck it, "we need institutions that are trustworthy "that can do that." well, how do you get trust? how do you get everybody to
be able to trust institutions? even if you had an institution
emerge that everyone trusted, 'cause it had some transparent way of being able to show real
good epistemic process, and lack of vested interest, and rigor, and checks and balances on power, [2718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2718.221s)

and it became a kind of
legitimate authority, there's so much power to
being a legitimate authority, to being able to be the
arbiter of what is real that everyone who wants to
win at the game of power will have a maximum incentive
to try to corrupt that thing. - zubin hmm. - daniel and so, then who wins? the scientists, and mathematicians, and philosophers focused on the thing, or the best players at the game of power, [2740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2740.419s)

who are funding the thing, who have a maximum
incentive to start moving it in one particular direction? so how do you maintain
legitimate authority and have it not get captured? it's a real tricky thing. - zubin why does this
feel so familiar, daniel, to a certain experience we've
had over the past two years, where there are factions, who just, there's no way to even make sense, [2760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2760.754s)

and anybody can hijack
the mantle of authority, including the mainstream,
including the antithesis, including it doesn't matter, put some letters after your
name, and say some stuff. and how is an average
person without the education in virology, epidemiology, biostats, all the other stuff supposed
to make sense of it? and this has been a fundamental problem. - daniel well, i'll just
say it live on your show. this is why, since you do such a good job [2786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2786.678s)

of steel manning the
various points of view, being able to look at synthesis and antithesis with regard to covid, i mean, thesis, antithesis, i think it would be fantastic for you to get leading earnest thinkers on both sides of the lab leak hypothesis, the vaccine mandate, the
small molecule approach, all of the major issues,
and be able to facilitate a structured dialectic that
identified what they agreed on, [2815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2815.267s)

where they disagreed, what the basis of that disagreement was, what
it would take to resolve it that used really, that
oriented away from rhetoric and towards good formal methodology, and that everybody got to watch and see. i think that would be amazing, and i think you're the right guy to do it. - zubin how dare you, number one, okay? number two, what you're
describing is a solution, is one solution to this
sense-making crisis, [2838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2838.538s)

which i think i feel very
strongly about as well, this idea, and you used a term that
i think we should explain, steel manning. you said steel manning. so it probably behooves us to understand what a straw man is, and then we can talk about a steel man. so very quickly, a straw
man is where you take an opponent's argument,
and you actually distort it in a way that you, and you can correct me [2858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2858.048s)

if i'm explaining this wrong,
and you put it out there, and go, "well, see, what they're saying is "that they wanna kill all
kids by not vaccinating them." that's called a straw man, 'cause you're building the
straw man, then you attack it, 'cause it's easy to attack, right? so it's misunderstanding, or
purposefully misrepresenting what they're saying to create a straw man. a steel man, on the
other hand, is actually deeply re-conveying what the argument is [2878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2878.333s)

in very clear terms to
where even the people who believe this argument are like, "yeah, you nailed it,
that's what we're saying." - daniel yeah. straw man's where you are obviously just putting them down
and being pejorative, appeal to your own base,
but that's about it. the worst straw mans are
the ones that look like they're steel manning,
but they aren't, right? you say, "well, it's
understandable why such-and-such, [2901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2901.438s)

"and why they would think this, "and they care about this and this," and it seems like you're empathizing, but it's a faux empathy,
'cause what you're doing is setting up what looks like you empathize, so that you're setting up what looks like a solid understanding of the thesis, so that then when you
critique and take it down, people will assume that
you understand it well, except you constructed it in
a way that looked earnest, [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2920.502s)

wasn't, and had weakness in it, right? so the faux steel man straw man is the most common dreadful one.
- zubin uh-huh. - daniel real steel
manning is where someone who has actual expertise
and care on the other side would say, "i have nothing to add." - zubin yeah.
- daniel like you actually comprehensively did the thing. - zubin you got it good, yeah, and that's important,
because first of all, [2941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2941.448s)

then it eliminates the straw man effect where you're deliberately
weakening the opponent's argument by misrepresenting it, and ad hominem-ing, and all of the other stuff that you might throw into the straw man cocktail. and it shows that you actually understand what they're saying, which
means you already have some degree of empathy
with what they're doing, which is important, i think. - daniel yeah, i mean,
it does several things. [2964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2964.099s)

it communicates enough respect for another fellow human being, or tribe, or group of people that you- - zubin assumes good
intent, too, probably- - daniel you took the time
to see what they were saying, and it shows that what you say doesn't need to be dismissed instantly, as you didn't get where
they were coming from first. - zubin right, which is important, yeah. - daniel and this is one, [2981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=2981.654s)

like democracy requires this process. democracy, like modern
democracies, the us, and other kind of modern
european democracies, emerged out out of kind
of european enlightenment, cultural enlightenment, and
this is why the founders in the us said, "this system only works "with a comprehensively
educated citizenry." and george washington said, "it's the primary aim of the
federal government to ensure "the comprehensive education
in the science of government [3006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3006.833s)

"of every single citizen," science of government meaning everything you would need to understand to know how to do collective choice-making well. so the difficulties of game
theory and vested interest, economics, history, all those things, comprehensive education of every citizen in science of government
is the number one goal of the federal government, because if the number
one goal is rule of law, [3023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3023.51s)

you can do it with a police state. if the number one goal is
to protect the boundaries, you can do it with a
military dictatorship. if you have the number one goal of being anything other than the
comprehensive education of every single citizen,
it won't be a democracy, 'cause democracy's very fragile, and requires that kind of thing, and it requires not only
that everyone can make sense of third-person reality together, [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3040.597s)

apply the philosophy of science, and kind of natural philosophy, but that they can make sense
of each other's positions and value systems well, which
is the good faith discourse, the empathy, the hegelian dialectic. can i really argue your position well? without that, democracy has no chance. and so, when people have
made their fellow countrymen the primary enemy, they are
actually, in the short-term, they think they're trying
to win a battle about covid, [3063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3063.71s)

or [[climate change]], or systemic racism, or whatever the thing is. what they're actually
doing is waging a war against democratic process writ large, where as you're making
your primary countrymen the primary enemy, where all of the energy within that system goes to infighting, and then you elect more
polarized representatives, who create more gridlock, authoritarian countries
are just gonna do better [3085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3085.021s)

geopolitically across every way. and then you're actually, what you're really fighting for
is the authoritarian process to have more global influence
over the 21st century. - zubin yeah. we're fighting for china, basically. - daniel so really, the
democratic process requires an [[epistemic commons]], shared sense-making, and shared meaning-making to
inform shared choice-making. democracy is a shared
choice-making process. [3106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3106.31s)

but that means that we
have to have some process to talk about what is- - zubin right, sense-making, right. - daniel and some process
to talk about what do we want, and i have to be able to
understand the thing that you want and understand that just
fucking you with the thing, you don't stop being a political actor, and then you're gonna act
even harder next time. we're just gonna escalate [[arms race]]. - zubin yeah.
- daniel so how do we make [3124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3124.413s)

compromises that address
what everybody wants? - zubin yeah.
- daniel and so, the bad faith argumentation destroys the social contract, and the [[epistemic commons]],
destroys democracy. good faith argumentation
is not sufficient, but is necessary. and so, the steel man is the beginning of a good faith argument. - zubin brilliant, and i'll say this. [3147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3147.119s)

if you look at any comment
on youtube (laughs) on, say, any of my videos, you can find accusations of bad faith,
accusations of capture, accusations of all kinds of
straw manning of my arguments, and things like that,
and this is a common, this is the default comment
that will rise in the rankings in terms of likes on a youtube algorithm, or on a facebook algorithm. and so, this then dovetails nicely into how is [[social media]]
then kind of weaponizing this process in a way that
maybe wasn't intentional, but is now the epiphenomenon of everything from the incentives that set it up to the algorithms that now run it to our primitive brains that
are being addicted to it? how then is it creating civilization-level risks in us, including the simple
question of are we generating a ton of, like, we talked
about this offline, a ton of subclinical mental
illness in people, you know? [3203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3203.332s)

like what are we doing? - daniel okay, we've
got like at least three really important directions to go here, the subclinical mental illness, or kind of like ubiquitous psychopathology of the whole population that
is not innate to being human, but a epiphenomena of
the civilization design, and honestly ubiquitous
subclinical psychopathology and physiopathology, both, right? - zubin mental and physical illness. [3235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3235.282s)

- daniel yeah.
- zubin and when you say subclinical,
meaning it hasn't quite reached the threshold-
- daniel diagnosable. - zubin being diagnosed- - daniel but in the direction of. - zubin in the direction of,
and the other thing you said, just to tie it in, is
that the anthropocene, this era of this technology
feeding back to us, is generating this. this is not something innate to us. [3253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3253.74s)

- daniel yeah.
- zubin it's a feedback with this technology- - daniel okay, so that was one thing. the other is what does [[social media]] do that is intrinsically destructive
to the social contract, the [[epistemic commons]], democracy itself, and maybe other stuff?
- zubin mmm-hmm. - daniel and that gets
to, i was starting to give the example of there's a
unique category of tech, which is self-replicating tech, [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3271.705s)

just to basically say there's
a few novel categories of tech that [[exponential tech]] makes. the one i wanted to get
into was [[social media]], why it's a unique category of tech, so i'll add that in there. - zubin let's do that, uh-huh. - daniel but then the third
thing that you brought up, which was why do those comments that are cynical on you emerge the most, let me do that one real quick. [3288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3288.367s)

- zubin yeah, let's do that. by the way, i never write shit
down when i'm interviewing, but with you, it's like
we're doing all this stuff, i have to write it down, or
we'll never come back to it. (zubin laughs) - daniel they're all good,
and they're all interconnected. we could take any of the
directions to begin with- - zubin perfect, yeah, hit me with the cynical comment piece. - daniel so kind of drawing
on the pre/trans framework [3303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3303.752s)

that ken wilber popularized, i won't even bother
constructing that right now. people can look it up. i'll just say- - zubin i've talked
about it before, too, yeah. - daniel one kind of
model of the development people go through in terms of [[game theory]], like their own intuition of [[game theory]], you could call naive,
cynical, post-cynical as a developmental
process in the direction [3327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3327.262s)

of increased capacity to do citizenry. naive is where you assume good intent on other people's parts
as a kind of default. you assume that what people are saying is generally what they believe, and that other people's
interior experience is probably a lot like yours, and that where fucked up things
are happening is probably mostly because of mistakes,
and things like that. and if you interact with the world, [3355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3355.526s)

and particularly systems of power enough, that will become destroyed in you, right? and then the naivete will crash
upon the rocks of reality, and then you'll move into a cynical place, where you realize how much ladder-climbing, how much of virtue is virtue signaling, how much of communication
as a whole is strategic, where someone is saying something for the effect they want it to have, [3380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3380.959s)

not just for what they maximally believe, how much of the epistemic
commons is the result of everyone's agentic desire to make other people believe stuff,
rather than just what is true, all those types of things, right- - zubin and by the way-
- daniel get cynical. - zubin and when you
say [[epistemic commons]], you're talking about the where,
how we even get information by epistemic, yeah.
- daniel yeah. we could call it the knowledge commons, [3399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3399.617s)

which is just the available information that we can all look at.
- zubin yeah. - daniel but it's
not just the knowledge, because the methodology that produced it, right, the epistemic
process, is gonna be key to whether or not i believe
it, how i factor it, all those types of things, and
then what do i do with that? there's an epistemic process
of how do i factor that data to actually come up with
forecasts, and conclusions. and so, the data is not
that interesting by itself. [3422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3422.273s)

the entire [[epistemic commons]], how do we collectively make
sense of the world together? - zubin got it, got
it, so you had the naive, then you had the cynical. - daniel yeah, now, in cynical, so you read machiavelli, and
you get a good description of the cynical, and that
that type of court dynamic is actually playing out. and typically around any center of power, there's something like court dynamics. around any very wealthy person, you watch in their social circle, and there's something like court dynamics. - zubin yes, we've all seen it. we see it at cdc, we see it at fda, we see it every big institution. - daniel and so, then you
end up getting situations, where whoever is in the
position of most power will get a distortion bubble of the
type of feedback they get because people want something from them, [3463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3463.807s)

so there are certain
types of disagreements that won't happen. so then you'll get the
propagation of their own biases, and other people confirming it, and all kind of nonsense like that, right? - zubin the steve jobs
reality distortion field type of deal. actually, that's-
- daniel there's different kinds of reality distortion. this is one kind of vested
interest reality distortion, [3478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3478.637s)

and if you want an introduction
to how to think cynically, "the 48 laws of power" is
probably the best you can get. - zubin "48 laws of
power," who's that by? - daniel robert greene.
- zubin got it, okay. - daniel and he's taking machiavelli, but also sun tzu, and von clausewitz, and most of the kind
of strategic thinkers, and giving a summary of how
does the game of power work. - zubin yeah. - daniel and... [3501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3501.273s)

and you know you're in the cynical if you say something like, "if you don't know who the
sucker in the room is, it's you." - zubin yeah.
- daniel right? because you assume that the game of power is happening everywhere,
there is some suckers, they're getting taken
advantage of, et cetera. - zubin yeah.
- daniel i think the key is that there is such a
thing as post-cynical, and the cynical would say, [3522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3522.424s)

"the only thing that is
not cynical is naive," because typically, things
don't even have an awareness of a developmental stage
that is beyond them- - zubin that's right-
- daniel so that's where you get mistakes-
- zubin blindness, yeah. - daniel so the-post-cynical says it is possible to authentically
care about something more than just self-interest in a way that you're actually willing to make real sacrifice for, [3544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3544.733s)

and that they're are
other people who also can, and that authentic relationships
of trust can be formed. - zubin hmm. - daniel so i couldn't be post-cynical if i didn't believe that
there were other people that could be post-cynical. right, 'cause i have
to believe i can have- - zubin they need to be there. - daniel of trust. - zubin if everybody else is cynical, [3559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3559.994s)

you can't, there's no trust. if everybody else is naive,
there's no, you can't do it. - daniel if they're just naive- - zubin yeah.
- daniel i can't trust 'em that much, because on accident, they'll get played by the cynical people, and even though they're
trying to be loyal, the whole thing will still get fucked up- - zubin it'll fall apart-
- daniel i have to know that the other people have
an immunity to that process, [3573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3573.034s)

that they're aware of it, but
they are also not bound to it. this is in the world, but not of it, right?
- zubin ah. - daniel and so, to be post-cynical, you have to know that other
people can be post-cynical, and then you have to be able to know how, what is a legitimate basis of
trust, and how do i know that? how do i sense that? and so, what i would say is post-cynical good faith communication [3595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3595.355s)

is necessary for something like the continuation of anything that's at all democratic, or republic. anything that has participatory governance and is not just the people
being ruled requires the people being able to develop that. so that has to become the center
of the values of a culture that then develops that in people and checks it and reinforces it. - zubin so does a post-cynical,
this is fascinating. [3618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3618.91s)

does a post-cynical standpoint require the sort of transcending and including the naive
and the cynical standpoint? - daniel of course. - zubin so you have
to be able to understand and inhabit the naive and the cynical to develop a post-cynical. - daniel in the same
way that a metamodern, or an integral, or a
post-postmodern system actually has to understand postmodernist
critiques on modernity well, [3644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3644.813s)

and then also understand
modernity well, right? you have to understand the philosophy of science-
- zubin yeah. - daniel and the hegelian dialectic. you have to understand
the postmodern critique of why there is no objective fact. - zubin right.
- daniel and why there is no objective absolute perspective, and claiming it's probably
some type of imperialism, or power game in that you
can't separate game of power [3660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3660.615s)

from the propagation of ideas.
- zubin yeah. - daniel and then not
just leave it there, 'cause that's an untenable
place to leave it, and say how do we take that
critique as a refinement, 'cause that's a deconstruction process. how do we take that
deconstruction as a refinement to a constructive process, which means everybody
can get on the same page with something other
than the game of power, 'cause if all there is
is the game of power, [3680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3680.155s)

and all truth claims have no basis other than claimant power, then what you're actually
doing is exalting power as the only possible thing, and that thing actually
self-terminates, right? a situation where everyone is just playing the game of power, where that means that
the [[epistemic commons]] and the social contract
break, democracy breaks, you can't sense-make
[[climate change]] well enough to do any solution with it that half the population doesn't resist, or covid, or ai, or anything. and so, you have to come to a way of being able to make sense of the world, address values, and cooperate
beyond just the game of power, which you know, kind of
the metamodern thing. so the same with the post-cynical, right? the post-cynical understands
why the cynical is there, and has to be resilient to that. [3724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3724.569s)

so let's go ahead, and see where, say, a left, or woke perspective
would say good faith just means you're a naive sucker, because let's say we're talking to a native
american about the history of the us keeping its agreements
with native americans. and they're like, "okay,
well, good faith communication "just continues to privilege
the current power system, "because it just says let's
all be polite, and civil, "and whatever, and not address the fact [3755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3755.179s)

"that the power system came the way it was "by some people totally
fucking other people, "and there's no real push
for them to change it, "and the victors rarely just give that up, "and every time we made the agreement, "then they fuckin'
violated the agreement." and the black community
could say the same thing. if you go and look at
the history of like, oh, emancipation proclamation, but then fuckin' jim crow, and peonage, [3776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3776.441s)

and you're like okay. so at some point, oh, i see, your argument about being good
faith is just gaslighting. you're not gonna be in good faith. you're gonna pretend. you're gonna ask us to be in good faith, and then just fuck us- - zubin and you're gonna screw us. - daniel yeah.
- zubin oh, you see this play out on [[social media]] all the time- - daniel in which
case cynicism then seems like the only informed thing.
- zubin right. - daniel and so, you
have to have some process to be able to say how do i show up to a good faith process and really sense if the other side is, and ensure they are, and orient towards that simultaneously, 'cause otherwise, we get defect-defect in the prisoner's dilemma. how do we get something to
ensure against defect-defect [3812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3812.864s)

and be able to have cooperate-cooperate, because everybody rationally
doing defect-defect leads to catastrophe for everybody.
- zubin yeah, yeah, and that prisoner's dilemma
we'll talk about another time, but the basic idea is
that this is [[game theory]], and this, so this is
fascinating, because again, all these pieces that we're
talking about are actually, and i've never really fragmented them into these little bits that
are actually very helpful to make explicit. [3840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3840.398s)

this post-cynical idea of discourse, it is central to what i call alt-middle, which is really, again, it's integral. it's an integral perspective. it's saying okay, how
are we gonna make sense? how are we gonna have dialogue? how are we gonna try to find
our way through the morass of what is, and what ought to be if we can't even agree that
we're acting in good faith and that everybody's
accusing everybody else [3860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3860.912s)

of bad faith, right? so well, and i'm just, so, again, going, boy, i almost
feel like we have to go back. we should go and do
one of these other two, because otherwise, we could
do a whole show on just that. do you wanna do subclinical
mental illness here, or do you wanna do [[social media]]
as a destructive element of, they kind of feed into
each other a little bit- - daniel yeah, you pick. - zubin all right, let's talk about [3881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3881.346s)

subclinical mental illness, because i'm obsessed with this idea. you and i were talking about it before, and i was just like, "yeah,
we need to talk about this," because this idea that
something in our anthropocene, and what we're doing
technologically, sociologically, environmentally, et cetera, is generating a pandemic of multiple things, narcissism, anxiety, depression, and not
all of this is being diagnosed, so we call it subclinical,
but some of it is, [3906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3906.763s)

emotional repression. there's a whole web of
things that's happening that is fed back onto, and
potentially in a causative loop with the very technology that
we're talking about here. i'm curious how you think about this, because again, we see it
in, say, primary care. there's a saying that like, "hey, 50% of what we
see is supratentorial," above the tentorium of
the brain in the cortex, in other words, it's,
everything is biopsychosocial, [3932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3932.433s)

but this is particularly psychosocial, and whether it's depression, or whatever, and it's manifesting
as a physical illness, because everything is interrelated. everything is biopsychosocial, so i'm curious how you think about this. - daniel well, humans are very adaptive. biology in general is adaptive. humans are particularly adaptive. it's actually, the thing we were saying [3953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3953.422s)

about humans' ability to do tech co-evolved with how adaptive we are in a way that's an important
point to just take a moment on. other animals are shaped by
their environment, right? a particular mutation
either is more advantageous, or not in that environment. the longer neck is useful
if there's leaves higher up, or whatever it is. so the animal's really
formed by its environment. since the tool-making process, [3980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=3980.91s)

we were gonna be changing
our environments, right? we could both move environment, 'cause we could put
the tool of clothes on, and go to a cold place,
or whatever it was, and we would start making dwelling units, and other things, change our environment. we couldn't be too genetically adapted to a particular environment, since we're gonna be
continuously changing it. and so, this is one argument
on why humans are neotenous [4001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4001.819s)

for so long, right, why
we're still kind of helpless and embryonic for so long
compared to any other animal, is, you know, it takes us a
year before we're even walking, and it takes a horse five
to 20 minutes to be walking, and there's no way horses
would survive taking that long. it takes a humongous amount
of parental attention to keep these little
things alive for so long. like why are we helpless
and useless for so long? because there's less inbuilt
code on how to be what we are because we're gonna be
exposed to new environments [4030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4030.617s)

where we have to actually be soft-wired rather than hard-wired to the
new environment we created. so we're gonna be able to learn
whatever language is here, we're gonna be able to learn
how to use these tools. the most fit person in the paleolithic era at being able to throw spears
is not that good in a time where texting and other
shit is more useful, right? - zubin so this hardware,
this hardware of humans that starts out so neotenous, meaning we're babyish for so long. [4056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4056.15s)

- daniel yeah, so we're saying, so one of the things
that's unique to us is that our genetics selected
for memetics, right? - zubin meaning mimicry. - daniel meaning mimicry, meaning- - zubin not like meme like
the memes we think about, m-i-m-e, yeah? - daniel i do mean the
memes we think about- - zubin oh, okay, okay- - daniel the memes we
think about online are [4076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4076.937s)

an expression of, online, the idea of a meme, the way dawkins coined
it in "the selfish gene," that what a gene is to biology, which is a little piece of code that codes a particular
behavior and replicates itself, a meme is to consciousness, or
culture a little unit of code that codes a behavior, and
seeks to replicate itself. so beliefs, aesthetics,
fashions, whatever, end up both making you
behave a certain way, [4101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4101.88s)

and then as other people
see you behaving that way, end up leading to- - zubin they spread.
- daniel spread, right? - zubin they spread, yeah.
- daniel and so, our genes haven't changed a lot. our memes changed very,
very, very quickly, and our behavior changes,
and our culture changes, and our technosphere changes. so we are adaptive in a way
nothing else is adaptive because it's so software-based, right? [4123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4123.513s)

like our hardware is
selected for the ability to do fast software upgrades. - zubin ah. - daniel and so, i wouldn't, it's weird to talk about mental illness, 'cause in one way, mental illness is a destructive normative concept, 'cause what we define
as mentally ill is based on the dominant paradigm of the time. so obviously, believing in
animism was mental illness [4143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4143.911s)

during oppressive catholic dark ages. - zubin right, right. - daniel and you know, women with mania, or hysteria, because they had a sexual
impulse, was a mental illness at a certain time, and-
- zubin right. - daniel so to some degree, it's like basically the
psychiatric diagnosis is how to keep everyone behaving within that civilization model. [4165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4165.56s)

- zubin yeah.
- daniel and it's saying anything outside of that is bad, even though it might be quite healthy, and this was like krishnamurti's statement that being well-adjusted to
a profoundly insane society is not a good measure of mental health. - zubin there you go,
dsm-v criticism right there. (zubin laughs) - daniel and yet, on
the other side we can say, so one way we can say
the ways that people are [4184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4184.814s)

are mostly actually the
results of them being adaptive to their environment,
not maladaptive, right, but being adaptive, but in an environment that incentivizes you to
lie, and to not trust people, and to even weaponize trust
by creating fake trust in people, so you can then, you know, take advantage of them, whatever,
if that's adaptive, right, you're actually being
environmentally trained to be that way. you're getting feedback- [4208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4208.612s)

- zubin that's right-
- daniel on being that way. - zubin i'm starting to smell a narcissism undercurrent
here, right, with [[social media]]. - daniel so you think
about [[social media]], and there's a gazillion things about it. but obviously, there, most of what comes is
very short number of bits with some kind of dopamine hit associated. i've got some pictures, images, whatever, not that many bits, then the next one, [4231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4231.116s)

nothing like very long text fields. somebody's gonna bounce on that. so it shortens attention span, and just hits a lot of
[[hypernormal stimuli]], which means then normal stimuli
don't do anything, right? once you've watched enough of
the super airbrushed pictures, then normal women start
to look less pretty. - zubin once you've
seen enough porn, yeah. - daniel then you can
actually fetishize formally it, meaning you can't eroticize without it. [4253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4253.212s)

- zubin right.
- daniel in the same way that fruits and vegetables
don't taste good once you've done too much mcdonald's. - zubin right, or even
an impossible burger, which is apparently all vegetables, but tastes like crack to me. - daniel so you're providing
a [[hypernormal stimuli]] that then desensitizes the receptor to normal stimuli, right? which means that it's actually
decreasing the potential [4273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4273.784s)

from happiness and contact
with the world, right? now, you need a narrower thing
with higher amounts of it and saturation to be able
to get any effect at all- - zubin the same level,
and not even the same level, sub-sub-level, yeah. - daniel so... so [[social media]] does all those things, but one of the things it does in the customizing of it, right, the personalizing it to you, [4296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4296.116s)

if this is starting when someone's a kid, they have this experience
that the world conforms itself to fit their preferences.
- zubin hmm. - daniel in a way that no other previous technology would have ever had a corollary to. and so, if the whole time
i'm on the digital world, it can, with very, it
takes very little action on my part, right? i push a button, [4321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4321.988s)

with very good ux to change everything. so i get a lot of change
from very little action, and it's all conforming to
personalize itself to me. the contact with the world of atoms and in the world of real
people's gonna suck- - zubin the world of remodeling
your house, for example. - daniel well, even remodeling my house, i'm still, it's gonna take more work, but i'm still trying to
personalize the world to me. - zubin right, but there's a challenge. [4345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4345.785s)

in other words, the ux
on the [[social media]] app, you can personalize your
world with a couple clicks. - daniel way easier. but so much to say tribal dynamic that was an evolutionary process was nature is not modifying itself, what eric weinstein calls
contact with the unforgiving. it's not modifying itself to you at all. the rose is gonna fuckin'
prick you if you touch it. so you have to modify yourself
to work with the environment, [4366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4366.01s)

and you have to really modify yourself to work with the tribe, right? the tribe is not all going
to bend over backwards for whatever your particular
whim of the moment is. so is that conditioning
narcissism at scale generationally in a way
that nothing ever has (zubin laughs)
along with addictiveness, short attention,
orientation to sanctimony, certainty, et cetera,
like those are really, so again, you take that humans are mold, [4391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4391.177s)

like all animals are molded
by their environment. humans change their environment, so we're more moldable to be able to become fit to new environments. we're making environments that
are more radically different than our evolutionary environments. then we are becoming
the psychological result of those things, and then are those the kinds of people we wanna be?
- zubin okay. [4409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4409.11s)

- daniel are those the kinds
of people we wanna create? - zubin okay, okay, so man, that's, this idea that we are in equilibrium in some way with our tribe,
with our environment, with our built environment,
with our technology, and it actually feeds back
into our own behaviors through these memetic
doses back and forth, it really cuts to the
heart of now are these, is this where we wanna go? is this a civilization-level threat [4433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4433.432s)

that we're developing
that self-terminates? and how does this relate
to something like, say, jonathan haidt's "coddling
of the american mind" with lakoff talking about exactly this. we're now creating a generation
of, say, fragile children and adolescents who have more
diagnosable mental illness, who have more suicidality, if
not actual executed suicides, and more inability to
cope with the challenges that, say, the previous
generations did not have as much trouble with. [4466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4466.623s)

does this all kind of tie together? i'm curious your thoughts on that. - daniel okay, so let's come back to this kind of ubiquitous
subclinical psychopathology. just as a reference of, you know, what i mean when i say subclinical is let's say we're talking
about a nutrient deficiency. there is a clinical vitamin c
deficiency, which is scurvy, which is a really, really low level, meaning you're acutely dying-
- zubin arr! [4491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4491.355s)

- daniel below that level-
- zubin scurvy knave. yup, you're losing teeth, and all that. - daniel but there is an ideal level, and there's a range in
between the ideal level and dying of scurvy. i would call that subclinical deficiency. - zubin yup.
- daniel even though it's within the healthy range, meaning not yet the formal disease. and so, i would say there is [4506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4506.835s)

a subclinical nutrient deficiency that's pretty ubiquitous
across lots of things. there's an acute level of poisoning of a particular kind of petrol toxin, or heavy metal, or whatever, but then there's any level above the evolutionary environment's
non-exposure to it that is causing some
stress on the physiology that i would call subclinical toxicity. so the volatile organic compounds
coming out of the paint, [4528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4528.59s)

and the carpet that are carcinogens, or neurotoxins, or whatever. so it's the idea that
you can have something that is disruptive to the ideal
homeodynamics of the system, but subclinical. it's not yet causing the acute pathology, but it's contributing to a causal cascade with a lot of other things
that can have an effect. so that's examples of
that physiologically. the same is true psychologically. [4554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4554.095s)

so before someone has diagnosable, you know, serious depressive
disorder, they can be much more depressive than
would be an optimal state for someone, and we can
call it kind of subclinical. before they have generalized
anxiety disorder diagnosably, they can have a lot
more background anxiety then is necessary for
the human experience. and the same is true for ocd, the same is true for complex ptsd, right? complex ptsd, where you have [4580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4580.823s)

kind of an excessive trigger response, sympathetic response to
some kind of trigger, but instead of an acute ptsd,
where that's on one event, it was a complex ptsd, meaning something that
occurred many times. i would say it's arguable that people have complex
ptsd on civilization, right? like they have this kind of
continued trauma associated with lots of things that creates an increased sympathetic
response to lots of things. [4605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4605.587s)

that is a pretty common phenomena, right? - zubin and actually,
just look at the pandemic. i mean, this has been
happening throughout. you have this constant sort of fear, people doom scrolling, all the
stuff feeding back together, and then people afraid
to leave their house, people triple masking, and
then other people saying, "i'm afraid my liberties are
gone," and reacting that way. it is this kind of pandemic of subclinical and even clinical anxiety, depression. [4626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4626.128s)

i don't know, i don't think
the narcissism component is there in that as much, because there's a sense of
lack of control to some degree, but who knows? - daniel well, i mean, i would say, so increased narcissistic trait, subclinical narcissistic
personality disorder, and i'm not saying this because i've done on the stats on it. i don't think anyone has done the stats [4649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4649.404s)

that i would want to see, so i'm speaking kind of intuitively here. first, i would say that many of these, like whatever the official
stat on how many women have gone through sexual
assault is, it's just too low. it's way too low, for a bunch of reasons, meaning almost everybody that i know has the shared consensus
that a much higher percentage of all the women they've
ever met went through some form of sexual abuse
than the one in four [4679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4679.172s)

that the statistic supposedly is. it's more like 90%, or 85%, or something. so i think there is some
kind of under-reporting, under-assessing types of
issues that are part of it. and so, when we look at what percentage of the population has
narcissistic personality disorder, whatever, that might be wrong, right? those assessments might be
wrong for any number of reasons. there's reasons to hide
that signal if you can. - zubin yeah.
- daniel but i would say [4703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4703.411s)

that the percentage of
narcissistic personality disorder, or antisocial personality disorder in the general population
is probably much higher than it ever was in an indigenous tribe, in which case i would say it was probably much, much closer to zero, because it would have
always been found out, and be non-adaptive. - zubin yeah.
- daniel and i would say it's gonna be much higher as
you climb up the stack of power [4726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4726.114s)

and you have to actually
win at lots of power games to get up there. and so, you know, there are some stats, i don't know if they're any good, but it's like, you know, 5%
in the general population and 30% in the c-suite of fortune 500s, and probably something like 90% in the c-suite of top financial
services companies, and- - zubin yeah.
- daniel so- - zubin it's adaptive
in those locations, yeah. [4747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4747.592s)

- daniel it is selected for, incentivized, conditioned.
- zubin yeah. - daniel et cetera.
- zubin all the above. - daniel which then also means that people with those conditions also have a disproportionate
amount of power and influence institutionally. - zubin which that feeds
back on a population level, because the institutions are a big part of our socio-technological environment. [4768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4768.26s)

- daniel so do i think that, you know, narcissistic traits are much higher than is native to the human condition under different
developmental environments, and particularly tribal? like tribal environment,
you're just not gonna get away with lying very well-
- zubin yeah. - daniel 'cause there's
too much surveillance. you're not gonna get
away with hurting people in a small environment,
where everybody knows [4789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4789.597s)

what's happening with everybody. you're not gonna be able to hide the effects of things, right? the increased transparency. but as soon as the
system gets large enough that you can hide the effects, then you start having
an evolutionary niche for those kinds of parasitic
and predatory behaviors. - zubin it gets right back
to the asshole agenesis. - daniel exactly.
- zubin the same exact thing [4809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4809.325s)

that now it becomes not just okay, but there is a niche where it flourishes, and it may not actually
be directly incentivized, but it certainly isn't disincentivized, and actually there are, like
you said, selection factors that actually enrich
it in that population. and then, so this is
interesting, because the idea that this exists now
at a higher level, say, than in tribal times means
that this is not something you reduce to genetics. [4834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4834.273s)

it's not something you reduce to dna. it's a complex biopsychosocial process that's an interplay between
us, our environment, our genes, our hardware, our software,
and everything else, yeah? - daniel let's say
we're looking at genes and some particular psychiatric condition, or neurological condition. it's like does everyone
with apoe4 get alzheimer's? no, are there some people
who have alzheimer's that don't have apoe4? [4859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4859.307s)

yes, so that's part of, that's
one type of causal dynamic. it is not a one-for-one causation. typically, in biological situations, it's not simple as one cause, right? it's a lot of things that
collectively can reach a threshold and you have nexus causation.
- zubin that's right. - daniel so are there
genes that predispose certain kinds of things, but there's a lot of other
attenuating factors and whatever? totally.
- zubin yeah. [4881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4881.592s)

- daniel that's what
i think with regard, i think that the anxiety, the
depression, the narcissism, the short attention spans, i think those are all conditionable, and i think they're
conditionable where, you know, i like to look at positive
deviance culturally, like where a whole culture
for some period of time had one, or two standard deviations more of some desirable trait. [4907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4907.341s)

so i like to look at
jains for nonviolence, or buddhists, or quakers,
and be able to see can you have a whole population, which means all the genetic
mutation within that population, and all the kind of variance, but where the population as a
whole its median violence is a standard deviation better
than everybody else's? - zubin so there's a group dynamic- - daniel which means
that culture, right, actually was able to, with
factoring genetics, whatever, [4928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4928.128s)

attenuate that a lot, and the same as across very
different environments, do jews usually educate their kids better than a lot of other cultures do, and reach higher level of education? it's very clear there's a cultural effect that does that thing, right? and so, then you start to think about could you have something
that had buddhist nonviolence and jewish education and
whatever types of processes [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4952.057s)

in terms of could you have a culture that was developing the, you know, a different
set of traits in people that made a different set of
civilization possibilities associated with a increased
post-cynical possibility? now, of course, we're
also looking at the fact that the technology is
developing people itself. as we were saying, just simply the, simply the infinite scroll
personalized to me type thing is going to have effects
on attention span. [4979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4979.91s)

it's gonna have effects, and having an effect on
attention span also means it's gonna make me more
one marshmallow everywhere, including offline.
- zubin mmm-hmm. - daniel because i don't have delayed gratification built-in. and-
- zubin we see that now- - daniel it means democracy will end, because democracy requires a
long enough attention span, a long enough working
memory that i can hear [4999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=4999.323s)

someone's perspective,
hear multiple perspectives, hold them all in working memory, and try i to find a proposition that would meet many
of their goals, right? like if i really wanna be able to do [[collective intelligence]]
well, it requires that, which is why, you know,
marshall mcluhan showed that not only did the
printing press occur as, and the written word being
accessible to everybody, everybody could get a newspaper, [5019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5019.076s)

so you didn't need a
specialized knowledge class that had access, and everyone
could get textbooks and read, not only was the printing
press a prerequisite for democracy, but the written word as the primary type of
media was probably required for democracy to work, because it required people
to think well enough that they could communicate
in writing in long form in a way that could then
translate to legal code, right, to really think through things formally, [5041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5041.923s)

and that they were reading, which meant increased attention span of non-dopaminergic stuff, which also meant enough
working memory to hear multiple perspectives, to
be able to find something that might work, come up
with a good proposition. - zubin it's like the hamilton
era where you, you know, they would write these big treatises, and they would argue in
like 20 pages of text, and it was beautiful prose, [5060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5060.784s)

and extremely, compellingly well-written, and persuasion and knowledge
transfer all happened there, as opposed to, say, what now, where it's a political
statement on [[social media]] with like, dislike, anger that is designed to inflame rather than
necessarily educate. - daniel i mean, you're
one of the very few public intellectuals i know who has publicly changed a position. (zubin laughs)
- zubin okay, first of all, [5083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5083.558s)

i take offense to the term
intellectual, all right? i'm dumb as a rock. number next, yeah, i've done that. - daniel yeah. - zubin i continue to do that, actually. - daniel yeah, it's super important. but you can't have democratic
process have any effectiveness if people don't change positions, right? - zubin yeah. - daniel 'cause then,
otherwise, what you end up getting [5102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5102.027s)

is voting on a binary, right? one candidate, or another, or
yes, or no on a proposition, inherently polarizing the population, because what the proposition has created that benefits one thing, but
it leaves some other stuff out, or harms something else. so the thing that you want that's gonna help your
kids' lives be better, but it's gonna fuck up the
environment i care about, now we're actually caught [5121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5121.716s)

in a seemingly existential
situation against each other. all the energy goes to infighting. i have to be able to find
out what you care about and craft a proposition
that will actually be a better synergistic satisfier and communicate to you
in a compelling way. otherwise, democracy's
gonna decay fairly quickly into this kind of situation. - zubin and i think we're- - daniel which means
the ability to upgrade [5139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5139.346s)

my own position with new information, the ability to model your position well, the ability to try to take a new position that's informed by yours
that i didn't have before. (zubin laughs) - zubin so basically, the punchline is what we're doing now with technology, or what's being done, what's happening, is eroding the very
foundations of our ability to be an effective democracy, [5160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5160.193s)

whereas is it affecting, say, an autocracy, like china, in the same way? - daniel well, we know they
controlled their internet, because they were aware of this, right? they knew the like, so the idea that both education and independent media were prerequisites for democracy was clear from the beginning of modern democracies, right, the idea that an independent
[[fourth estate]] was actually requisite for an educated population. so education means that
they have enough history and background knowledge
and logical process that they can process information well, and the newspaper meant
they're continuously informed. the idea that we can all get
base facts on a situation in common, then we can
disagree what to do with them, or how to interpret them, but we have some shared
base reality to agree on was obviously requisite for
something like democratic process [5210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5210.443s)

that we've thought about it. so you can think about the engagement-based personalized newsfeed as not just breaking the [[fourth estate]], but being an anti-[[fourth estate]]. it's really doing the
exact opposite thing, because a trump follower in florida and a bernie follower in portland, their newsfeeds might not have a single piece of news in common- [5234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5234.297s)

- zubin not a bit-
- daniel but they're all gonna cover covid, and [[climate change]], and the ukraine, and everything, right? they're gonna cover everything, but with the most opposite valence. the only version of the other they'll get is a straw man version.
- zubin right. - daniel and they will see so much news that conforms to their idea that it looks like everybody smart agrees, [5250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5250.506s)

and only ridiculous people
are on the other side, and the social network
curates for people that are, you know, similarly
agreeing on their side. so you get that kind of
confirmation process. can you run a democracy
in a situation where, and like, okay, so remember
how i was saying there was, i wanted to mention why [[social media]] is a different kind of tech. it's its own unique class. i would say anything that creates [5272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5272.314s)

natural network-based monopolies, metcalfe law-mediated monopolies, and that's important, right? there's a reason we didn't
like monopolies before is because you get unchecked power. our whole system was like let, unchecked power becomes fucked up. people don't deal with it well, so let's try to create as many checks and balances on power as we can. [5290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5290.331s)

we're leaving the kingdom for that reason to try to make a more democratic union. and so, the state, and the church, and the market will all be kind
of separate and interacting. that's a check and balance
on power by itself. there won't be one state religion. all the churches get to kind
of compete with each other for the minds and hearts of people. the market means all the
businesses compete with each other, and the state has three branches, [5315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5315.649s)

and the three branches have checks and balances on power with each other. so we didn't like monopolies, 'cause you could have a corporation if that has nothing that
can compete with it that, and people start to need
the thing that it produces, that, obviously, can now start to be, abuse the power, become corrupt, and it was competition that
kept it from being able to do that, kind of
basic market theory idea. [5336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5336.478s)

well, typically, the only
way to get a monopoly was to do some activity, where
you were forcibly crushing the competition through
some kind of, you know, fucked up practices, or
you got the government to grant you unique access
rights, or whatever. so there's a bunch of
antitrust law stuff to prevent that stuff from happening. but with [[network dynamics]] that specifically the
internet made possible, a natural type of monopoly emerged [5360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5360.084s)

that was totally different in its process. it didn't require those
same fucked up processes, and yet you still get
the function of something that doesn't have competition
checking it, right? so metcalfe's law basically says for something where the value
of the thing is proportional, the value of the thing involves
user-generated activity, and the more users that are involved, the more valuable it is. it's not just linearly more valuable. [5380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5380.676s)

it's second power more valuable. and so, a currency that
only a few people use is not that valuable, 'cause
i don't want a currency where i have to have 50
different currencies in my wallet for the different stores that
all take different currencies. one currency that's usable everywhere, like a monopoly on money,
which kind of the fed is, was, there was a very high use value in that. similarly, on facebook, every fuckin' person i know is there. [5402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5402.071s)

i don't want 30 different social networks, where i have to have 30 different logins for different groups of people, and i can buy everything i want on amazon, and i can find everything
i want on google, right? so when you have a network type dynamic where the more stuff you
have, the more value you have, and as a second power, once you get up to a certain percentage of
the population involved, you reach an escape velocity, [5422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5422.835s)

where you will become a monopoly, and you'll have one search engine that has radically more dominance than all the other search
engines, one online store, one social network that has radically more within its vertical. and you might get something
that can get a lot of dominance, but in a slightly different vertical, like twitter relative to facebook, but it's a different media type. [5440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5440.485s)

- zubin right. - daniel and so, that
creates natural monopolies we don't currently have a way to check, and at huge scale
intrinsic to the process. it's at a huge scale of
social influence, right? facebook and google both
have like 3 billion people, which is the population
of china, and russia, and the us, and iran combined. - zubin they're bigger
than [[nation state|nation states]]. - daniel bigger than all the biggest [5463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5463.294s)

[[nation state|nation states]] combined. and so, you're like, "okay,
that's fuckin' huge deal." there were no corporations that had that kind of thing before. and if it is customizing
what they're exposed to with personalized data
and ai optimization, so that combination of things, so the amazon recommendations
are doing that, and google is doing that,
youtube is doing that, facebook's doing that, [5484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5484.886s)

then what we have is we
have a massive scale, right, maybe trillion dollar,
maybe multi-billion person, massive scale population personal data, ai-optimized behavior mod system with no checks and balances
on the power of it. (zubin laughs) that's not like a company the way adam smith thought of companies. - zubin right. - daniel and when you take that [5507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5507.831s)

if it has an ad model, where the more time people are spending on
site, and the more engaged, the better the ad revenue's gonna do, and it has a fiduciary response way to maximize value to the shareholders, so it has to keep optimizing that thing, the ai's gonna optimize for engagement, and the one-marshmallow sticky shit is just more engaging, right? because otherwise, i don't
plan my day, and say, [5530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5530.168s)

"i wanna spend seven hours
upset scrolling facebook." i say, "fuck, i don't wanna
spend any time on facebook. "i'm just gonna check it real
quick," and then i get stuck, because something that
was hypernormal enough brought me into a rabbit
hole that obscured my prefrontal assessment
of the amount of time i don't wanna spend on facebook, right? - zubin you got hijacked. - daniel i got hijacked.
- zubin yeah. - daniel and so, it does
not have the incentive [5549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5549.393s)

to keep me intentional. it has the incentive to
capture my intention, right? and so, if you have
something that does that, it's going to increase all limbic process, so
outrage, and addiction, and et cetera, which also
includes polarization, and tribal identities, and
certainty, and sanctimony, right? it's gonna increase all those things. so it'll double down on
bias, rather than undo bias. it'll double down on tribal
in-group kind of stuff, [5579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5579.946s)

and shorten the attention span, so you couldn't even listen long enough to hear a counter perspective. and it wouldn't be dopaminergic enough to maintain the attention span. so that can't not polarize the population. and so, china was smart to be like, "no, fuck it, we're not
gonna let that thing emerge. "it'll ruin our nation." and so, so if you polarize the population with increased certainty, outrage, everybody thinks their thing
is an [[existential risk]], if trump gets elected,
it's the end of america, if trump doesn't get elected,
it's the end of america, whatever, right, then they, the people will select more
polarized representatives. the more polarized
representatives in congress and senate like that can't
cooperate with each other at all, so everything gets gridlocked. [5627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5627.223s)

everybody filibusters
each other, and whatever. an increased gridlock system
can get slower and slower, and more and more expensive
capacity to regulate tech that is moving faster and faster. and if the regulatory system
has slower feedback loops than the thing it's trying to regulate, it will just lose the
ability to regulate it. and so, a tech that
polarizes the population, and polarizes the representative class, that creates gridlock, [5654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5654.415s)

that decreases the capacity of governance, will make that governmental system lose to another system that doesn't
have those problems going on that doesn't have all of its
energy going to infighting, that doesn't have gridlock in its decision-making process, and- - zubin has a longer term outlook, too. - daniel it has a longer term outlook, because you don't think that in four years everything you did will get undone. [5672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5672.249s)

- zubin yeah. - daniel and so, in the same way that the printing press
kind of ended feudalism and started to make
modern democracy possible, this tech is kind of ending
democracy as we know it, and orienting towards authoritarianism, unless we start to redesign it in a fundamentally different way. - zubin okay. anybody who hears that, [5693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5693.437s)

and isn't absolutely terrified
that the actual possibility of complete societal and
democratic decay is real as an [[existential threat]] was not listening to what you just said. and i'll say this, because we've talked, we've interspersed
throughout the conversation what are actual possible solutions, like how do you get to
post-cynical reasoning? how do you get to an
integral level of thinking? how do you have rational discourse, [5716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5716.899s)

and make sense, and have
these sort of commonalities? with [[social media]], and i'll tell you, i've tasted this, because look, i have 2 1/2 million, 3 million if you consider doc vader, too, subscribers on facebook, i don't know, half a million on youtube, i don't know what, half
a million on instagram, so i am complicit in this feedback loop. and yet, here i am saying, you know, [5746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5746.205s)

"this is terrible, we're all gonna die," but there are these interesting, there's these interesting new
emergents that are happening, like little, small
spinoffs, like locals, say, which it has certain values, like we don't, we'd never cancel anybody, we don't censor anybody, the creators set their own communities, they set the tone and the
spirit of what they're doing, and it's pay to comment, so
there's a barrier to entry, [5767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5767.577s)

where you're actually
paying for the product. you're not the product yourself. there's no advertising. and i'm on that. and the difference in tone,
in post-cynical thinking between facebook, where i have people who also are in a supporter tribe, and they pay to be there, too, and that place, where the whole structure of it is different, it's
a different application [5793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5793.12s)

of the technology, is night and day, and people who are in
both places will tell you, "yeah, there's no competition." people are more, they're more collegial, they have different opinions. i don't have to moderate at all, even though people get to
post whatever they want. so is it just a question
of intelligent design of this stuff that's looking
at the outcomes we want, even though we can't really always predict [5815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5815.881s)

what the second-order and
third-order effects are? - daniel yeah, so this
gets us back to the idea that we make environments that
are in turn conditioning us. and yet, we're not necessarily
being very intentional about all the ways that
they're gonna condition us. we're making those
environments for usually some very narrowly defined purpose, and usually some profit purpose. - zubin one-marshmallow tricks, yeah. - daniel and so, everybody familiar with
broken windows theorem? - zubin probably not. - daniel so environmental psychology, it just has a huge effect. you take a ghetto area, where you got spray paint,
and trash, and broken windows, and you just simply
replace the broken windows, clean up the graffiti, and trash, and the crime drops
something like 50% instantly. and you take an area that's good, [5868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5868.538s)

the windows break, some graffiti comes, you don't clean it up, and
crime boosts almost instantly. this is the same people, same
genetics, same neurobiology, same whatever, who are more,
or less likely to be criminals simply based on what they're observing on if the windows are broken, or not. this is pretty fundamental type of stuff, because, of course, one is
signaling this is a place that nobody cares about, this
is a lawless place, whatever, the other signaling something different. [5893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5893.671s)

that's just the beginning to the field of environmental psych, and the way that environments affect us, and you walk into a cathedral, and the technology of the cathedral has an effect. like you look up, and when
you look up, you feel small, and you have some sense of
vastness that starts to come. and you know, even just, you know, i was mentioning [5915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5915.568s)

that the volatile organic
compounds built into the paint and the carpet are subclinical
toxins that, you know, like the formaldehydes,
the organophosphates. we did not even evolve
to process these things. - zubin right, they didn't exist. - daniel they were not
part of what our liver and kidneys were supposed to deal with. so that's a way that we built
for a very specific purpose, or we started putting fungicides in paints to prevent internal mold that then started [5940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5940.517s)

to also make mutated species
of molds, and whatever. we were designing the paint for
some very specific purposes, but it produced second
and third-order effects we weren't paying attention to. but even low ceilings, whereas, you know, tribal people
that mostly lived outside, you looked up a whole lot more, there's neurology to looking up, right? it actually stimulates different
types of cognitive process- - zubin yeah.
- daniel to have your head [5961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5961.864s)

and your eyes go up. so the cathedral knows that, puts things up there on purpose that stimulates a certain kind of process. so that's like
environmental design, right, environmental psych applied
to environmental design. the term ontological design is wherein we're designing environments that are in turn affecting
our own future ontologies, our own future experience of the world, [5979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=5979.773s)

beliefs, ways of being, et cetera. and so, i think most people know that if you have experienced, if you're in an old growth forest, or if you're in a beautiful temple, or if you're in a ghetto, you feel different
instantly just simply based on the nature of the environment, the lighting, all those things, digital environments even more so, right? [6000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6000.905s)

because digital environments
can be so extremely different, have such extreme personalization, and reward dynamics, and
all those types of things. and people are spending more of their time in digital environments that
we're obviously not adapted to, and that are designed for are
mostly extractive purposes regarding you, rather than developing you in positive kind of ways. so if you think about the like, okay, okay, the first part is
to say tech is affecting [6028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6028.402s)

our value systems and our experience of what it means to be people
individually and collectively. tech is not values agnostic. that's the first kind of construction, and i'll come back to this other part. tech is not values agnostic. if you read marvin harris,
"cultural materialism," it's a, you know, a very empirical school of cultural anthropology
that basically says the changes in our [[social system|social systems]], and even the changes in
our religion, and culture, were usually proceeded by changes in tech that coded for certain
patterns of behavior that coded for certain value systems that were associated, so- - zubin the plow, for example, yeah- - daniel you wanna give that one? - zubin so you know, people used to, this is a fascinating one,
and god, this, you know, this is central to our
experience as humans, [6068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6068.417s)

and experience in healthcare, like taking care of sick people. we don't, we pull them out. we left-brain yank them
out of their context into a room that's cold and sterile, and we say, "here's what wrong with you "based on these extracted tests," whereas where we've totally
decontextualized these humans. anyway, so back to this plow. pre-plow, [6090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6090.753s)

societies tended to be very interesting. they had maternal female gods. they had this kind of idea that women would actually do a
lot of the farming and stuff, because they could, and
the guys would go out, and do hunter gathering,
and things like that, and it played to their
strengths at the time. then the plow gets invented, and this, here's the technological thing. now, several things happen. [6113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6113.969s)

first of all, you can use
an animal to pull the plow, which now changes the theology and the animism around
our worship of animals, 'cause now if you make an animal, if you elevate an animal to
some sort of godlike creature, and you're forcing it
to do this manual labor, well, that doesn't really vibe. so now, mm-mm, the entire culture
shifts to where it's like, "no, god gave man the
dominion over animals, "and so now, use it as you will." [6137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6137.433s)

it's less than a sacred thing in itself. and women now in order to
man sort of things like plows and things like that, it becomes
very physically demanding. they would have miscarriages, et cetera. so now it became disadvantageous for women to do the farming, so they ended up then
taking different roles, which then changed the, because the production of food
is associated with deities, et cetera, now you have
male-dominated type gods. [6160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6160.146s)

and so, the entire course
of civilization changes from an invention, and
these are spiritual changes, these are emotional changes,
these are social changes, and they're technological changes, and they all interact in this web. it's fascinating. - daniel obviously, the
plow gave surplus in a way that we didn't have before,
which was really key, because now you can have grains, and in a gathering environment,
grains are not that useful. [6182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6182.254s)

you gotta have a lot of
grain to be really useful. so the combo of the plow
and the basket means now we can have really
meaningful caloric surplus, so we can also grow our
population much faster, and we can make it through famines, and we can start to have
concentrated wealth. as a result of that, ownership
starts to mean something, and property rights
start to mean something, and then class systems start to emerge, and then civilization
structures to be able to deal [6203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6203.499s)

with class systems start to emerge, and then if you own
stuff, then inheritance, and so, then the formalizing of marriage, and the changing of those
contracts to be able to have paternity certainty
associated with the inheritance of the stuff, like all of those things follow that kind of tech, right? - zubin and that's a plow! - daniel yeah-
- zubin that's a plow. - daniel so then, i would say, [6224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6224.219s)

and of course, the history
of this is actually a million times more nuanced. i just want people to get the
gist of the kind of thing. but the animism is just
such a great example. i can bow and arrow kill a bison, and still pray to the spirit of the bison, and say, "when i die, i wanna
become soil that becomes grass "for the grandchild of this bison, "and be a part of the great
web of life," and everything. but i can't take the bison, [6248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6248.237s)

and hybridize it into an ox, yoke it, cut its balls off, and beat it all day long to pull the plow, and still believe in the
spirit of the buffalo, right? and so, to use a plow require, like the plow codes a pattern of behavior, which is beating an ox all day long, and that requires a
change of value system. and yet, the tribe that doesn't do that is just going to lose, because they have [6274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6274.654s)

so much less caloric surplus and whatever than the
tribe that does that. so this is an example
of how the tools change the value systems. there are other examples where you can make value system changes independent of tools
that will in turn change how we use the tools, like the sabbath was kind
of a social technology for how do we not use the
tools for some period of time, [6291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6291.545s)

not to be hijacked by productivity, orient towards the value
system in each other, to make sure that we're in
turn directing those things. - zubin ah. - daniel that's one
way of thinking about it. so we have to actually get this direction of developing culture to bind the tech and inform the [[social structure|social structures]]. but you can also build tech that in knowing that the
tech is going to influence [6315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6315.083s)

the psychology, the values, and
the behaviors of the people, that should be intentionally
factored in the design process. so then both the design of facebook, the design of the monetary system, the design of the anthropocene, the design of the
paints, and the building, and all those things, you'd say if in addition to whatever it does, right, it's supposed to answer phone calls, it's supposed to be able to
give me access to information, [6338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6338.649s)

it's supposed to be able to keep rain off, in addition to that, it's also affecting the psychological, physiological, relational health and dispositions of the people. so we say the number one design constraint of all the tech has to be that the ontologic design effect
it has is enlightening to the people that it's
interacting with, right? so how do you, then the
ontologic design question, [6362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6362.86s)

how do you rebuild
civilization from scratch? how do we rebuild the technosphere and anthropocene from scratch
to maximally enlighten the people that are within it, right? so both increasing their own
health, happiness, well-being, and their sense-making, meaning-making, choice-making capacities
for collective well-being. i think that when you start to realize it doesn't take everybody having a deeper understanding of these things [6389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6389.056s)

for them to start
designing tech differently that will start to affect everyone. obviously, it took not that
many people to build facebook that then started to
affect 3 billion people, and as a result, also everybody, right, because in that effect it
was on broadcast media, and culture, and what the us government, and military, and economy is doing, and it wouldn't take that
many people to build something that was more protopic in the nature [6408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6408.495s)

of what the tech influenced
people to do behaviorally. and so, yeah, that is one
of the sources of optimism. - zubin yeah, and i'm actually, it's tricky, because
threading the needle requires the optimism that it can be done. and i think it can be done,
but as you've said before, i think the narrowing of the window through which we thread
this needle to avoid existential catastrophic
civilization-terminating issues, whereas, you know, if
you look at the cosmos, [6438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6438.63s)

and go, "why are aliens not here?" of course, this is very simplification. is there a great filter out there, where civilizations all
go through this procedure of narrowing and narrowing and narrowing until poof, most of 'em don't make it, and are we gonna be one of those? so it's not, you know, i think adyashanti, who's a kind of a spiritual
leader guy, has said the entire universe could
blink out of existence, [6461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6461.172s)

and the true fundamental
nature of the universe, the true reality, wouldn't even notice. and so, this hubris that
somehow how we're special and can survive i think
is not quite right. so part of it is a more thoughtful design. part of it is group sense-making, i think, of like how are we going to, what do we value? what matters to us? you mentioned the sabbath, [6483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6483.732s)

which i think is very interesting. my family and i, and i
have done videos on this, do a thing called screen-free sunday, where we turn off all the devices, and we open up to each other again, and we're very present, and so on, and even my kids don't have
[[social media]], or any of that, but they do use devices for other things. and it's been transformative for us, even that one day-
- daniel right. [6503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6503.051s)

- zubin and i went on a
meditation retreat recently, six days, where i was
completely unplugged, and i'll tell you, if we think we've permanently damaged
ourself, we're wrong. - daniel yeah.
- zubin because i've never, i mean, i was wide open,
connected, feeling love for people, and when i came back
and did a couple shows, it was actually against
my will to some degree. but when i did it, you
could see those shows. like it's a different me. [6523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6523.752s)

i'm like, "guys, let's really "just try to connect this together." and i think that's doable. i think it is, but it
takes some collective will. - daniel i have a colleague zak stein, who helped build a system
called lectica that is one way of assessing a certain kind of human development, the complexity of
someone's thinking process. and they're able to kind of
look at someone's writing [6551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6551.678s)

of certain types, and be
able to assess the complexity and nuance in their thinking, and made progress in being able to do that with machine learning and
natural language processing. so, and what that would mean, the complexity and nuance
of thinking, is the ability to take lots of different perspectives, the ability to notice
bias and error in those, the ability to notice ways of synthesizing [6579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6579.899s)

and finding higher order reconciliation. so let's say, for instance, and this is really just,
i'm throwing this out as a suggestive way of where something could go, not that this is the exact proposition. so let's say we built
a facebook-like thing that had lots of
different types of content that were being personalized
to the individual, but that didn't have a business model [6604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6604.65s)

that required ads to do it, so it had a different
basis of optimization, wasn't trying to maximize time on site, or engagement in that way. let's say that the thing it
was trying to maximize was your lectical score.
- zubin hmm. - daniel and so, it was looking at where you were typing in responses, and your general engagement, and it was wanting to
see that your ability to, [6624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6624.859s)

and your disposition to seek and steel man more perspectives, and have more nuanced perspectives, more ability to orient towards empiricism where
it was relevant, et cetera, that those were the things
it was optimizing for, and it was curating content to you both based on what would be outside of what you were already exposed to, but also in the zone
of proximal development [6648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6648.099s)

that you could grasp it. and again, empirically
upregulating in that way, that would produce really
different results, right? you could be growing attention span, rather than decreasing it. you could be growing multi-perspective, multi-perspectival kind of capacity through the nature of what that ai pointed at your brain is optimizing for. - zubin okay, i think
that's a doable thing. [6671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6671.499s)

it would depend on the,
again, like you said, what are you optimizing for
in terms of also incentives? like facebook went viral,
because it's hacking into the capitalist incentive
of this is how you make money through ads, and so on, and it just became self-replicating that way. but like sometimes, youtube's
algorithm will do that. it's quite remarkable. it will actually point, and i get this, and this is why, because people who, [6695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6695.136s)

i do some meditation,
awakening type content, consciousness content, and
youtube's algorithm seems to feed that content to people who have a vague interest in it, but also may overlap
slightly with healthcare. it kind of knows this in some way, and people will message me, and go, "i don't know what, i don't
know, i never knew who you were, "but i'm a nurse, and i've been having "this existential crisis,
and i found your piece on," [6720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6720.307s)

whatever, "donald hoffman,
and then it went me, "then youtube fed me a
rabbit hole of your stuff, "and i'm so much better for it, "because now i'm interested in this, "and i went to a retreat, and i did this." so you can see the virtuous stuff happen. so the question then that you bring up is can it be optimized actually in a way that that's the endpoint
you're actually looking for, that lectical score that
zak stein, you said, [6741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6741.967s)

is working on in development.
- daniel yeah. zak could be a great guy
to have on your show- - zubin we'll have to do it.
- daniel to discuss it. tristan would be a great
guy to have on your show, because youtube made some adjustments based on some of the
criticism that happened, and i don't, he knows this
topic much better than i do in terms of where adjustments were made, and where things have
actually progressed, and- - zubin i'd love to hear that. [6762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6762.049s)

- daniel and where
they could progress more. and i can, like there are reasons that you don't wanna
optimize for lectical score. that's why i said it's just
the beginning of a thinking, because if a lectical
score is the only thing you optimize for, someone who has more
advanced theory of mind- - zubin yeah.
- daniel without necessarily more advanced compassion, or embodiment, can be a more effective sociopath- [6783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6783.022s)

- zubin psychopath, yeah.
- daniel yeah. - zubin exactly. - daniel and so, i don't think you want to optimize for anything measurable, right? the thing that is measurable
will have externalities. even a weighted algorithm of
n measurable things will have stuff that's really important
that's not included in it that if you're optimizing for you'll end up having the externality. [6805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6805.321s)

so you can optimize,
but you want a process that what you're optimizing for is itself being continuously iterated. - zubin a recursive process with the optimization parameters. - daniel where the externalities
of what's being harmed by the optimization are
continuously being internalized. but that means you also
need a governance system that can do that, which
means you can't be bound to something like fiduciary responsibility [6824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6824.774s)

for profit maximization. - zubin okay, okay, so
to internalize the harms that are being generated, man, that requires a whole different
way of doing things, right? because if the fossil fuel
industry had to internalize the environmental harm of their actions, it would be a very different industry. i mean, how do you even begin
to think about doing that? - daniel i mean, it's interesting. you'd actually have to
have a process to do that, [6848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6848.424s)

because if you mandated today that the fossil fuels
industry had to internalize all of the costs it externalized, the civilization would collapse overnight. (zubin laughs)
- zubin yeah, yeah. - daniel because-
- zubin there'd be no energy. - daniel there'd be no energy, because the energy's just
priced at how much it costs us to extract it-
- zubin right. [6866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6866.688s)

- daniel and then a
little margin to sell it. - zubin right, not the
common costs of the harm. - daniel not the costs that
took nature to produce it, or that it would take for
us to be able to produce it through some other method, and then the environmental
harm, social harms, whatever that happened. if i wanted to be able to
pay for all of those things, probably my cell phone is $10,000. - zubin yeah.
- daniel right? - zubin yeah.
- daniel and so, there's a huge amount
of externalized costs, and energy is really
fundamental in this one. but that is a [[perverse incentive]], right? there's a fundamental [[perverse incentive]]. so you would want to be able
to identify those externalities and internalize them where, and what that would do is
it would bind the incentive of the agent with the well-being
of the commons, right, that the company only got better [6911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6911.2s)

when it was doing things that
were comprehensively better for the world, not got better
while fucking the world in different ways.
- zubin yeah. - daniel so how do you
internalize externality, and make, and close
[[perverse incentive]] niches is one of the fundamental things humanity has us to get better at, right? like we have to fundamentally change our socioeconomic systems to do [[perverse incentive]] minimizing
much better than they do. how to do that is a complex topic, but- - zubin hmm, and how
much of this do you think is gonna require new technology that enables this kind of thing? like you said, like what zak is working on with the machine learning
that can generate these lectical scores, versus how much of it is more related to your sabbath point, which is- - daniel that's a technology. [6960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6960.277s)

depending upon how you
wanna think of it, right? - zubin yeah. - daniel that's a social technology in the same way that whether
it's institutional marriage, or whether it's tribal council, or whether it's, you know, sabbath, it's basically that is a technique. - zubin right, right, right, right- - daniel that can be, that
also requires abstraction to understand why it's an important thing, [6981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6981.4s)

and that can be taught and passed down. - zubin right. - daniel so i think when
i say social technology, i'm not referring to things like facebook. i'm referring to things like sweat lodges-
- zubin right, so that's what i was, that's what i was getting at. does it require that sort of technology, meaning self-awareness, self-realization, [6999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=6999.505s)

self-improvement technologies, like sweat lodges, psychedelics,
guided psychedelic therapy, meditation, spirituality of
any kind, that sort of thing? do you think that's necessary
for humanity to survive? - daniel just you'll appreciate this. the first time i got to do a sweat lodge, i was invited to do it on a reservation. the shaman leading it,
there was one point where, it was my first time there. there was another white guy there [7035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7035.021s)

whose first time it was, who, about 3/4 of the way through,
freaked out at the heat, and kind of ran outta the thing screaming. and the old shaman was
sitting right next to me, and he whispered in my ear. he says, "we never trust someone "who would bail on the sweat lodge." - zubin oh! - daniel "because if he's
so scared that it's bad, "that this is too hot for humans, [7058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7058.882s)

"he just left us all in here." - zubin oh!
(zubin laughs) - daniel and so,
either he really doesn't, he really knows it's safe,
and he can't control his mind- - zubin yeah.
- daniel or he doesn't think it's safe, and he was
willing to save himself, and bail on everybody.
- zubin wow. - daniel so you could see
there was a social technology- - zubin yeah, yeah, yeah-
- daniel right, where it's gonna get hot
enough that you know, [7077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7077.386s)

because the guys who've
been doing it before of generation, generation,
you know intellectually it's not gonna hurt you, but
it's gonna get hot enough that it feels like it's gonna hurt you. - zubin yeah.
- daniel which means that you have to watch that
fear and not succumb to it. - zubin yeah. - daniel and you're all in it together, and you are experiencing
a shared hormesis, right? like you're overcoming
some difficult thing, [7095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7095.171s)

but all together. there's also, there's
a million other aspects that we can be like oh, wow, there was a really fuckin' potent, insightful thing-
- zubin yeah. - daniel that they figured out that we have not replaced, right? we've lost a lot of those things, and we don't have replacements, and whether it was that, or you know, [7110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7110.296s)

we could go into all the
types of rites of passage and tribal technologies, but
they weren't for no reason, and they weren't just frivolous. they serve fundamental roles
to the social coherence. - zubin it's funny because,
you know, when i was younger, i was much more of a
scientific reductionist. i thought pretty much
everything could be boiled down to processes that are
explicable in the third person, and its sort of domain, and rituals like that, i always thought, [7136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7136.812s)

including religion, including
cathedrals, including, "what a waste of money. "why are we doing this? "these are dumb," even marriages,
like this whole ceremony, like, "let's just go
have a civil ceremony. "this is just dumb." boy, was i completely wrong. the older i get, the more i realize these are crucial interwoven fabrics of human development
and social development [7156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7156.212s)

and all the things you just said. so, and again, i constantly talk about this meditation retreat,
because it's the most, it's the easiest thing i can talk about, it's the most recent. this idea that you get 30 people together, there was a small group, and a lot of them were my
supporters on the show, but they'd been drawn to it, because they feel the
call to do this thing, [7175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7175.223s)

and this guy, angelo
dilullo, who's a physician who wrote this book actually, "awake," about enlightenment, awakening, and it's really kind of a
zen-influenced kind of thing, and long story short, we went there, didn't know what to expect, silence, but in the evening
we would do group activities, and those group activities
were, everyone was reluctant. they're like, "what, we're
gonna do improv comedy? "we're gonna do what? [7196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7196.029s)

"this kind of circling and
storytelling and emotion work?" it was the most connected,
open, amazing experience, and it pulls into the real world, kind of like i went to whole foods to order a slice of pizza, and i was so, i felt so connected to
the guy making the pizza who was having, looked like
he was having a bad day, that he could feel that energy. i mean, there was like this
nonverbal communication that happens, and he just
gave me the biggest slice. [7220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7220.517s)

he's like, "hey, thanks,"
and i'm like, "thank you!" i mean, this crazy,
stupid, intangible stuff that sounds woo-woo, but
it's absolutely real. so that's why i ask like how important is that sort of technology, you know? - daniel so it's critical,
and it's not like you- - zubin 'cause we've
lost it to some degree. - daniel totally. it's necessary, but it's not sufficient if
we were to still be making [7248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7248.644s)

physical tech that is also
conditioning human psyche and values and conferring power
that was doing the opposite, but with [[exponential tech]] influence scale- - zubin push and pull. - daniel so we have to be designing the tech differently on the physical side, designing the incentive systems and the deterrent systems differently, and working at the purely psychospiritual, cognitive culture level. [7276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7276.123s)

and so, if you think about
the way marvin harris talked about society, or any
civilization being a function of three interacting things, you have an infrastructure,
a [[social structure]], and a [[superstructure]]. the infrastructure is the physical tech that mediates our physical needs and relationship with the physical world, so water, food,
transportation, production, waste management, all that kind of stuff, [7299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7299.58s)

and obviously, all of the technosphere. the [[social system]] is basically the collective agreement field, so government, law, economics. the [[superstructure]] is kind like culture. it's like what is the good life that we're ordinating towards? what is the existential
reason for any of it? what is the ethical basis? and so, we can see that
religion has become [7323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7323.925s)

pretty hollowed out. we can see that patriotism,
that most of the things that bound someone to
more than themselves, and maybe just their immediate family, are pretty hollowed out. and they're replaced with, you know, you talk about kind of the quasi-religions that are where people have
some kind of tribal identity that feels like it's associated to some preventing the rapture, [7344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7344.033s)

and making some kind of
better heaven on earth, or whatever possible, but
they're shitty religions, right? the new ones are fairly poorly
designed for the purposes. (zubin laughs)
- zubin right. - daniel but while harris argued that infrastructure drives
changes in [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]], there
are other social philosophers who will argue why each one
has causal arrows pointing in the other directions,
and it's all true. so what we could say is how to make [7373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7373.699s)

a fundamentally viable
civilization requires a certain amount of changes
in all three simultaneously that lead to a virtuous process. now, my [[social system|social systems]], let's just go ahead and
take government as a basis, or you know, governing institutions, 'cause the market will
create a bunch of incentives, but it'll have incentives
to do some things that suck for the whole,
which is why we have the idea of rule of law that we
can collectively say no, [7403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7403.488s)

we don't wanna cut all the trees down. we want national forests, or we don't want organ
markets, or whatever it is. so we'll make a law around that thing, and then we'll give something
like monopoly of violence to be able to enshrine rule
of law and do enforcement. so that's able to basically
bind market and tech. it's not anymore, right? it's been hollowed out in a
way where it really can't, and that's important. [7427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7427.948s)

but if that is not derived, that [[social structure]] that is designed to guide the infrastructure
and the power of it, if that [[social structure]] isn't derived from the [[superstructure]], right, which is that the consent of the govern is where the power of the
government comes from, that it is a government of, for, and by a comprehensively
educated citizenry, then it will be authoritarian. [7450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7450.653s)

and so, either you don't get institutions that can manage the complexity,
and you get catastrophes, or you do get institutions
that can manage the complexity, and they create order through imposition, and they're oppressive. so you either get
catastrophes on one side, or dystopias on the other,
or you have to actually have a culture that is
developing the capacity to make sense of the world individually and together to meaning-make
the world individually [7479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7479.619s)

and together to be able to
do choice-making individually and together, so that a
comprehensively educated, informed, capable of post-cynical, good faith communication
population engaging with each other can create and oversight
and watchdog institutions that have the capacity to
engage and bind the technology, so that we are safe stewards for the power of exponential technology. - zubin all of those things
have to kind of happen. that's the thing, they have to happen [7510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7510.042s)

interwoven, interpenetrating. it can't just be one, or the other, and again, i feel like, you know, i'm gonna quote iain mcgilchrist, who's written a book,
"master and his emissary," about the difference between
the right and the left brain and how the left brain
really as the emissary that now thinks it's the master really loves to take parts and work on parts and make
wholes out of the parts [7530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7530.495s)

instead of looking at a whole, whereas the right brain is silent, doesn't really use direct language, but it sees things relationally,
and interwoven, and so on. and as civilizations start to progress, it seems they shift to a more
bureaucratic, left-brain, kind of absolute certainty,
reductionism, et cetera, and i worry that unless we can
reintegrate with the right, you know, form a kind of corpus callosum that connects the two, we are gonna fail [7560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7560.152s)

at this avoiding [[dystopia]], or
avoiding [[catastrophic risk]]. i mean, i'm curious your thoughts on that. - daniel if people haven't seen 'em, everybody should watch the dialogues between david bohm and krishnamurti. - zubin oh, wow. - daniel some of my most
favorite dialogues ever, and david bohm is talking about "wholeness and the implicate order" and why it is a fragment, and you know, [7588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7588.93s)

if people don't know, one of the top physicists who advanced quantum
mechanics following einstein, and, but also a really
deep philosophic thinker. and so, the dialogues between he and krishnamurti were super
interesting on these topics. - zubin i've heard about this. supposed to be remarkable.
- daniel yeah. and krishnamurti was,
of course, always asking what is the fundamental basis of conflict, [7613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7613.232s)

and what would it take
to have a civilization that could actually deal with conflict- - zubin by the way,
who was krishnamurti? maybe fill these guys in, so. - daniel i mean, there's
a whole interesting story of his relationship with
the theosophical society, and like that, but just a very interesting 20th century thinker that
came from what would've seemed like a esoteric spiritual tradition, but was a really, really keen intellect, [7634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7634.904s)

and was really focused on what would a civilization
that could actually deal with conflict well
require in the development of people individually and at scale as our capacity for the consequentiality of conflict is growing, right? post the bomb, it's a different story, because conflict before
had a limited scope of how many people would be harmed. and now, you have a situation [7664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7664.648s)

where conflict can
escalate to kill everybody. - zubin yeah.
- daniel and obviously, that was when you had one
type of [[catastrophe weapon]]. now, with bio-weapons, and ai weapons, and cyber weapons, and drone weapons, we have
way more catastrophic weapons in a much more highly
interconnected, fragile world with a fragile ecosystem
close to [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] with way more actors that have it, where you can't do mutually
assured destruction. [7687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7687.016s)

so if you don't figure out how do we deal with conflict better, so of course, one answer is, well, just ubiquitous
surveillance and control everyone, which is the [[dystopia]] to
avoid the catastrophe. the other answer has to
be a authentically better self-organizing [[collective intelligence]]. and so, this, you know,
krishnamurti was obviously prescient seeing this, and being like, "we actually have to deal with the origins [7711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7711.135s)

"of conflict better." and so, you can get into
marx's ideas of class conflict, and girard's ideas of
mimetic desire, conflict, and you know, you kind of have to go deep on where those come from
to say what would it take to deal with them well-
- zubin right. - daniel but bohm was looking at the orientation of a mind that mostly thinks in words, of western mind, you know, in particular, [7743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7743.133s)

to break reality into parts,
and make sure that our word, the symbol that would
correspond with the ground there corresponded with the things
that it was supposed to, and not the other things, so
try to draw rigorous boundaries to, you know, divide everything up, led to us fundamentally relating to everything as parts first. and so, then you get stuff
that doesn't make sense. like you bring parts together, and there's some new property
that none of the parts have, [7766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7766.007s)

and you have to call it emergence, and it seems kind of wacky, but it was only because
that property was there from the beginning and
you took it into parts- - zubin parts-
- daniel and- - zubin oh, fascinating! so you call it emergence because
you started with the parts, and you built it up, whereas
it was a whole to begin with, and ah, so what was missing,
you're calling emergence. - daniel exactly.
- zubin ah, fascinating. [7784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7784.543s)

(zubin laughs) - daniel and so, whether
you have one country trying to benefit itself at the
expense of another country, or all of the countries
trying to grow their gdp at the expense of the ecosystem, or a proposition that
is benefiting something, but harming something else,
and polarizing the population, or a particular metric
you're trying to optimize for in healthcare that causes
iatrogenic cascades to damaging something else, or whatever, [7808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7808.339s)

the highly interconnected
world where the solution, or what you're optimizing for, is made a narrow subset of everything. the thing that you're doing is still interacting with complexity. so whatever it's affecting
outside of what you're intending to affect will be negative externalities. some people will care about those. they'll respond to those. you'll keep driving conflict,
driving externality. [7826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7826.471s)

with exponential population
and [[exponential tech]], that thing self-terminates. so how do we, we can't do
exponential externality. so you have to do a better
job of not doing externality, which means that the goal
is not to optimize for gdp. it's something broader than gdp. it's not just gdp per capita. okay, we need to add a gini coefficient. yeah, but that doesn't include
personal happiness, whatever, so we need to add a
national happiness index. [7849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7849.282s)

yeah, but that doesn't
include environmental stuff, so we have to add a co2 thing, but that doesn't include nitrogen, so- - zubin parts, parts, parts. - daniel you keep adding, and yet there will always be stuff in some finite set of
metrics you're optimizing for that matter that are outside of that set. - zubin yeah. - daniel so how do you
actually relate to the whole, [7863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7863.786s)

and say the thing we're trying to optimize for is not definable, right? that's what i would say the first verse of the "tao te ching" was about, right? the tao that is speakable
is not the eternal tao, and that's what i would say the no false idols thing was about, that as soon as you say, "the thing we wanna optimize for is x," it's not really it, right? [7883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7883.467s)

that's not. the thing you wanna optimize for is the nature of the sacred. you try and define it, you're gonna fuck it up.
- zubin yeah. - daniel but you can sense
it progressively better. - zubin yes.
- daniel and you can do a lot of defining around it. but if you think your definition is it, that's a false idol-
- zubin i see. [7896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7896.95s)

- daniel and so, how do we,
(zubin laughs) how do we not have metrics that
create optimization systems that then bind us, right, where now the board wants to hold the ceo to quarterly profit metrics to be able to get the money back to the
shareholders who invested, so we create a law for the
fiduciary responsibility for profit maximization. and now, even if you see
there's an externality, [7924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7924.883s)

you can't do anything about it, because you're already bound to the metrics you're optimizing. - zubin yeah.
- daniel so whatever set of metrics that we're optimizing for, we have to be able to
pay attention to things that are outside of those
metrics that matter, and be able to progressively
internalize that, which means we have to
create governance structures that can orient around
the ability to do that. [7939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7939.502s)

- zubin okay. - daniel which also means
we have to create minds that are oriented to do that, and know that other minds will
notice shit that you don't. this is where authentic diversity matters. other minds will notice
shit that you don't, and there's no way to notice
all the things they do, which is why you have to be in dialogue. - zubin okay. okay. so... my field, healthcare, everything you just said points to the root of our dysfunction
in what i call health 2.0, which is our mechanized, reductionist, metric-driven, assembly-line model, medicine as machine is our current model, where we have an electronic health record that's really an apparatus to gather data and optimize processes based on metrics [7979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=7979.919s)

that we've determined by fiat, or by committee, based on incomplete data, and we reduce the human health experience to a series of parts
that can be optimized. what's your hemoglobin a1c? what's your bmi? do you smoke, or not? here's your depression screening index, and start to optimize
metrics and measurements, so that what used to be a right
brain, left brain collusion [8003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8003.089s)

of seeing, intuiting a
whole through personal, so i'm with you, daniel. i get a sense of who you are. i can intuit things that i
could not even write in a note, but it wouldn't matter, because
what i write in the note is really to jog my memory. it's not for anybody else. it's not for billing, or
anything, in the old days, right? but now, i don't get to do that. i don't get to see you holistically. [8028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8028.158s)

i don't get to see you in
your built environment. i don't get to see you at home. i don't get to see you
as part of your whole. i see you as part, and not only a part, but all the metrics and
incentives that pay me and that govern me is that
bureaucratic, left brain stuff that reduces everything to these series that i then have to click off, which means i spend more
time looking at the computer, clicking off the boxes than
i do actually in a we space [8047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8047.493s)

with you having an
intersubjective dialogue, where you're not just a it, you're an i, and you're also a we. none of that is incentivized. so what you're pointing at as
civilization-level threat is already in fruition in healthcare, and it is a [[self-terminating]]
process in healthcare, because we can't keep
spending 30% of our gdp on something that gets
us the worst outcomes in the developed world, right? [8075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8075.927s)

so when i talk about the next
transcendent healthcare 3.0, it is that integral,
post-cynical, holistic, dialogued, authentic diversity,
everything that you just said is applicable in that space. that's why when you talk,
i just sit here going, "how do we actually make
this happen in healthcare?" - daniel okay, so if you wanna think about what
is the future of healthcare, you can't think about it separate than the future of civilization, [8103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8103.154s)

giving that all the other aspects of civilization are
affecting human health. - zubin i think that's a
theme of the entire thing, yeah. - daniel and so, can you
do a good job of healthcare without addressing agricultural practices that demineralize soil? - zubin mmm, no. - daniel no.
- zubin how can you? - daniel and so, if you have ubiquitously demineralized soil, [8123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8123.292s)

and you use npk to get something that looks like a vegetable, but doesn't have the same
trace mineral density, and those trace minerals are important for the gazillion things, are you gonna have a bunch
of subclinical deficiencies that cause, you know, problems? and similarly, now you're
gonna cover it in glyphosate, and so, now you'll have deficiency and toxicity simultaneously, right? [8141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8141.133s)

and can you have something like hostess and coca-cola's multi-billion dollar, multinational advertising conglomerate, you know, capacities
that are optimized for, you know, addiction optimization? like can you have that thing, and have a maximally healthy
population at the same time? - zubin which also then
generates an epiphenomenon of a big pharmaceutical
company that is designed to then patch up the holes created [8167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8167.103s)

by the addictive economy of our food and ecological mess. - daniel yeah, 'cause i
can just take the statin, and i can just take the insulin, and not have to actually
deal with the dietary thing. it's similarly a short-term, parts-based, you know, et cetera.
- zubin yup. - daniel and you know, i think, the thing i think medicine
has done a particularly, like modern medicine has done
a particularly exceptional job [8187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8187.964s)

at is things that have single-point cause, and where you can identify-
- zubin absolutely, when there's one gene, or
one protein, or one problem. - daniel so acute medicine
is always like that, right? an acute poisoning, an acute infection, an acute injury is fuckin' awesome. - zubin yeah, you're
stabbed in the neck? i can fix that. - daniel and, but the
things that don't have a single cause, that have
multiple causes particularly, [8208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8208.14s)

so complex causation, causal cascades that are delayed in time, and where they're not the
same in everybody, right? it's not even, it's these
three things that cause it, but it's some subset of
these thousands of things that end up causing. so the way i think about
complex chronic disease, whether we're talking
about neurodegenerative, or autoimmune, i don't think
there is such a thing as ms, or rheumatoid arthritis as a single thing, [8232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8232.5s)

meaning that the same causal
cascade happened for everybody, right, which is why
sometimes that gene is there, and sometimes it isn't, and sometimes. i think of that more
as a set of biomarkers and a set of symptoms
that cluster together usefully for a diagnostic
code for insurance purposes, for regulatory purposes,
for pharmaceutical purposes, but where the pathophysiology
leading there was different, and which is why we don't
do a good job at curing them is 'cause we don't do a good
job at assessing the causation [8258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8258.607s)

'cause it's not single cause, right? it's a complex thing to figure out, which is why i think the
best stuff that's happening in functional medicine
is doing a better job. when you look at like the
work bredesen is doing with alzheimer's and dementia, and i think perlmutter and others have kind of weighed in on some of that work, it's a personalized medicine approach to how to deal with it, 'cause it's not [8281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8281.99s)

the exact same
pathophysiology in each case, but getting really interesting results. so for instance, and i'm just playing
this out hypothetically, somebody has ms, and you do a really
detailed history intake, and you know, they had a head injury that maybe created subclinical tbi, meaning didn't show up
with morphological damage, but it would show up on a spect scan, [8307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8307.29s)

or on a functional kind of eeg, and then they had mold
toxins in their house, and then they had a
really stressful divorce, and they've had chronic
sugar kind of issues, and you get each one of those
causing dysregulatory dynamics that eventually can cluster that way, but in a slightly different thing. might be rheumatoid,
autoimmune, or something else. but for someone else, it
was like lyme disease, and a certain amount of
petrol toxin exposure, [8331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8331.257s)

and some other set of things, and with more genetic precursor. so the way... so how to even think about
the physiologic causal aspects of it has to involve a
more complex epistemology. - zubin yeah. and we don't train medical
students to do that. we train them in the reductionist
model as much as possible, turn things into parts. so that has to change. [8357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8357.866s)

and that's part, it's gotta co-evolve with civilization change. it's gotta co-evolve with
societal and environmental change. it's gotta co-evolve with economic change, and social change, and
all the other things. and yet, what i find often
is society in its ills, the failures of civilization
actually often end up on the doorstep of the healthcare system, and then what it does
is it ripples through the actual healthcare worker population. [8381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8381.365s)

so you know, we use terms like burnout. it's really a kind of
chronic moral injury, 'cause these are good people
who went in for good reasons, and they find themselves
unable to help people, because they're in a model
that doesn't allow it, and the holistic way of
looking at it is just, it's not rewarded. it's not paid for. you're paid to turn things
into parts, to bill by code. - daniel well, and i mean, you know, [8402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8402.057s)

you've mentioned that the
relationship to patent law, and regulatory process, and fiscal incentive all co-influence. in a way it's like it's not some bad guy. it's just the nature of
the system does that thing. - zubin yeah. - daniel if you wanna go through, if you have to go through
phase iii clinical trials to be able to get the thing approved, and that costs like a
billion dollars to do, [8421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8421.783s)

especially when you amortize that some of them won't make it, so for a drug company
to get one that works, you have some of number that don't work, you have to be a big
fuckin' company to be able to do that thing. and you can't just, insurance doesn't support
general health increase. it has to be disease,
so you diagnose diseases in particular ways for
kind of insurance purposes. [8440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8440.113s)

and so, that whole
cluster of things means, and you're not gonna be able
to patent endogenous molecules, and increasing the things
that were there in youth anywhere near as easily, so
it's synthetic molecules. what's the chance that a deficiency in the synthetic molecule
was the causal reason that you got ill, that was not a part of your
evolutionary environment, or healthy people? - zubin you don't have
a sertraline deficiency? [8461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8461.78s)

(daniel laughs)
a zoloft deficiency? - daniel it doesn't
even make sense, right? like you would think okay, well, when the same person with
the same genome was healthy, what was happening
differently was a difference in endogenous molecules, right? so can we study the molecules of health, and how they proliferate? but that does require
changes in the regulatory- - zubin yeah.
- daniel epistemic, [8480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8480.079s)

fiscal, et cetera process. and obviously, if the people
are all getting fed sugar, and stress, and isolation to begin with, they're fucked in the first place, right? - zubin yeah.
- daniel and so, when i think about the future of medicine, i think about a system that
is mostly preventing illness, but it's not preventing illness. it's promoting health across
all of the dimensions. and of course, you can't define health. [8499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8499.207s)

you can kind of roughly define
it, but it's that same thing, increased adaptive capacity
to an increased number of stressors of any kind. you can kind of roughly define it, right? but if you are promoting that, then there's very little hospital, right? it's mostly decentralized, in the same way we want education to be mostly decentralized. you want a civilization that's
developing humans writ large, [8517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8517.168s)

and not just at the school. you want a civilization that's promoting the health of people writ
large, not just at the hospital. and then, when people
do come to the hospital, i would like it to be
much more like a temple. - zubin mmm, i agree. i've said this, the future
of medicine is more shamanic than, you know, than procedural. - daniel i mean, people
are gonna die there, and people are gonna be born there, [8538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8538.017s)

and people are gonna have
near-death experience, and come back. if anything should be a temple, it should be a fuckin' hospital. - zubin can i tell you
as somebody who's spent most of my life (laughs) it
feels like in a hospital, i mean, i'm a hospitalist,
that's my specialty, the place is anything but
a temple in many ways, and it's only made a temple
by people's conscious efforts where you take a second to
realize you're in a sacred space [8556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8556.859s)

with a patient who's dying, or with a family who's having the worst, you know, week of their
lives, or something like that. the then any space becomes sacred, but it requires the intentionality
of the person there, and if that person is so beaten down, is so obsessed with the
parts just to survive, then that gets taken
away, and they feel that, and they manifest it biopsychosocially
in their own disease. - daniel oh, this is why i
was mentioning the complexity [8580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8580.196s)

of even looking at the physiology, right? so of course, looking at
the physiology complexly, like have i, am i looking at
the subclinical deficiencies, and subclinical toxicities,
and subclinical pathogenicity, am i looking at the
physiological structure, and their dentistry, and you know, subclinical brain patterns
in their spect scan, and whatever, all the things, some things that were
uncurable become curable when you really start to, or treatable, [8603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8603.212s)

when you really start to go in deeper. but obviously i also have to be looking at their relationships, have
to be looking at their psyche, i have to look at the environment, because does their house have mold in it? i'm not gonna necessarily get them better if i don't deal with
certain of those things. how long does it take
to do that intake well? (zubin laughs) like the doctors who i know
who do a good job of this- [8620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8620.147s)

- zubin yeah, it's hours. - daniel you have a five-hour intake. - zubin yeah.
- daniel and then to be able to track what is working, and what isn't, and whatever when you can't
do perfect variable isolation, and you really have to sense it, so how does the economics of that system that requires doctors that are way the fuck more trained-
- zubin yeah. - daniel than we currently have, [8636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8636.501s)

and yet, with that much time investment? well, obviously, you mostly just want to use the doctors a lot less, 'cause you have a system
that is promoting health, and then if they're also more trained, kind of to be able to do the
psychospiritual interface that is happening there, it's just a totally different vision. - zubin it's a totally different thing, and the friends that i have
who do this sort of medicine, [8652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8652.913s)

they're more in the concierge space. so you know, people pay a lot
of money for unlimited access and they'll do those five-hour things. they'll look at every aspect. no stone will be unturned. they'll come to the
house, that kind of thing, and it's unfortunately
the realm of the affluent. - daniel totally. - zubin so how do, you
know, i think it's doable. in fact, i've talked about it, [8671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8671.98s)

this idea that you can actually do it, and it requires a team. it's not just a doctor. that's the other thing. you can't, you need an in
interdisciplinary group, where everybody's practicing the best that they're trained to do, and they're feeding back
to each other in a huddle, and we did that at our
clinic in last vegas. i mean, it was this,
you had health coaches, [8687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8687.934s)

who are drawn from that community, who know that population,
who speak that language, who know the hopes, dreams, and fears, and could get in people's heads,
and then you have doctors, nurses, nurse practitioner, a licensed clinical social
worker who does the mental health and care coordination and
all those other things, and we would call them nurse innovators. why do we reduce nurses to pill pushers and data entry clerks when they
are so much more than that? [8708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8708.769s)

they were self-selected
for being nurturing types. like what are we doing? so all of that is solvable, but you need new, you need
all the things you said, the changes in incentive
structures, in [[social structure|social structures]], in governance, in
regulatory stuff, all that. - daniel yeah, so i want the
number of nurses per capita to go way up.
- zubin that would be nice. - daniel i want the number
of doctors per capita to go up. i want the number of teachers
per capita to go way up, [8731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8731.552s)

so that the students have much
more personalized attention, and i want the amount we
can train them to go up, so you can really fuckin'
train those people, and really maximally talented ones, 'cause how are you gonna get a maximally talented future generation if the teachers are not the
maximally talented people? - zubin right.
- daniel and so, how do you make an economic
system that does that? - zubin yeah, how do you do that? [8749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8749.163s)

- daniel well, in the face of the increasing technological
automation of so many jobs, and yet the increasing wealth that is produced by those things, can you start to create new
types of economic systems, and economic rewards to have
a higher percentage of people doing these types of
very, very high-touch, high-complexity things, and
getting more rewarded to do so? - zubin yeah, intuitive,
creative, holistic things that require a human intelligence. [8771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8771.571s)

that's enabled by tech, right? so the tech actually can
help offload, you know, i don't know if it was
kasparov who said it, but he said, you know,
that big blue, or whatever, it could beat any human alive, but you give me big blue as a tool, and i'll beat any human,
or any computer alive. - daniel right.
- zubin yeah, and i think that's true in medicine, too. we talk about ai replacing
doctors, i don't think that's- [8790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8790.007s)

- daniel symbiotic intelligence between [[collective intelligence|collective intelligences]]
of humans designed well with the augmented computational capacity. - zubin yeah, so the
mechanical intelligence that computers are very good at- - daniel this is the
same as what the future of democratic type systems could be is you make something better
than the [[fourth estate]], which is something that is facebook-like, meaning it can curate all the information. [8810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8810.595s)

it can do machine learning
kind of parsing on it, and customize newsfeeds, but where it is optimizing for things like the relevant,
comprehensive educatedness of a population for things. - zubin social cohesion, whatever. - daniel and, but you know, the same types of generative ai, semantic generative ai,
like gpt-3 that can make an infinite amount of
super compelling deep fakes [8834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8834.841s)

and fuck the [[epistemic commons]] more, can also parse, could
be developed to parse massive fields of text to
see what is the distribution of the values that everyone
has about a particular thing to take as design constraints, or try to come up with
a better proposition that would be less polarizing, and more unifying for
the whole population. - zubin the opposite of
what algorithms do now. - daniel and it's not that
it's replacing human choice. [8856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8856.911s)

it's informing- - zubin informing human choice, exactly- - daniel one way that you
get over the data singularity of that there's more data than
anyone can pay attention to is people don't actually need to make, they don't need all the
data to make a choice. they need the meaning, which is like a second, or
third derivative on the data, which can i have the ai
process a fuckton of data to be able to parse where
there's incorrect stuff, [8875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8875.323s)

where there's high confidence stuff, and put it into the form
that is decision informing, and then what is relevant
for decision informing is stuff that people can
actually keep up with? - zubin and that is
actually the application of big data in medicine, too. we don't need, the data is too much. there's tons of data. you could have wearables. you could have all this other garbage. [8892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8892.195s)

doctors are terrified of that, because what the hell are
we gonna do with that data? what we need is to parse it down into bits that then we can find meaning,
and use our intuition, which is, that's why we do
10,000 hours of training, right, is because that becomes an
unconscious intuitive thing. and only humans right now
have the inductive ability really to do that, and i actually had federico
faggin on the show. he's the guy who co-developed [8918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8918.547s)

the world's first commercial
microprocessor with intel, and he wrote a book on
like, look, consciousness, machines will never have
internal state awareness because of the following
types of limitations in their intelligence, and he
makes these very, you know, absolute statements, which
you could argue with, but it was really, you know, this idea that humans do
a type of intelligence that's almost rooted in the infinite. it's almost rooted in
the tao, in the sublime, [8943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8943.567s)

in emptiness, whatever
spiritual term you wanna call. it's bringing forth this thing
that the computers can't do, but that doesn't mean we
can't use them as a tool. but we've devalued that
aspect of humanity now, especially in medicine. - daniel when you look at
alphago's relationship to people with chess, and then with go,
and then with video games, and you continue to
forecast where that goes, can ai, in any way that you model
how it's gonna unfold, [8973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=8973.272s)

beat humans at all definable games? totally. and that means military games,
that means economic games. can someone who can't do ai
high-speed trading compete with someone who can? no, right? and this is where
(daniel laughs) the finitely definable [[game theory]] is not the only thing worth doing, right? and that thing, of
course, we do lose to ais, [9001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9001.906s)

and so, then it's a race of
who can deploy the ais better, or faster, but that is a race that the endpoints of are not nice. - zubin mmm-hmm. - daniel and so, but this
is a fundamental question. we're talking about the
redesign of medicine. you think every sector
has to be redesigned. we're talking about the
redesign of the [[fourth estate]], and of democratic process,
the redesign of education. what is the purpose of education [9029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9029.677s)

in a post-technological automation, post-ubiquitous ai world,
where most of the things that we were teaching kids to
do have all been automated? - zubin like math, et cetera- - daniel well, obviously,
to be able to answer what is the future of education is what is the role of the
human in that world? and then, 'cause education
is to develop humans that have the capacities to do that thing. and i think it happens
to be that the thing [9053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9053.775s)

that humans do uniquely well relative to at least the narrow
ais that we currently have are also things that humans have more intrinsic incentive to do. the things that are easier
to automate are more rote, usually, you have less
intrinsic incentive on. and so, you have to
extrinsically incent people, so you get market dynamics
of all these types. as you're able to still create wealth, automate a lot of those things, [9076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9076.735s)

are the remaining things things that have more intrinsic incentive? plus, you have more total
resource to allocate. there's some interesting things
in there that are possible. - zubin interesting and optimistic. interesting and optimistic. i think, you know, that
there's a future is very bright kind of vision there that, where humans are freed to actually be the kind of selves they
actually want to be, [9095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9095.941s)

you know, their own authentic self. you know, i gotta say, man, we've had a 2 1/2-hour conversation, and i'm looking at my card here, and i'm worried it's
gonna give up the ghost as we reach the end of the
capacity of that second card. man, i could talk to you for like 17 hours on any one of these things, and i still had other stuff that we probably won't be
able to reach this time, but- [9115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9115.223s)

- daniel let's do another time. - zubin would you do that?
- daniel yeah, totally. - zubin 'cause you were kind enough to swing outta your way today, and-
- daniel this was a blast. i love the type of public
education you're doing. i think it's so, so important. and so, i was really happy to come. super enjoyed this conversation, and yeah, there's a bunch
of other places we could go. [9131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9131.024s)

i'm curious to hear what is interesting, what people have questions on, disagree with from this piece. and... and i... yeah, i love the fact that
you're publicly educating and learning publicly
simultaneously, right, and a medical expert who
is actually learning, updating their position,
and trying to orient people towards synthesis of something [9161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9161.09s)

that is otherwise culture-breaking. and (laughs) i really
wanna see you do that thing where you get the experts in the, because it needs to happen. - zubin you're very kind,
we're gonna try to do that. i have to say this, daniel,
you are one of the people that i can consistently look at online in your resources to try to learn from, and you've been instrumental
in my own understanding of these sort of
civilization-level threats, [9187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9187.74s)

and how to even apply them down
to my own field of medicine, but even beyond that. so i'm looking forward to
continuing the dialogue. i'd love to get, you
know, tristan and zak- - daniel yeah.
- zubin on the show, and talk to them about these
things, too, because again- - daniel i'll send you intros. - zubin oh, that'd be awesome, and where can we find you online? - daniel there's a project that [9207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9207.407s)

we started a little while ago. it's still in beta phase, and we have some super interesting things we'll be doing with it in this next year. it's called the consilience
project, consilienceproject.org, and i have a personal blog that mostly just has a list of podcasts up at civilizationemerging.com. - zubin okay, great, i'll
put both those links in, and yeah, those interviews
are fantastic, man. [9226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9226.269s)

i think you did like a four-hour
thing with lex fridman. man, i tell you, next time, we're gonna do six hours just to beat lex- - daniel he spent the
first half hour on ufos, which i didn't expect
we were gonna go there, but yeah, lex is cool. - zubin i heard that,
i remember thinking, "you actually know more
about ufos than you should." like where did you even learn about that? - daniel well, i mean, just think about [9248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9248.103s)

what a consequential topic it is depending upon what is true.
- zubin the most. - daniel so i think anything
that is hard epistemically to figure out if it's true or
not, but super consequential, and differentially consequential one way, or the other is just
innately really interesting. - zubin yeah, there you go. well, see, that's what i love
about you is your (laughs), your curiosity drives you
to go from first principles to establish really interesting
thought patterns on stuff, [9269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9269.734s)

and you're really a unique guy. thank you. guys, you know what to do. share the show. if you really like what we do, i was talking about locals earlier. i'm gonna pitch it one more
time, zdoggmd.locals.com, and you can join us there for free, or become a supporter for
like five bucks a month, and then we have this little
internal tribal dialogue [9286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9286.155s)

that's looking for consilience, synthesis, alt-middle, integral, all the things, post-cynical thought, so thank you. - daniel i haven't been there yet. i've heard about it, i'll
come find you on locals. - zubin find me and-
- daniel be a supporter. - zubin and then poke
holes in all the problems with locals, 'cause i know you'll find 'em.
(zubin laughs) - daniel cool, thank you, zubin- [9302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7aIgHoydP8&t=9302.732s)

- zubin all right, brother, take care.
