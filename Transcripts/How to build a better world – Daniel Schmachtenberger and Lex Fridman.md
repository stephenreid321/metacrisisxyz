but another way to say that is wisdom is uh constantly expanding and evolving set of metrics but so which means there is something in you that is recognizing a new metric that's important that isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection discernment yeah awareness and this is this [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=22.64s)

iterative [[game theory]] there's the girdles and completeness theorem right which is if the system if the set of things is consistent it won't be complete so we're going to keep adding to it which is why we're saying earlier i don't think it's not beautiful and especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=39.04s)

for at the individual level is becoming right they were becoming more well that's then becomes true for the civilization and our metric sets as well and our definition of how to think about a meaningful life in a meaningful civilization i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are what's that uh well love is obviously not a metric [58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=58.16s)

it's like you can bench yeah it's a good metric yeah i want to optimize that across the entire population starting with infants um so in the same way that love isn't a metric but you could make metrics that look at certain parts of it this thing i'm about to say isn't a metric but it's a it's a consideration because i thought about this a lot i i don't think there is a metric a right one um i think that every metric by itself without this thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a [[paperclip maximizer]] i think that's why what the idea of false idol means in terms of the model of reality [93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=93.68s)

not being reality then my sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever to the known but also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know but to learn new stuff and to be open to perceive reality [113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=113.52s)

directly so my model never becomes sacred my model is useful the model can't be the false idle correct yeah and this is why the first verse of the tao te ching is the dao that is nameable is not the eternal dao the naming then can become the source of the ten thousand things that if you get too carried away with it can actually [131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=131.36s)

obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the models it sounds a lot a lot like steven wolfram but in a different language much more poetic i can imagine that no i'm referring i'm joking but there's echoes of cellular automata which you can't name you can't construct a good model [148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=148.959s)

cellular automata you can only watch in awe i apologize i'm distracting your train of thought horribly and miserably making it by the way something robots aren't good at in uh dealing with the uncertainty of uneven ground you've been okay so far you've been doing wonderfully so what's your [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=167.04s)

favorite metrics okay so i know you're not wrong so i have a fascinatory test so one metric and there are problems with this but one metric that i like to just as a [[thought experiment]] to consider is because you're actually asking work i mean i know you ask your guests about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're design when [187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=187.36s)

you're saying what is a desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to that right um and then you have whatever your answer is how do you know what is the what is the epistemic basis for for [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=207.92s)

postulating that um there's also a whole other reason for asking that question i don't i mean but that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever which is it's interesting how few people have been asked questions like it we we we joke about these questions is silly right it's it's funny to watch a person and if i was more of an i would really stick on that question right it's a silly question in some sense but like we haven't really considered what it means just a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a better world what is the kind of world we're trying to create think well have you really thought i'll [253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=253.519s)

give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me but let me do the societal indices first because they're fun yes we should take a note of this meaningful thing because it's important to come back to um are you reminding me to ask you about the meaning of life noted [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=270.32s)

let me jot that down yeah so um well because i think i stopped tracking it like 25 open threads um okay let it all burn one index that i find very interesting is the inverse correlation of addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction within the people in it the less healthy i think the [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=296.4s)

society is as a pretty fundamental metric and so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values uh and in so far as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it [317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=317.68s)

the inverse of addiction uh yeah compulsive behavior that is destructive towards things that we value yeah i think that's a very interesting one that's a really interesting one yeah and this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed [346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=346.24s)

to [[hypernormal stimuli]] and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and needing that [[hypernormal stimuli]] which does involve a kind of hormesis so i do think the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um virtualized discomfort yeah i think [371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=371.12s)

that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and the ayahuasca journey and the sundance were i think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was is to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome some things to make beings that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some [392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=392.4s)

fears but we don't want to put everybody in war or real trauma and yet we can see that the most up people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma but some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods have a lot of trauma whether or not they happen to make it through and overcome that or not [409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=409.36s)

so how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people a certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the other people are there so it's both [433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=433.199s)

a resilience of the individuals and the resilience of the bonding so i think we'll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also develop resilience in the presence of that for the anti-addiction direction and the fullness of character and the trustworthiness to others so you [450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=450.8s)

have to be uh consistently injecting discomfort into the system ritualize i mean this sounds like uh you have to imagine sisyphus happy you have to uh imagine sisyphus with his rock optimally resilient from a metrics perspective in society so we we want [472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=472.8s)

we want to constantly be throwing rocks at ourselves not constantly uh you didn't have to frequently um periodically periodically and there's different levels of intensity different periodicities now i do not think this should be imposed by states i think it should emerge from cultures and i think the cultures are developing [496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=496.479s)

people that understand the value of it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but there's also a voluntarism because the people value the thing that is being developed they understand it and that's what conditions with conditioning it's conditioning some of these some of these values and [514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=514.719s)

conditioning is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize the language that we speak and the words that we think and in the in the patterns of thought built into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just based on where we're born you can't not condition [530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=530.72s)

people so all you can do is take more responsibility for what the conditioning factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is a meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and then we're becoming [546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=546.56s)

affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments digital environments physical environments social environments would we want to create that would develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even those sets of things that matter so you end up getting [565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=565.519s)

deep existential consideration at the heart of civilization design when you start to realize how powerful we're becoming and how much what we're building it in service towards matters before i pull it i think three threads you just laid down uh is there another metric index that you're interested in i'll tell you one [582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=582.88s)

more that i really like there's a there's a number but one then the next one that comes to mind is i have to make a very quick model uh healthy human bonding say we were in a travel type setting my positive emotional states in your positive emotional states would most the time be correlated your negative emotional states in mine [610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=610.56s)

and so you start laughing i start laughing you start crying my eyes might tear up and we would call that the compassion compersion axis i would this is a model i find useful so compassion is when you're feeling something negative i feel some pain i feel some empathy something [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=629.2s)

in relationship compersion is when you do well i'm stoked for you right like i actually feel happiness i like conversion yeah the fact that it's such a uncommon word in english is actually a problem culturally um because i feel that often and i think that's a really good feeling to feel and maximize for actually that's [647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=647.44s)

actually the metric i'm going to say oh wow is the compassion compersion access is the thing i would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional states in your emotional states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy i don't want to hurt you but i don't care if i do or for you to do well or [666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=666.8s)

whatever but there's a worse state and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions correspond to your negative ones and vice versa and that is the i i would call it the jealousy sadism axis the jealousy axis is when you're doing really well i feel something bad i feel taken away from less than upset [688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=688.399s)

envious whatever and that's so common but i think of it as kind of a low-grade psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that i'm actually upset at the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly  up thing no we shouldn't shame it and repress it [711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=711.04s)

so it gets worse we should study it where does it come from and it comes from our own insecurities and stuff and but then the next part that everybody knows is really up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is so the jealousy or the envy is the i feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is i [728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=728.72s)

actually feel good when you lose or when you're in pain i feel some happiness that's associated you can see when someone feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that partner to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path [747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=747.839s)

to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion access so i would like to see a society that is inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the the lower that amount and the more the compassion conversion and if i had to summarize that very simply i'd say it would optimize for conversion [766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=766.16s)

which is because notice that's not just saying love for you where i might be self-sacrificing and miserable and i love people but i kill myself which i don't think anybody thinks is a great idea or happiness where i might be sociopathically happy where i'm causing problems all over the place or even sadistically happy [784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=784.639s)

but it's a coupling right that i'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship where i my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too that's actually speaking of another pickup line uh that's quite honestly what i this is a guy who's single this is [804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=804.0s)

this is gonna come out very ridiculous because it's like oh yeah where's your girlfriend bro but that's what i look for in a relationship because it's like it's so much it's so it's such an amazing life where you actually get joy from another person's success and they get joy from your success [825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=825.76s)

and then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a like a a a like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially it's weird so like just be just enjoying the the happiness of others the success of others so this this is like the uh let's call this because the first person that [848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=848.48s)

drilled this into my head is rogan joe rogan he was the embodiment of that because i saw somebody who's uh successful rich and non-stop truly i mean you could tell when somebody's full of somebody's not really genuinely enjoying the success of his friends that that was weird to me that was interesting and i mean the way you're [871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=871.04s)

kind of speaking to it the reason joe stood out to me is i guess i haven't witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture of just real joy for others i mean part of that has to do there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or listen to people being their authentic cells so i'm sure there's a [893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=893.04s)

bunch of people who live life with compersion they probably don't seek public attention also but the that that was yeah if if there was any word that could express what what i've learned from john white he's been a a really inspiring figure is that compersion and i wish our world was uh had a lot more of that because then it i mean my own [916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=916.24s)

sorry to go to small tangent but like you're speaking how society should function but i feel like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life you're going to live a truly fulfilling life i don't know what the right word to use but that's a really good way to live life you will also [939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=939.12s)

learn what gets in the way of it and how to work with it that if you wanted to help try to build systems at scale or apply facebook or exponential technologies to do that you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes and this is you know as you mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you get stoked on other [959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=959.519s)

people doing well and then they have a similar relationship to you and everyone is in the process of building each other up and this is what i would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy version the healthy version right the the root i believe it's a latin word that means to strive together [977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=977.68s)

and it's that impulse of becoming where i want to become more but i recognize that there's actually a hormesis there's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that but that means that yes there's an impulse where i'm trying to get ahead maybe i'm even trying to win but i actually want a good opponent and i want them to get ahead too because [995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=995.44s)

that is where my ongoing becoming happens and the win itself will get boring very quickly the ongoing becoming is where there's aliveness and for the ongoing becoming they need to have it too and that's the stride together the so in the healthy competition i'm stoked when they're doing really well because my becoming is supported by it [1012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oflv3u0HEA&t=1012.0s)

you
