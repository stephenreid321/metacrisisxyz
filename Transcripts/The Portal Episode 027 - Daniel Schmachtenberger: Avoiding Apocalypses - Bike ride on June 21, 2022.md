music hello this is eric with a few thoughts for our housekeeping section this week as this is our second episode to be released during a bizarre and near global patchwork of local quarantines i wanted to update you on my evolving thinking and understanding surrounding our shared pandemic but perhaps more importantly i want to begin putting this response to the virus in the context of [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=23.039s)

what we've already talked about in the portal in particular the disk or distributed idea suppression complex introduced in episode 18 appears to be in full swing so how do we know that this is happening well twitter and this is just as an example has now refined their terms of service to broaden their definition of harm itself to address in their words [43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=43.12s)

and i quote content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information rather than reports we will enforce this in close coordination with trusted partners including public health authorities and governments and continue to use and consult with information from [60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=60.48s)

those sources when reviewing content under this new guidance we will require people to remove tweets now of course in a pandemic that sounds sensible at least to my ears in such a situation who wants marginal gadflies like i don't know mike cernovich or the infamous mencius molebug aka curtis yarvin contradicting the mayor of new york city bill de blasio or the [81](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=81.92s)

washington post in a time crying out for coordinated and authoritative response well here's the awkward part many of the people who called this epidemic early and correctly were the very marginal internet personalities that the legacy media folks love to deride as trolls grifters and gadflies as for the mayor of new york city well after cernovich and moldbug had [104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=104.88s)

correctly called for drastic action bill de blasio wrote i'm encouraging new yorkers to go on with your lives and get out on the town despite coronavirus and that was in early march a sentiment that was echoed by the washington post that viewed concern over the virus as a kind of neurosis that had to be addressed psychologically in short the gated institutional [125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=125.52s)

narrative or jinn was not close to being the first to see covet as the giant threat requiring a planetary response it was those outside the gin that not only saw this early but proved that it was seeable early by many different individuals who generally seem to sit outside the institutional and respectable worlds so just why was this well first of all [147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=147.44s)

the portal has argued many times before that we have had an almost universally unworkable leadership class now in place for just under 50 years and that it arose to disguise the end of the post-war economic growth regime this is a collection of people who have refactored the institutions that they've led within our system specifically to evade the [[embedded growth obligation|embedded growth obligations]] or egos that were set in the previous era and who rewarded each other generally for doing exactly the wrong things in terms of the public good with an end to mandatory retirements the same people have been promoted for borrowing against the future and playing games of russian roulette with financial markets and health care while self-dealing within the system that they [188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=188.08s)

were handed stewards for the generations to come serving a false god of fake economic efficiency that reliably and deliberately fails to adequately incorporate actual economics like negative externalities von neumann morgenstern sub-utility functions principal agent problems moral hazard etc etc our ubiquitous economists have [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=206.159s)

hidden behind the mask of technocrats working for the public good while merely pretending to practice their own profession health care mandarins too regularly ignore the warnings coming out of their own literature i mean heading over to google scholar which readiness czar or hospital head could forget titles like mechanical ventilation in an airborne [225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=225.2s)

epidemic by fua in 2008 or preparing intensive care for the next pandemic influenza by taylor kane and robert fowler in 2019 were those back-to-back hits of meltzer at all stockpiling ventilators for influenza pandemics and estimates of the demand for mechanical ventilation in the united states during an influenza pandemic in 2017 and 2015 respectively [244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=244.799s)

in short we got here not because we couldn't foresee this future in fact we extensively studied it we got here because we decided to ignore the future that we knew was coming the specific class of people that we had at the helm of our institutions were constitutionally incapable of putting their foot down and asserting that we needed deeper reserves in order to [265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=265.84s)

handle what they called surge capacity so do i know what's going on what i said during this section of our last episode still holds true this week my continuing discussions with a number of people i respect deeply seem surprisingly inconclusive to me even at this late date so my mind wanders to the second order question of why it would be so difficult to sketch a straightforward [285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=285.919s)

narrative to guide us in fact dr peter atia's most recent video evidences some of this confusion where he shares that as a physician he feels so spun around by what he is hearing that even he is forced to think in political rather than medical or scientific terms to explain the situation to oversimplify slightly there are three [303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=303.919s)

great risks with the covet virus one of under-reaction one of over-reaction and one of inappropriate reaction the first threatens an enormous body count from the virus with severe respiratory and other damage to many of the recovered the second threatens a worldwide depression which could well lead to armed clashes and even wars of various [321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=321.039s)

sizes the last leads to many of our efforts being wasted or even captured by profiteers at a time when we are demanded not to deeply question the coordinating authorities and oddly we are being prepared to participate in both under and overreactions simultaneously just as many of us are worrying about allocations of financial assistance that [340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=340.24s)

are now valued in the trillions i mean this is crazy at some level no we are somehow discussing ill-conceived multi-trillion dollar assistance packages at the same time as we are being ready to go back to work while also hearing that new york is now apocalyptic i mean that's pretty confusing we're going to transfer vast amounts of wealth [358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=358.96s)

so please know that everything will be fine when you get back to work shortly but in the meantime the borough of queens is experiencing armageddon even by high school dating standards that's a lot of mixed and conflicting messages now what could explain this odd state of affairs i found myself compelled by a very simple idea from whose grip i cannot [377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=377.44s)

easily escape the idea is straightforward what if our leadership is treating this as much as an accountability crisis as a medical one when it comes to their actions i mean what if the issue over which we are being quarantined isn't actually the number of deaths they are trying to prevent but the type of deaths perhaps there is one special category of [395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=395.84s)

death then that our leaders are more afraid of than all others for reasons of accountability rather than the simple loss of life in order to explore this idea it might help to make it somewhat concrete therefore imagine that you had drafted a blank tweet on twitter called new york blue check death list for at least minorly well-known accounts that you [413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=413.52s)

follow from new york state that are eventually brought low by the covid virus and that it initially has no other content of course it would start out blank but now imagine that every time one of these account owners dies of covid you plan to add them to your soon to be growing list that's pretty morbid but hey it's now a pandemic after all [432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=432.88s)

oddly these aren't even really the deaths that i'm talking about quite yet perhaps the first few are old people who have lived long and full lives but as your list begins to fill up there may come a first gruesome death that happened to a vital younger person who desperately needed a ventilator or an icu bed or a trained md or nurse to have a fighting chance [452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=452.88s)

let us call these triage deaths if they result from a missing resource that could have and should have been stocked for just such emergencies these losses are beginning to outline the class of death that i believe may now be driving this difficult to understand response from our political and medical leadership while deaths from the virus may be [470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=470.319s)

tragic these specific triage deaths may be considered career-ending deaths of accountability for medical scientific business and political leaders who specifically failed to heed warnings from the group studying our preparedness as such they may have mattered most in determining the shape of our current response as they are all deaths that come from failing to implement copious [490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=490.96s)

previous work in identifying our vulnerabilities meant to shape our disaster preparedness these would be quite bad because they would involve people that we feel we know but it could actually get much worse for our leaders than that if you were now to swap out the blue check requirement and exchange it instead for i don't know the [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=508.4s)

most sympathetic person you could imagine what happens when death swoops down on a young girl of eight named aruna who needs a ventilator desperately but can't get one or perhaps the entire gomez family is turned away from a queen's er or made to wait for icu beds that never materialize while there is still time to save three out of their four members i [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=526.959s)

mean what if it is these triage deaths which are actually closer to negligent homicide than mere viral losses that are actually terrifying our leaders into draconian action rather than the total number of dead as they say this hypothesis has the advantage of at least being consistent with the otherwise confusing and seemingly conflicting themes developed before [546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=546.959s)

burdens from our leaders who were caught having utterly failed in their mission to keep us prepared would have to be shifted onto our entire society as a whole think about it the public would be asked for broad participation in something like flatten the curve and why to cover for the lack of the same icu beds masks ppe and ventilators that were [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=566.32s)

called for in numerous academic papers over the last 20 years studying just such viral pandemic scenarios i mean it's really quite close as the authorities now scramble at top speed to finally get the missing resources in place that should have been banked all along they would also simultaneously be preparing us to go back to work to risk [585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=585.76s)

regular viral rather than triage deaths just as soon as the shortfalls could be made up as there doesn't seem to be a highly credible plan to defeat the virus to see the implications of this triage death avoidance hypothesis conduct a [[thought experiment]] imagine that all of the rate limiting resources for efficient icu treatment were suddenly parachuted out on pallets [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=607.6s)

from helicopters all over the world the question is would we continue to shelter in place given that we have no cure or vaccine or would we be told to toughen up and go back to work now i don't know the answer but i believe the question is not devoid of interest think about it i will as well music this episode introduces a relatively [633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=633.36s)

unknown guest to our portal audience now many of you are familiar with the concept of true fame versus other kinds of fame for example there's big in europe or internet famous well in a certain west coast subculture there is a concept of california famous and such names would include laura demming michael vasser eliezer utkowski alex green currently in federal prison jordan [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=656.0s)

greenhall julia gailiff tristan harris daniel barkay tom chi grant sanderson rick doblin brett victor and many others my guest on this episode is my friend daniel schmochtenberger an important node in the system now the odd thing about daniel is that wherever he or i found ourselves riffing with others on topics existential someone would often tell us about the [677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=677.76s)

other and that we needed to become friends as well and i think that was probably a pretty good call on their part i have sat on this episode for months however because i was hoping that i would have a second chance to record with daniel given that he was on very little sleep from the night before this discussion was recorded [693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=693.44s)

however we now find ourselves in a viral outbreak and daniel is one of the few people i deal with trying to make progress on how humans can have a permanent future on the small and dangerous planet particularly amidst the fatal temptations of nuclear and biological warfare which i have termed the twin nuclei problem elsewhere now the coronavirus may or may not turn [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=715.04s)

out to be related to laboratory strains but the problems it poses and foreshadows are directly within or adjacent to daniel's area of focus daniel in particular favors the wisdom and design branch of the human fate decision tree a branch that i think probably deserves the second most attention after my personal favorite which is the need for new physics with [736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=736.079s)

the possibility of escape to the distant cosmos that is daniel is searching for something like the wisdom needed to re-engineer a non-rivalrous or anti-rivalrous society to live in harmony with its new found god-like powers sometimes the search for a so-called escape through wisdom goes under the name of [[game b]] now the idea behind [[game b]] is something like the following natural and sexual selection must be assumed to have engineered us for a cycle of competition and misery which we might term game a played red of tooth and claw under the law of the jungle [[game b]] is by contrast a mythical second state where the agents originally built within game a teach themselves to do something far less brutal rivalrous [781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=781.6s)

unsustainable and wasteful but without themselves getting out competed by those who wish to remain in game a as such [[game b]] falls clearly within the confines of the so-called human potential movement while i have taken an interest in this counterculture i am not myself a part of it as i fear that it does not fully make [800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=800.959s)

sense to me that [[game b]] is really a possibility nevertheless the quest for a less rivalrous world is probably a noble one and one of which i'm at least partially personally supportive in any event i thought that this is the episode that is probably most in keeping with the semi-apocalyptic mood that many of us find ourselves within during these days [820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=820.24s)

of quarantine i don't know if it will be everyone's cup of tea but i think daniel has many interesting perspectives and it is a pleasure to introduce him to our portal community so please sit back and relax as we bring you an uninterrupted discussion with daniel schmokenberger music hello you've found the portal i'm your host eric weinstein and today we'll be sitting down with a name that will not be familiar to many of you my friend daniel schmokenberger daniel welcome to the portal thanks for having me eric so daniel i have to admit that um the way in which i came to know you was a little bit odd i would start to talk about various [865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=865.519s)

ideas and people would simply say to me that's really interesting have you ever talked to daniel schmokenberger and so far as i knew you weren't affiliated with any famous institution you did not have a large outreach into the public [885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=885.04s)

and yet somehow my network was very attuned to your thinking do you have any sense of what it was that caused your name among all names to come up frequently in context that we share well i think we just we do happen to have some good friends in common and people who have similar interests in [910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=910.24s)

terms of how to do better thinking how to make civilization better make society better um concerns about civilization risk and probably mostly have friends that appreciate heterodox thinking but clear heterodox thinking and yeah my my goal was never a lot of broadcast my goal was to communicate with people that i also thought were earnestly endeavoring to think well and see if we could think better about things and maybe make progress on things together well i suppose that the way i i view it is that there are very few people at the [952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=952.24s)

moment who are really trying to integrate any kind of rigorous thinking across many different disciplines to solve what i would think would be society wide problems and opportunities for everybody and i find that very surprising because we keep being told what a prosperous society we are [974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=974.399s)

you would think that in a prosperous society there would be lots of people experimenting with radically new ideas about societal organization at any given time given that so much is on the line whenever we talk about climate or multipolar geopolitical conflict it seems very strange that there are so [996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=996.959s)

few people who are interested in what i would think are effectively existential questions for humans do you find first of all that um you think that that our our world and our society is thinking properly about where it is at this point in human history uh no i obviously don't think that we're thinking very well about it most any of the schools not the kind of environmental reactionary not the left not the right not the techno technocapitalists singulatarian optimists i think there is some signal and a good bit of noise and [1043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1043.679s)

also not just epistemic bias but episemic inadequacy coming from whatever domain specialty looking at something that's so much more complex than any domain specialty by itself is going to do a good job of um i think you speak well to why there are not more different ideas [1062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1062.16s)

trying to figure things out is you end up getting some kind of dominant system that is autopoetic it's self-perpetuating and so then it you want to say what what you mean by autopoetic uh yeah self-perpetuating self-authoring and so let's and when we say system it's like [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1083.44s)

what system are we talking about the academic system are we talking about the monetary system are we talking about our government system are we talking about culture we're talking about media and information communication and it's yes it's the intersection of all those into a kind of civilizational system and that i think can be best thought of if we want to think of it in simple terms as the system that confers power to things and so of course everything that supports that system gets more power within the system and everything that would possibly threaten the core relevancy or validity of the system [1122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1122.16s)

threatens people who are doing well in the system and so it gets kind of spit out by the system and so i think that's a very strong normative force all right so let me let me give a little bit of my frame we can try to pass things back and forth and feel free to take over if you like but here's what i see that i think of as [1144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1144.24s)

being really interesting and rather mysterious i see a decision tree in which i think at a society-wide level i can't accept any of the major branches so one branch would be that we we have a self-extinguishing human event let's say an all-out nuclear war where people miscalculate and the planet is unrecognizable [1164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1164.559s)

then there's a a different branch that says that there's some sort of a environmental collapse maybe with a nuclear exchange or some sort of synthetic biology who knows what where there are survivors but it's not it's not the world that we're we see out our window here then there's another one which says maybe we managed to trundle on for another [1187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1187.12s)

thousand years somehow limping along without any major new ideas we're still using markets things are getting incrementally better maybe they're some big breakthroughs here and there but there's no big breakthrough in human wisdom so that we have the same dangerous objects but we continue to be lucky that [1205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1205.2s)

nobody weaponizes these things and that there's no broad collapse then there's an escape branch where we we end up on mars or maybe we escape even farther out in the universe or maybe we get uploaded into silicon there's no part of this tree that looks sensible to me every single branch is somewhere in sci-fi um are you seeing something that looks like that or do you have some branches [1231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1231.12s)

that you think are more probable and more helpful um more hopeful yes probable no but i can't do a probability calculation because they're unprecedented so i don't have priors you have to you have to impute yeah so the first two that you said [[existential risk]] and [[catastrophic risk]] there's certainly lots of different ways for both of those to occur that get that are getting increasingly likely as time goes on as i model it and i think we should get into that um the idea that it continues relatively similar to how it is for a thousand years i don't see possible at all and i can say why i think this [1266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1266.08s)

civilization system is actually [[self-terminating]] in a much shorter time than that inexorably like there is no way that it could continue for very long and so uh the escape models i'm fairly dubious of not because we couldn't with near-term tech get some people into space but we certainly couldn't get [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1287.6s)

something that doesn't depend on earth that if we things up here it's doing well within the time frames that i think will things up on earth um at least the trajectory as i see it so then the question you ask is there some other thing like uh progress to a totally different type of [1306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1306.24s)

[[social system]] here or totally different type of civilization system that can continue for a long time that isn't [[self-terminating]] and that isn't generating catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] as the byproduct of the architecture of the system itself is really the only path so you know what i spend most of my time working on is what the architectures of [1327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1327.6s)

a system like that must be and what the transition would look like so i'm i'm quite happy with that description and that also sort of sets up what uh at least our initial superficial division is that is that of the branches of the decision tree that i can't accept um the most hopeful branch to me [1348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1348.48s)

is that we learn our source code and use it to do something that has never been done something that has never been done before which is potentially travel outside the solar system or potentially through some as yet unknown physical possibility you have an idea about hacking [[social system|social systems]] with so far our biology the way it is in our our structure the way it is in our in our governance but somehow delivering us to a new structure i don't know whether that's going to be through human enhancement through a cultural change through reincentivizing the world [1393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1393.12s)

so am i right that those those those i i think that your branch of the decision tree is very interesting i just i'm very pessimistic about it and i think you should be pessimistic about mine well when you say hacking the source code you mean the source code of physics so we can get something like a warp drive and i'm down right like i'll [1411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1411.6s)

totally work with you on a galactic cruiser if we can do that i'm not saying warp drive but okay just as is a placeholder as a placeholder okay um i think the thing that i'm talking about also requires something like understanding source code at a different level sure not source code of physics but source code of things related to yeah psychology and [1433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1433.679s)

evolution and the nature of [[tool making]] and the nature of collective [[sensemaking]] and choice making type dynamics okay and but to start to go into what it would look like we have to do i would have to to have it make any sense describe what i think the problems are why the current system is [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1453.2s)

[[self-terminating]] and why all the systems that we have ever had have been [[self-terminating]] because god actually defined the problem properly to be able to say because that gives me necessary and sufficient criteria for what an adequate solution would have to address you're teeing up my next question which is take us through your reasoning as to why [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1472.799s)

we can't luck out over several hundred years and simply kind of bumble on as before okay a couple different ways of looking at this that all converge if we look at the kind of club of rome limits of growth [1495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1495.12s)

type model i think that this is more fundamental than we're used to thinking about so uh you and peter were talking the other day about the need for ongoing just say peter thiel for those who haven't seen the inaugural episode of the show talking about the need for ongoing economic growth so that we can stay in [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1515.84s)

positive some dynamics because if we don't have economic growth and people keep wanting more stuff then it goes zero-sum and that creates conflict um so just to to make sure that we're i'm understanding your terminology positive sum dynamics means that whatever the mythical pie of it keeps getting bigger yes [1535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1535.679s)

okay and i think that obviously we can go positive some and still have it all be captured by a few right like not actually have anything like appropriate distribution and we know that wealth has a power law distribution and there's some very fundamental things about why it's always going to have a power law distribution if it has social [1552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1552.64s)

architectures like we currently have i'm comfortable with this but by power law distribution we mean that the the winners are so much bigger uh as winners than than a let's say a normal probability a normal bell-shaped curve right would tell us the curve looks like this you have a few people who have almost everything [1570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1570.559s)

and most people have quite little and that as you know if we look at like the increase in wealth that has happened since the internet it has not been pretty evenly distributed over most of the people it's been you know increasing wealth and absolutely is there a name for the pie that's growing but where almost everybody's slice [1589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1589.679s)

except for a few people's uh is shrinking well i mean we could call it global gdp as one very simplified metric and we could say okay so we want global gdp to increase because that represents total goods and services that represent some way of thinking about value it's a really bad way of thinking about value [1610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1610.08s)

and i think we should discuss that okay um if obviously up until the [[industrial revolution]] there were about a half a billion people on the planet at most okay and then we go as soon as the [[industrial revolution]] and our ability to uh extract resources at faster than their reproduction amounts from the biosphere we go from half a billion people over whatever 300 000 years of homo sapien history to 8 billion people in almost no time at all and so that's like there's a real [1649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1649.6s)

issue there that is we are subsidizing our growth with savings accounts that are finite and there's a bunch of different ways of thinking about that but if we look at biodiversity loss or [[species extinction]] or growing [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean or any of these issues not just [[climate change]] we can see that we have we have a linear [[materials economy]] that takes resources from the earth unrenewably and produces a bunch of pollution waste heat whatever in the process of manufacturing transportation and then turns them into trash on this side and so we get both accumulation dynamics [1688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1688.32s)

and depletion dynamics and you can't keep running accumulation and depletion dynamics on a finite biosphere indefinitely okay now of course you see the the immediate next argument which is make a closed loop economy well that you you needed to burn fossil fuels for a period of time in order to become wealthy enough to figure out how to do [1712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1712.24s)

something clean green and sustainable right and so the idea is that these are really just intermediate phases and it looks pretty dirty and grubby now but in fact good news human ingenuity is boundless and so we'll just think our way out of whatever new problems we've created so we can all easily say we can't keep [1732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1732.159s)

running a linear [[materials economy]] with [[exponential growth]] on the planet that's pretty straightforward and that we're actually very near limits of our capacity to keep doing that on a bunch of different atomic cycles um so then we say okay well we have to go close loop where the new stuff that [1750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1750.48s)

we make comes from the old stuff the old stuff turns into new stuff and that we're able to do that closed-loop cycling of matter using renewable energy and so this is one necessary dynamic but this already doesn't look like the model that you're mentioning of society hobbling along mostly the same because that's actually really really different that would already be a significant [1770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1770.159s)

change not maybe as significant as a warp drive but it would be a fundamentally different type of civilization okay and so i would say that that movement to a closed-loop [[materials economy]] is necessary but nowhere close to sufficient um one one thing that's going to come is if i want to run anything like capitalism just from a [[materials economy]] basis where i'm going to have to keep growing the capital supply year over year just to keep up with interest right you there's an exponential expansion of the monetary basis that is required for capitalism to exist so then to not [1810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1810.88s)

debase the currency we have to keep growing the goods and services and i can't actually in a closed-loop [[materials economy]] that is near the carrying capacity i can't keep growing the goods and services indefinitely so then of course the argument is well we can do it almost all digitally and there's a bit of a complex argument but i would say there are some coupling coefficients between how much virtual value we have that keeps being valued that doesn't go into diminishing returns relative to how much physical value that there's some coupling coefficients between atoms energy and bits that make up the [[materials economy]] and then also time human attention so um i don't think that we can keep running a exponential capital expansion but i'll make a a simpler argument capitalism and nationalism but feudalism is also an example are rival risk game theoretic structures some in group competing [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1871.44s)

against somehow group and we can play coordination games where we'll coordinate with each other if it's more advantageous but we reserve the right to defect and go zero-sum on each other if that's more advantageous and we have been employing more and more powerful technology to play rivalrous games that means more and [1889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1889.36s)

more potent warfare more and more potent ex extraction environmental extraction and more and more potent information tech that can do narrative and information warfare narrative control something i would say is that rivalrous game dynamics necessarily are causing some harm in the system either i'm harming you directly you're harming me or we're externalizing harm to a commons [1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1913.84s)

and information or an ecological commons you can't keep externalizing harm exponentially and so rival risk game dynamics multiplied by [[exponential tech]] end up [[self-terminating]] we can't do exponential warfare exponential extraction or exponential disinformation we've already gotten so far with exponential disinformation that [1934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1934.32s)

we almost can't make sense of anything because you have a system that incents disinformation okay well this is the first place that i start to hear an argument that has a hope of dealing with the congenital institutional optimism [1953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1953.36s)

sure there are naysayers but i say that america's greatest days are in front of her have we not always found solutions to our problems and you know you cue the the brass band and everybody feels enlivened and i've always found these arguments kind of bizarre um not that things haven't worked out i think things have worked out to be honest [1974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1974.559s)

quite a bit better than i would have ever predicted if you'd put me down in 1945 and said what's going to happen over the next 50 years let's be honest we've been pretty lucky and it's been pretty pretty terrific on balance that said i also can't figure out a way in which we just become more powerful in our [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=1994.24s)

ability to extract our ability to confuse our ability to mete out harm from the strong to the weak so my guess is that even if i guessed wrong again and we could get another 50 years out of it sooner or later either something like what you're [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2016.96s)

talking about a change in the basic structure of rival risk interaction maybe we should talk a little bit about what what that means but i think people probably intuit it um or you know just requires an increasing amount of luck as we get farther away from the events that may have caused the [2035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2035.919s)

last 50 years i think that people who had direct experience of the depression in world war ii and maybe world war one they weren't fooled into thinking that this was an easy game and that life was simple they'd had enough primary experience with really catastrophic events that they knew that they were playing with the full stack [2059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2059.599s)

okay there's a there's a bunch of directions that i'm interested in going so one is world war ii was the first time that we actually had existential level technology as a species in our recorded history that's a big deal because we couldn't have actually blown ourselves up before then and in evolutionary time or even civilization [2078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2078.399s)

time that's just like a few minutes right like this not very long that we've had that i agree and if you read like if you read ellsberg's doomsday machine it is kind of lucky that we haven't blown ourselves up because there were a lot of just mistakes that should have blown us up right um but it's really hard to build nukes right it really takes [[nation state]] level capacity and mostly only a few [[nation state|nation states]] so you could do it yeah and this is the point is that if you only have a few actors that have nukes everybody can monitor each other and have something like [[mutually assured destruction]] to force an equilibrium but this is the thing about [[exponential tech]] is we don't just get exponentially more powerful tech we get exponentially more distrib distribution on powerful tech daniel i want to keep going with this but i'm going to keep slowing you down when you use a term that may not be familiar to a sufficient number of our listeners what do you mean by [[exponential tech]] so tech that helps us make better tech so we get a return curve on the technology so we see this kind of exponential very famously moore's law in computing we see this kind of exponential rate of growth of computing power because like nuclear bombs don't actually give us better insight into how to make nuclear bombs directly but computers give us better insight into how to make better computers and so there are different areas of [[exponential tech]] where the technology itself increases our capacity to make more of the technology or some underlying dynamic where we get some exponential increases in our capacity so [2173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2173.839s)

we can see for varying reasons exponential increases in compute power exponential increases in certain types of biotech like specifically things associated with like crispr genetic engineering gene drives nanotech and those things all you get exponentials also because there [2195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2195.44s)

we're dealing with things that could self-replicate right and so a nuclear bomb is a big deal but it doesn't self-replicate but a synthetic biology device can self-replicate or a genetically engineered thing can and so we can have [[exponential growth]] of the effect of something and so um if we if we take a look at the growth in uh biotechnology capacity we specifically look at breakthroughs like crispr tech and the capacity for things like gene drives to be able to modify foundational biology well that makes it to where biowarfare capacity like very high level [2238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2238.4s)

biowarfare capacity becomes much much much simpler so things that [[nation state|nation states]] used to be able to do non-[[nation state|nation states]] are gaining the capacity to be able to do even drone tech like we had the the first everybody's who's thought about it has been like when are we going to have a really big problem with drones and a [2256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2256.64s)

couple years ago was the first time in the ukraine where a commercial drone with a homemade thermite bomb dropped it on a munitions factory and because it hit a munitions factory and detonated the whole thing you get a billion dollars of damage from just i mean there can be one person doing a very simple thing in their garage without any kind of really traceable [2273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2273.599s)

exotic materials but we can do we can we can do much worse things than that uh exponentially increasing technological power so the main thing when i say [[exponential tech]] is just we're getting an exponential increase in how powerful the choices we make can be and that's a good way to think about technology as a lever on our choice [2296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2296.48s)

making right so no technology at all i can make different choices if i want to be violent i can hit somebody stone tool allows me to extend my hitting capacity and hit much harder right a gun takes that much further and an intercontinental ballistic missile takes that much further which it's a similar type of choice to make which is solve this [2316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2316.16s)

problem through violence extended by a much much bigger lever and what i would say is if you look at the kind of people we have ever been like look at the romans look at the sumerians look at the minds look at any kind of people we've been and look at the distribution of ways we've made choices take any of those people and give them [2335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2335.52s)

exponentially more power factoring how they've used their power and they self-terminate like they they don't use they're not good stewards of power and well i agree that we're not good stewards of power i think that there is a mystery here that if we don't make eye contact with it it's going to dog the conversation [2353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2353.68s)

we've got a lot of missing stinger missiles i believe from the afghan theater during the time that we were arming the mujahideen i don't know how many but i think i heard that it was in the hundreds uh yet we didn't see a ton of use maybe you know twa flight 800 had something to do with it maybe not we don't know [2375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2375.92s)

it's a mysterious situation um there are plenty of reservoirs to poison people always talk about that we haven't seen that behavior it seems to me that um these terrible shootings that we experience i'm always astounded that the numbers are as low as they are and you could make an argument that said that in general [2399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2399.359s)

people who are not in a position to benefit who are engaged in some sort of [[self-terminating]] activity people who are planning to go out with a with a bang if you will um are not very successful usually in doing huge amounts of damage now that [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2419.76s)

may change so like we know that from the murrah federal building that fertilizer is a pretty potent bomb ingredient and yet we didn't see a huge uh string of copycats after that is there something in us that is sort of capable um in an act of desperation and depression of killing tens of people that struggles to kill thousands or millions i you understand the question is a mystery yeah i think there's some positive things we have going for us which is there generally tends to be an inverse correlation between people who are really good at tech and [2470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2470.56s)

people who want to blow things up like typically those the people who want to blow things up mostly don't figure out how to make really good bio weapons right and the people who are really engaged in how to make more powerful breakthroughs in science and tech are usually engaged in some creative enterprise where they're not [2491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2491.52s)

oriented to blow things up that's actually like really important i think that's going well for us i think that depends upon certain social things staying in place that we can't guarantee are going to stay in place um a relatively viable society for the people who have the technological capacities [2510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2510.48s)

i this is something that fascinates me we seem to be very willing to destroy the lives of very capable people these days yeah i mean i i and i always wonder like are we going to be surprised when somebody whose life we've ruined over nothing comes back at us and saying wow you really you wrote me off and you [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2535.2s)

destroyed my reputation my ability to earn a living i can't have a security clearance i can't do what it is that i enjoy doing and now i'm on the outs uh i am terrified for example than you know the famously the james demour situation where you start going after very bright sort of spectrum-y people [2555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2555.119s)

and you tell them that they're horrible and you ruin them publicly that's a very bad recipe i think it is a bad recipe and um and of course james damore is not a particular risk but there are a lot of people who are very capable yeah who took one look at that situation and said oh so now no longer can i be can i count on getting things uh largely right maybe i get some stuff wrong around the edges but no longer can i count on making interesting points and having a job uh when i get up the next morning well like when you're mentioning shootings if i can just go buy an ar-15 even if i don't know how to make one [2601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2601.04s)

right then i can kill a lot more people than i can with a knife right and so the that's an increase in technological capacity that can empower someone who is psychologically damaged somehow to be able to do things they couldn't do without it and i think as more powerful technology requires less scientific insight to be [2620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2620.079s)

able to uh modify then you're certainly going to see more of those types of dynamics increase i think one of the other things is that when we think about the cold war we really had two nuclear superpowers that could be locked in [[mutually assured destruction]] because with just two forces you kind of have an [2641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2641.68s)

easy nash equilibrium but as soon as you have a lot of forces and it's more multipolar it's a much much harder thing this is the thing that terrifies me which is that i would much rather have two very skilled hyper-lethal powers um in some kind of weird community game theoretic communication with each other [2661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2661.839s)

then lots of less skilled players with much less power but significant ability to do damage right which we have and we have increasingly so right so we went from one country with nukes at the end of world war ii to then too quickly in cold war type dynamics to [2683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2683.839s)

you know whatever nine on record if you don't count where all the missing uranium from the ussr that is in whatever places that it's in that and that we're not just talking about nukes we're talking about lots of other things so i think um i think the gist is that [2701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2701.2s)

rivalrous type dynamics whether we're talking about a rivalry that's a kinetic warfare like this right like a physical warfare right or an economic warfare or an information warfare end up resulting in progressively more harm as we have more power because the gist is if we're in some kind of warfare of whatever kind [2722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2722.72s)

then i need to figure out some asymmetric capacity to be able to beat you but the moment i deploy that asymmetric capacity it gets reverse engineered by all sides and up ratcheted so we get this exponential up ratcheting of the game the power itself yeah if it doesn't in the game right and and that's what we see is we see an [2744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2744.48s)

exponential increase in destructive capacity without a fundamental change in the basis of how we use it so let's just look at information tech for a moment and i think this is really key to the how we change civilization part if information about reality is a source of competitive advantage like from i [2767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2767.04s)

know where the water is and so but we don't think there's enough for everybody so not only do we want to withhold that information from the other tribe we want to misinform them as to where it is so they don't accidentally find it right you see in every competitive game whether it's a poker bluff or a football game where you fake one way and go the [2785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2785.2s)

other way a incentive to disinform right and as we start having exponential information text so we can intentionally disinform specific audiences in ways that are much more believable to them so you talk about rational conjugation russell conjugation is do you wanna i don't know that we've talked about it [2804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2804.88s)

too much on this program you do a great job with it i since you're gonna take it somewhere why when do you say a little bit about what it is i can disinform without even lying yeah right i can formally lie but i can also just make someone more likely to interpret something in a particular way by [2823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2823.92s)

couching a question or couching an idea in a way that's likely to bring a reaction so you gave i think a great example of if i talk about illegal aliens the problem of illegal aliens versus um the need for amnesty for migrant workers undocumented workers undocumented workers then [2843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2843.2s)

just the nature of the wording choice on the exact same reality evokes very different kinds of sensibilities in people so they'll vote differently they'll poll differently so it's pretty easy to influence what people think and how they feel through of course lying but also through not just lying but sharing partial data so the [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2862.88s)

preponderance of data gives them a sense of things it is other than it really is and through things like russell conjugation where we're really just kind of hijacking their limbic system a very fun very funny one is the use of the democrat party where you emphasize the word rat rather than saying the democratic party [2882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2882.72s)

and so it's great fun for republicans to say yes the democrat con you know it's like whoa that doesn't sound good um and yet it's a defensible position what are you talking about that's just the way i say it right um okay so [[plausible deniability]] on engaging in a kind of [[narrative warfare]] right and it's supposed to be that we're both on team [2905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2905.839s)

usa right working together to make the best country possible maybe in rivalry with other countries but hopefully even in some kind of economic trade prosperous relationship right but we're obviously not both on team usa we're actually engaged in really dreadful zero-sum dynamics with each other while intentionally confusing and misinforming the public [2926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2926.24s)

and increasing animosity even towards the point of civil conflict for some game theoretic win for our team and we see that that's not just true with republican and democrat but even like multiple intelligence agencies it should be sharing intelligence perfectly with each other but they're actually [2948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2948.72s)

competing for who gets a larger percentage of the black budget so they'll withhold information and maybe even engage in internal espionage all the way to just like corporate politics where people aren't really making a choice in a big corporation of what's best for the corporation as a whole they're making choices that are best for them and their boss their fielty [2965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2965.599s)

relationships in and then engaging in corporate politics it might actually be hurting the company so long as they can have [[plausible deniability]] to get away with it so whenever we have [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] we're going to have some situation by which we're being incentivized by a system of selective pressures to do certain things that may [2983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=2983.68s)

not be in the stated interests or the you know whatever the directive is of our of our institution so the the directive is to do the business of the country but in fact you're loyal to the team that you're on because that's what brought you to this place and it were you to lose your team inside of this [3004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3004.079s)

internal game you couldn't really function yeah and it's actually not even the fault of some bad people it's a fault of a system where it's like i say okay well if i don't do that then i lose the game to the other guys that are doing that and i actually think i'm more qualified to get that promotion than he is so this is the compromise i have to [3021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3021.28s)

make which is which is this is another thing we could think of as politics right my brother is called this i think he did a beautiful job describing this um he called this the personal responsibility vortex where if you start behaving if you listen to people who say well you know even if you're incentivized to do [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3040.88s)

the wrong thing you should still do the right thing brett's point was if that becomes self-extinguishing then you'll simply be replaced by something less ethical than you are right so it's actually incumbent upon you not to be so virtuous that you remove yourself from the game leaving open a niche for some less scrupulous person to swoop in so this is [3060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3060.88s)

how an unethical system convinces ethical people to compromise their ethics to become a tool for the system well he's so this is this this big division that's coming up which is that what we call you know democracy and capitalism and the enlightenment and all of these [3082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3082.079s)

things that we've been able to do up until this point some people in our mutual world that might be vaguely affiliated with the human potential movement that's the closest giant umbrella rubric that i can put over it some percentage of those people refer to this world that we have now as game a [3102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3102.0s)

and then there's this hypothetical [[game b]] which might not be rivalrous and hopefully isn't self-extinguishing and it might not be entirely market-based or maybe the markets take into better account of things like uh resource questions and negative externalities uh are you are you hopeful about [[game b]] is that a good way of phrasing it is there a better way of talking about this yes and to be able to define what [[game b]] what criteria it must have understanding the thing that is self-extinguishing in game a like let's take a couple of the examples you just gave and go a little further [3150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3150.559s)

because they're they're right along the lines connected to where we were you talk about internalizing externalities right so if i if i am figuring out how to externalize some cost of the thing that i'm doing to the commons and so for example you're polluting as part of a furniture plant [3169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3169.359s)

that employs lots of people and makes something people need right so there's a real cost right there's a cost to a whole ecosystem and to the people into the future generations that will be affected by the pollution but i don't pay the cost and because i'm not paying the cost i get to have the profit margins that i have if i had to pay the cost which mean i had to [3189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3189.839s)

employ a technology that currently exists to clean all that up and whatever that costs my business might be radically not profitable right now so so then maybe we'll try and create a law to make it to where i can't do that pollution but i'm not doing the pollution as a person i have some corporation that has [3208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3208.72s)

some liability limiting functions of any of the people within the corporation so the corporation is breaking the law and you can't put a corporation in jail so there's a fine but if the fine is less expensive than processing the waste would be then it's just a cost of doing business and then the corporation will employ lobbyists to go change the law because laws are going to be created by lobbyists that are paid for by somebody and they're going to be created by politicians who have a campaign budget that is controlled by somebody so basically economics has [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] we try to create law to bind it but economics is deeper in the stack of power than law is so you end up getting this legal system that is supposed to bind the perverse economic incentive that mostly ends up legislating in the benefit of it so but this is a fundamental problem with the [[liberal democracy]] idea well when things get really visual things can actually change if you start being able to point to oh i don't know let's say children with malformed limbs that happened with thalidomide the visual on that was enough to push that up this the attention stack [3290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3290.16s)

to say hey we we've got a serious problem here and we've got to talk about this right now because the the externality of this pharmaceutical is is horrific um do you have anything better than waiting for absolutely horrendous things with the with visuals that that hit home yeah so you know it's funny right like we see ads from the 50s where better living through chemistry and people are spraying ddt on the kids to keep the mosquitoes off and then we recognize how lethal the ddt is so then we sell it to mexico that doesn't have the law and then we buy the produce back from mexico [3332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3332.319s)

but then we come up with some new chemical that we say is less toxic just because the long-term studies on its toxicity haven't come out yet and um mostly they don't look as visible as thalidomide this is the thing sometimes i say this as [3349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3349.28s)

um we keep searching for our own blind spot so that we can do business there right and so what it is that we can't measure very often becomes a place to do business because almost everything produces negative externalities and so it has to be disguised now this is a concept i wanted to bring up in terms of what you [3371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3371.04s)

were saying about your brother and so there's this idea of a [[multipolar trap]] which is some scenario where some agent in the system whether the agent is a person or a nation or a tribe or a corporation does something that is really bad for the whole over the long term but it's actually really advantageous to them over the near term [3394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3394.88s)

and if they do that they will get so far ahead of and use that power against everybody else that now everybody else has to race to do that thing and you get a race to the cliff so an [[arms race]] is a classic example right we really don't want a world with ai weapons it's a much less good world with ai weapons but we would have to ensure that nobody [3415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3415.68s)

makes them we'd have to make an agreement where if anyone doesn't join the agreement and says no we're going to make the ai weapon then everybody has to not only make them but also make the counter measures and race to make them faster and even if we make the agreement we're pretty sure the other guy is secretly defecting on the agreement in the [3431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3431.52s)

basement so we make the agreement while secretly defecting on in the basement while spying on them and trying to confuse their spies and it's like how the do we get out of that and the same is true the tragedy of the commons if i figure out how to externalize some of my cost and so my margins go up all of my competitors have to figure out how to externalize some cost or we have to [3448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3448.559s)

try and figure out how to make some lot of behind it but it's very hard to make laws to mine these things and so the same is true with ethical issues right if i am perfectly ethical i'm going to lose in politics because i won't be able to get anybody to support me whatever so i [3466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3466.48s)

make certain kinds of compromises and so one thing i would look at is if we want to look at [[catastrophic risk]] writ large we can look at [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] drive as a general game theoretic phenomena driving lots of different ways that [[catastrophic risk]] can happen so one thing [[game b]] has to do is solve multiple traps so in other words look at the universal class of such things rather than begin than getting bewitched by any particular instance correct but we have to solve for the class of [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] writ large because it's not just we don't want an [[arms race]] on ai weapons we also don't want an [[arms race]] on [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] or nanotech well i think it's well phrased does it buy us [3510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3510.16s)

anything does it buy us sorry i want to be clear not bias b-i-a-s but buy b-u-y us does it buy us anything in the sense of does that avoid [[catastrophic risk]] by itself or don't actually do it formulating deciding to work over the class yeah of really dangerous to use your language [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] does that actually point us to some game theoretic thing that all all of our friends who did the [[game theory]] of the cold war might have missed um i'm not aware of any major game theoretic advance in what you're calling [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] it's not a major game theoretic advance what we're saying is that we that that phenomena creates a lot of different [[race to the bottom]] type scenarios but with exponentially more power the [[race to the bottom|race to the bottoms]] are much deeper bottoms so in the past we've had boom and bust cycles associated with those right right [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3576.0s)

and so everybody starts doing the pollution thing until you get a bus that's associated which creates some new market advantage to clean the pollution up at a certain point because people are willing to pay for that and so you'll get these kind of boom and bust cycles that's kind of the best that a market can give you with regard to [3592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3592.48s)

[[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] but the level of bust that we get with exponential technologies and this many people basically is unviable and so we've never figured out how to solve for that class and i'm saying that that's one of the things you're asking is there a [[game b]] that i believe in it would have to solve for a number of things it would have to actually remove [[rivalrous dynamics]] which is which would solve for [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] because [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] are a situation where the well-being of each agent can be optimized independently of and even at the expense of the other agents in the [3629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3629.68s)

commons as long as that's the case we have an incentive to do up stuff with increasing power that is one way of thinking about an underlying generator of all the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] let's assume that i buy in because quite honestly this has been always been my problem with [[game b]] is that i look at the i look at the [[game theory]] and i look at our our history in terms of what has brought us to this this point and i would say that if you believe any version of the theory of natural and sexual selection you'd have to say that we are the product of an [[arms race]] and the idea that we would be wise enough to stop the [[arms race]] when i i can hear in my mind's ear all these people saying wow chicken little is at it again everything's great we you know stephen pinker tells us that we were in a much more peaceful world uh we won the cold war what are you guys going on about i mean things are a little bit screwy in politics and suddenly it's all gloom and doom i i just i hear that voice and then i hear this other voice which is this optimism about maybe we could become wise maybe we could become the people wise enough to have synthetic biology and [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and instant communication and data warfare and all these things and survive and thrive and i don't see [3716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3716.88s)

help me out where is the hope here i i think that you and i probably don't need to talk about this much but that what i would call a naive techno optimism um is bananas cherry picking data is easy from a big data set well and the great negative externality is [3740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3740.48s)

potential violence as long as you don't see potential violence as having increased um now you might i then you don't see the problem one argument you could make is that sub-lethal technology uh has increased our ability to shoot bean bags at protesters means that you [3760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3760.16s)

don't actually have to kill protesters you know that there are some weird arguments but what you you never lost the ability to kill them you just may have not outfitted uh riot police with uh lethal technology in their first in the first wave of things that you send against an unruly crowd and the most awesome thing like [3783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3783.119s)

about the current system is we don't even have to deal with protesters with tear gas or bean bags or whatever mostly because mostly addiction and student debt and information overwhelm and those things deal with the people adequately so they they don't actually understand enough or care enough or have the capacity to [3808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3808.319s)

organize very meaningfully we just legalize weed and make porn free and everyone's demotivated those are a couple examples okay um i think we need to talk you make it sound like a good thing like maybe maybe it's keeping this nothing over going critical no no no um i'm saying that [3830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3830.72s)

every dominant system has an intrinsic propensity to s figure out how to stay being the dominant system which means that it has a intrinsic propensity to get better at being able to deal with dissent and we can look at different kinds of [[conflict theory]] you and peter were talking about gerardian conflict we can [3857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3857.119s)

look at this as kind of a marxist class type conflict but i think it's it's deeper than that the system that is self-perpetuating is inanimate the system which is self-perpetuating is not itself animate or sentient but it is autopoetic but it is autopoetic and this is the fascinating thing to get is it's like let's take let's take nick bostrom's [3886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3886.64s)

paper clip maximizer as an analogy so i know you know this but for the people who don't when looking at concerning ai risk scenarios one of them is this you know kind of funny idea of a [[paperclip maximizer]] paperclip is representative of any widget so make an ai that basically can do two things it can [3906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3906.0s)

optimize the production of something here a paper clip and so it can use its intelligence to do that so it can make more efficient [[supply chain|supply chains]] whatever and it can use its intelligence to increase its own intelligence so you'll get a [[exponential curve]] on intelligence which also then means an [[exponential curve]] on its capacity to optimize whatever narrow metric it's optimizing and so of course after it just makes increases in efficiency which are awesome then it starts making so many paper clips that it needs new substrate to make paper clips out of and it eventually turns the whole world into paper clips because it can it can grow its intelligence to out compete whoever's competing for those paper clips faster than they can that's a very short version of it you're gonna say something well just i guess what i find very bizarre about all of this is that i live in multiple social worlds and intellectual worlds and in some of my worlds this stuff strikes people as loopy oh here comes the stuff about the agi the robots are going to kill us all [3968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3968.24s)

and in some other portion of my world it's like well clearly we're on the verge of agi and that's going to be the [[existential risk]] and this is in part to go back to your original point something that you and i share a failure a catastrophic failure of [3985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=3985.359s)

communal [[sensemaking]] right so what i've claimed is is that the revolution that we're in is is based around the idea that we don't have what i've called semi-reliable communal [[sensemaking]] we can't all agree now even if it's slightly wrong or maybe even deeply wrong as to what it is that we're seeing where we are in human history [4009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4009.52s)

what our issues are and so the first part of this decision tree that goes really wrong is that a lot of people think that we're in great shape okay so this is i i'm actually going to come back to the paperclip max manager because it explains why we don't have communal [[sensemaking]] if instead of thinking about an [[artificial intelligence]] that can increase its capacity while optimizing something we think of a [[collective intelligence]] that can some way that humans are processing information together in a group a market is a kind of [[collective intelligence]] right the whole idea of what the invisible hand of the market [4046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4046.72s)

the the market will figure out what stuff people really want it's expressed as demand and then which version of the various supplies is best i wouldn't say it's an intelligence it's not a central intelligence but the idea is that there is kind of an emergent intelligence there is an [[emergent property]] of this thing music and you know it computes things like prices and allocations and if that's what you mean by intelligence then that's what i mean yeah so it's it is a bottom-up coordination system that does end up having new information emerge as the result of the bottom-up coordination [4087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4087.119s)

okay and i can take a market as a as kind of at the center i can take capitalism at the center of the more general class of what i would call rival risk dynamics as a whole as a kind of [[collective intelligence]] because the thing that wins at the game of rivalry gets selected for and so there is this kind of learning of how to get better at rivalrous games [4108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4108.96s)

learning across the system as a whole which which things when in war which things keep more people believing the thing which keep people from attriting out of the thing like that that make sense yes and so i would say that we have if we just take the capitalism part [4130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4130.56s)

capitalism is a paper clip maximizer that is converting the natural world and human resources into capital while getting better at doing so so it goes from barter to currency to fiat currency to fractional reserve process to complex financial instruments to high-speed trading on those those are like the increase in its [4151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4151.6s)

capacity to do that but specifically now it is a incentive for all the humans to do certain things so if leaving the whale alive in the ocean confers no economic advantage on me but killing it and selling it as meat is a million dollars of economic advantage and if i don't kill it the whale still won't be alive because [4172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4172.4s)

somebody else is going to kill it anyways and then they might actually even use that economic power against me now i've got i have an incentive system that is encouraging all the humans to behave in certain kinds of ways and now not only do we need to kill the whales we need to race at getting better to do it and making better militaries and extracting [4189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4189.279s)

all the resources and so i see this as a kind of so if i'm understanding where you're headed what you're saying is is that the market is kind of a precursor to an agi it is a [[collective intelligence]] that is eventually [[self-terminating]] in the same way that a cancer is right the cancer cells are self-replicating and they're growing faster than normal cells but they end up killing the host which kills themselves and so the the reason i'm bringing this up in terms of collective [[sensemaking]] is those who do the will of capitalism like those who do the will of the [[paperclip maximizer]] molochs or on whatever kind of analogy we want to use here those who do well at the game of power get more power and then they use that legislative power media power capital power to make systems that to modify the systems in ways that help them more right [4251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4251.52s)

those who oppose the system of power also oppose those who are doing well at it so even though the system is inanimate the people who are doing well at it are animate so then they take those people out which is we see how martin luther king and gandhi and jesus and et cetera died people who actually opposed to the system of power right and so you end up having a system that [4272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4272.4s)

is selecting for or is conferring more power to those who are good at getting more power which ends up meaning who are selecting for conferring power to sociopathy yeah i i don't find this part of the argument [4293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4293.12s)

well maybe i'm just stuck somewhere dude okay let me music i think i'm on your side so i want to help make a different part of this case okay i think a lot of this comes down to magical thinking because of the non-use of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] uh against humans since 1945. [4312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4312.84s)

i think that one thing if 911 had been a nuclear attack rather than a weird conventional attack we would know where we were in human history and by virtue of our luck and our luck alone we are completely confused as to how perilous the present moment is because our luck has been amazing and if you believe surprising [4338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4338.32s)

yeah if you believe that somehow it can't be luck because it's this good then you believe that there's some unknown principle keeping us safe and it you don't know what the name of that principle is maybe it's human engine ingenuity maybe it's um some sort of secret collective that keeps the world uh sensible maybe it's that markets have tied us all together i don't know what your story is yeah but whatever your story is it's wrong and it's it's obviously wrong right the the the idea that we didn't have anything like 911 and then we had a sudden 911 kind of attack is itself paradigmatic [4381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4381.92s)

that these things with which you have no data familiarity i mean look there was no suicide bombing in the modern world before the 1980s and i think this is the point is that um it's generally more advantageous within a market to believe that markets are good and the world is healthy and things are awesome i'll usually do better in [4405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4405.92s)

academia if i say academia is good right it's a point that you make if i really criticize it heavily i'm going to get less tenderness this is peter's point more than my point okay yeah i will usually do better in markets if i say they're awesome and do better in a corporation if i say it's awesome and so there is kind of an incentive for optimism about the dominant system if i want to do well in the dominant system and if i have critiques of the dominant system i'm usually going to do less well in it which means less power will get conferred to those ideas and so there's kind of a memetic selection right like the memes that that do well end up being the memes that [4442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4442.32s)

propagate but do well within a current system well look this is why i've called for uh a return to above ground nuclear testing because my belief is that we you laugh but i'm not kidding i mean if we don't get our amygdalas really engaged with where we are this magical thinking which by the way i [4462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4462.88s)

suffer from this magical thing i'm not it's not something i'm claiming everyone else has i have the idea that nothing too bad can can come that you know i always ask this this weird question which is how many foreign nuclear devices are currently on u.s soil people always think about that nukes will have to come through an icbm i'm not at all convinced that that would [4482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4482.159s)

have to be true people just don't think about these things because we've been in such a rare period of time that these things haven't like everybody who's talked in these terms sort of to me like there's a part of me that sounds like okay well that's the kind of a conversation you have on on a dorm [4501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4501.44s)

uh floor during a bowl session like grownups realize that something is keeping the world together which is funny right because it's basically saying grown-ups have bought into magical thinking exactly yeah and so and by the way a lot of the people that i think of as being the smartest most interesting people have not bought into this magical thinking what has happened is is that those people have been pushed out of the institutions that form this sort of weird conversation that i refer to as the gated institutional narrative and the [4537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4537.36s)

depopulation of dissenters like really serious dissenters from inside the institutional complex is one of the defining features of our age to me but something that you can't get any commentary on because the commentary you're really looking for is is that conversation so [4558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4558.32s)

what i just try to do is to show people that no matter what you do the gated institutional narrative cannot look at certain very basic facts right so you get a very dangerous kind of group think there and even if someone disagrees with it they have a lot more incentive to not publicly disagree with it [4578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4578.8s)

within that group things like those people i mean this is why we're doing the portal podcast which is um let's be honest this is pirate radio yeah and i don't know why it hasn't been shut down at the moment the best thing that the gated institutional conversation has going for it is that all of these interesting people are simply humans and you can destroy any human reputationally and so the cheapest thing to do is not to kill anybody right but just as as somebody starts to accumulate mind share the gated institutional narrative goes into into hyperdrive and it just starts pumping out [4619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4619.679s)

fear uncertainty and doubt which is the you know fudd is the major tool for destroying an individual's ability to communicate reality yeah something i think about is the people who went through what happened in syria recently or say [4639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4639.679s)

collapse in libya or wherever where you had an actual pretty developed nation that didn't also expect that it was going to go through war and collapse and then it did i bet that if we talked to those people they would have a very different intuition for the state of the fragility here because they actually have first-person experience it's something [4660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4660.48s)

that seemed really stable and like it wasn't going to collapse actually did and most of us haven't actually been through anything like a collapse in our life and we don't have a good intuition for things that are only in history books and so this is a place where intuition by itself like our intuition is informed by our experience but our experience is very short right and if we study past civilizations one of the things we know and you know we can read tainter and the collapse of complex societies or you know other kind of good insights on how [[civilizational collapse]] works but none of the previous civilizations are still [4698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4698.0s)

here like that's that's one of the important things to get is that they go through a life cycle and that they mostly collapse for self-induced reasons and that even if someone else overtook them oftentimes the group that overtook them was smaller than rivals that they had fended off previously because they [4714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4714.8s)

had already started going through institutional collapse or [[civilizational collapse]] and if we look across all of them there are some things we can generalize about what leads to [[civilizational collapse]] but i think the difference now versus any of those other times is that due to globalization yeah in some ways the us and china are different civilizations [4733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4733.44s)

but both of them would fail without each other currently and like we don't make our own computational substrate we don't make our own lots of things right like they don't do their own fundamental well but the science part of the hope of the but the architects of many of these systems believed [4750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4750.239s)

that a kind of economic [[mutually assured destruction]] was the best way of producing i think that's been true you well so i was going to bring up the case of europe so one of the arguments for the european experiment is that you europe is actually arguably the world's [4771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4771.04s)

most dangerous region people are very competent and there are long-standing rivalries and hatreds and you had some desire to create something that seems impossible which is a united states of europe and nobody was going to sign up for that so how do you do that well you back you back them [4795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4795.28s)

into a financial union without political union you give them their ability the ability to issue their own debt but not an ability to print their currencies and then you wait for the collapse to come music and then in this storyline anyway you create [4814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4814.239s)

a federation which becomes a political federation the united states of europe is created because of a sovereign debt crisis and we sort of went through that which i believe was a was sort of a sought after outcome which is maybe hopefully people will print their own their own debt and uh they'll issue debt and they won't be able to print their own currencies in order to inflate their way out of it ergo something positive will have to happen that seems to me to be also a recipe for disaster and that the architects of these plans seemingly died [4856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4856.32s)

and everybody's on autopilot not understanding you know i've seen this in in terms of certain u.s policies where people create a policy for reasons that nobody's really understanding and a short time later nobody even knows why the policy was created the real reason and to begin with do you see that this kind of a world i think that's actually one of the meaningful dynamics in institutional decay and in civilizational decay is that a new civilization is formed coming out coming out of a war or after a migration or through a famine or after like some really difficult thing yeah and to really be able to build something new took real capacities what you would call [4897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4897.76s)

the contact with the unforgiving right like real empirical capacities and studied my linguist a bit yeah and i think that's really good lingo because like the i can't i can't lie to physics and have it reward me for it right like either i can grow corn or i can't grow [4918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4918.639s)

corn either i can win at a war or i can't but there's a real situation and so often times when we go from non-wartime where the generals are politicians to wartime where the politician generals who maybe suck at war start losing battles and we cycle through looking for ones who are good at it then we get some who are actually good at war [4937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4937.36s)

those difficult situations select for real empirical capacity but when you don't have those difficult situations then you're actually selecting for who can do politics best which means convince everyone of something whether it's true or not well this is what i call sharp minds versus sharp elbows yeah and so you have the people who are at [4955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4955.679s)

the beginning of figuring out how to do some new civilization and those people had some capacity to be in direct contact with reality and figure stuff out and then oftentimes what they pass on is the stuff they figured out but not the psychology in them and the capacities to figure stuff out to the [4975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4975.199s)

[[generator function]] of the civilizational models lost and so now we start getting copying errors and people are hopefully trying to at least copy it earnestly so now we've got a constitution or a set of law or a set of market practices or whatever it is but we don't really understand how we generated that effective thing and so that also means that as the [4996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=4996.4s)

environment changes we won't be able to adapt it adequately and that also means that we're not going to know how to deal with failures of it so then some people recognizing that start realizing that they can do better by defecting on the system and kind of preying on it than by participating with the system and so and this is what we think of as corruption right where they can uh start maximizing their own bonus structure or do a back-end deal or whatever and so long as it's adequately hidden they can get away with it and now that collapses the civilization even further so it goes from loss of [5032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5032.639s)

[[generator function]] to copying errors to incentive for internal defection and disinformation and you know i like i think that every civilization has faced this a loss of intergenerational knowledge transfer because it's not just the knowledge it's the [[generator function]] of how but it's also the case that [5051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5051.12s)

um real knowledge i think has become too dangerous to transmit and real knowledge doesn't know what the social norms are and you know certainly the biological world [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5071.12s)

is so disturbing i mean there's no corner of the biological world that you can look at and not come away thinking wow that's incredibly disturbing and what we're seeing right now a situation in which we can't cope with any discussion of biology every single attempt to have a real biological discussion given all of the social issues that it would bring up immediately ends in madness i've just seen no ability to talk real biology in public and so this is the earliest place where i can see here's a subject a science that actually can't be discussed i don't have anything in particular in mind there's just you know like you know bob trevor's work [5114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5114.239s)

on parent-child conflict if we have a beautiful story about how mothers would do anything for their children and somebody comes along and says no it's actually a struggle where mothers want to hold on to their resources because they're going to have many children and the child attempts to gain as much resource as possible without regard for the mother that's so [5132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5132.719s)

against the hallmark card version of motherhood for mother's day that we can't have a discussion about parent-child conflict in biology it's not that one isn't about gender it's not about race it's not about you know power dynamics it's about it just immediately runs into one of our cherished nonsensical points of view [5152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5152.56s)

or that the market is self-correcting the market is always self-correcting and knows best that the leading thinkers are all sitting in institutional chairs uh that every previous civilization was uh the hobbesian bias brutish nasty short dreadful lives and that everything is awesome just in the last little bit because of this system so don't [5173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5173.84s)

criticize the system actually so this is the the weird thing that i'm i'm finding is that you can't start interesting conversations not only about the pessimism of the impending collapse if we keep this up but about the optimism about well what might we do differently like we can't get energized to actually use this period of time [5195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5195.199s)

to do something novel and interesting and hope okay so think about this the you know the definition of infidel for kind of a jihadist ideology is anybody that's not supporting the jihadist ideology the definition of which to the crusaders was kind of a similar thing right the i have a friend who um went and looked at a bunch of the intelligence agency documents in yugoslavia and some of the baltic nations that had been declassified after the ussr collapse specifically regarding how the intelligence agencies influenced the definition of psychiatry and their equivalent of the dsm and so [5232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5232.08s)

there was something like their definition diagnostic and statistical manual for psychology which tells you when somebody is maybe has a personality disorder or neuroses you remember the previous definition of female mania during the victorian period right which basically translated to she had a sex drive and so that was like a mental illness and [5250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5250.639s)

um but uh so they their definition of something that translated to schizophrenia the first symptom was had negative feelings about the state and the second symptoms might take a while to show up and so what i think happens is that the dominant system ends up eating psychology and saying that the psychology that supports the dominant system is healthy psychology and anything that is dissenting to it's not healthy it ends up eating spirituality and virtue and ethics and academia and whatever to basically say the the behaviors that support the system are good so the thinking that supports those behaviors is good and [5288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5288.32s)

anything that's dissenting is bad and like it's so easy to see it in the crusades or in jihadism or even in victorian time period it's just very hard for us to see it about ourselves now but i think that's actually like one of these fundamental things in terms of you're saying like why don't we have group [[sensemaking]] is because you have a you have a self-perpetuating system that includes the self-perpetuation of the memes that support the system i understand well look i also have i ask it not because i have no ideas why we don't have communal [[sensemaking]] um what i'm confused by is why we are not more successful [5332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5332.32s)

people in our group and i i mean this in a relatively large and inclusive sense because you and i come from different corners of this large collection of people i think people are relatively well spoken some of them have fancy degrees some of them have made money some of them have become relatively well known for [5351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5351.92s)

their their thinking and yet that institutional conversation i i mean i always liken it a bit to the difference between wrestling and professional wrestling where in the institutional conversation you need to know what's going to happen ahead of schedule so that you can know whether you're [5372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5372.8s)

going to have that part of the conversation or not or whether it's going to be that the private conversation that we can't talk about versus the public a conversation in this concept that i've called split level argument other people have called martin bailey style tactics where you have some version of the argument that you can [5390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5390.719s)

make in public and then you have some other argument that you really have to is governing why you're saying and doing what you're doing all of these things lead to this very unhealthy situation whereby there is no communal [[sensemaking]] there is a gated institutional narrative it seems to be decaying [5412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5412.239s)

progressively year by year nobody is suddenly coming up to me and saying wow i think cnn and fox are doing a great job this year where's the hope where does this get fun and when do we get a chance to to find a portal to a to a better world as you see it most likely yeah well i want to start by saying i think this is important right i think that you [5438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5438.08s)

doing this it as a portal to a better world where you are supporting earnest thinking that is outside of institutional context and maybe heterodox but at least earnest and seeking to be well grounded um and the fact that people are interested in it i think is really important when [5457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5457.84s)

we come back to the difference between personal incentive and collective incentive right you say why aren't we more successful obviously it's like okay so what is the incentive for someone to agree with us um the for the most part expressing these things would make them do less well at politics in their job and maybe even their social club and [5478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5478.159s)

maybe even be part of the in-group that they're part of whether it's the left or the right or the whatever it is because then they would be saying things that there's almost no in-group that they would be aligned with or very very small and so you still end up having that there's more selective pressure for the individuals to continue to be part of [5498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5498.639s)

institutions even and institutional authorities if it doesn't make sense here's the part that doesn't make sense to me and very kind of you to say what you just said let's imagine that you have perfect sat scores you kept your nose clean your whole life you've gone to harvard and [5518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5518.639s)

yale you've got a position where you're commenting as a professor with a column in a major publication if that person for example calls me uh alt-right you know or uh i i don't know i mean like i have a [5540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5540.0s)

jewish last name i voted for bernie there's some point where that person's self-esteem i would imagine they would be so embarrassed to put their life's accomplishments at risk by just being obviously stupidly wrong like it just there seems to be no bottom at the moment okay so this is [5563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5563.28s)

this is important about obviously stupidly wrong i understand obviously stupidly wrong when your ability to demonstrate your power is to go out in the public square and say the dumbest most ridiculous most obviously incorrect thing you can think of and nobody says a word yeah well one of the things i find interesting is you know if we ask a question like even what's actually causing coral die off how much of it is temperature versus ph versus nitrogen messing up the phosphorus cycle versus trophic cascades right how long do we have before the coral die off what are the consequences of that you know like really important questions right or what are the actual what really [5611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5611.84s)

happened in north korea like why there was such a change just recently and what are the actual tactical nuclear capabilities that they have or or how much leakage actually occurred at fukushima or like any of these things nobody knows and you'll hear different narratives and you'll hear kind of equally compelling disagreeable [5630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5630.239s)

narratives on those yeah and almost no one has the time or the will or the epistemic capacity to really figure that out so one point is the [[sensemaking]] is actually hard you have a situation in which a lot of these things are complex enough and there's so much disinformation that when people try to actually figure [5653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5653.36s)

it out they just get a they get a information overwhelm and then it's very hard for them to continue so when you're saying like obviously stupid well there aren't there's a lot of places where people can hold a train of thought that seems cogent enough even if it's in direct opposition with another cogent train of thought and like just the [[plausible deniability]] that it might be one of the true ones since nobody can really sense make seems to be enough and so this is one of the really tricky things is in a world where if i have the incentive to disinform yeah at various different levels right and then i have exponential information tech so i can do exponential disinformation now this is when i say that the system's inanimate i [5698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5698.0s)

need to give this example everybody who's seen tristan harris's stuff will know this but if we think about disinformation via the nature tristan harris is a mutual colleague he heads a movement called time well spent and he's trying to show you that your attention has been [5716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5716.08s)

effectively weaponized against you where the big tech platforms are figuring out how to keep your eyeballs on their system right to your detriment right center for humane technology you can see stuff but like i think i think a lot of people know that news stations as for-profit companies have to make [5736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5736.159s)

money right and they make money by monetizing attention and basically they they sell advertising and the advertisers pay more the more people who are watching for more total minutes so the incentive of the news station is to make stuff that is both inflaming and scary and entertaining and whatever it will engage people to spend a lot of time watching it [5760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5760.48s)

and to not say things it would not be to the advantage of the advertisers that can afford to pay for them right so they have like they have an incentive to not share really complex nuanced things that will have most people click off but to share things if i see i don't buy this daniel i really don't okay let me give you an argument one of the things that i say that i think people find interesting is is that i believe the national academy of sciences and the national science foundation effectively conspired against american scientists and engineers on behalf of scientific and engineering employers that's a fascinating story i shout it in the public square now [5798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5798.32s)

you know i've been asked four times to the national academy of sciences to discuss this so they are certainly taking this quite seriously i've talked to the actual people who are involved with this it is amazingly interesting you could sell clicks you could you could just [5817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5817.28s)

get advertisers to buy for the clicks on this story nobody's going to run the story nobody has run the story in i don't know more than 20 years it's sitting there on servers i don't believe that this is all being driven by profit i believe that there is some force that we don't understand that keeps the gated institutional [5837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5837.84s)

narrative gated yes i think profit is one part of it that's why i say we have to think of profit as one aspect of kind of power or rivalrous dynamic more largely because it's i think government or academia or religious or cultural groups or profit can all influence the nature of narrative and information i think there's an economy of shame and terror say more about that i believe that the real reason that this works the way it does is we have not even gotten to a very basic point where it is considered acceptable to say i want immigration restricted now i point this out because i think it's very funny most people who want immigration restricted enjoy food from other cultures they they have friends who come from other places they enjoy travel there's nothing xenophobic about them in general they are xenophilic yeah and the idea that you can be both xenophilic [5906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5906.639s)

fascinated and interested in the world's cultures and want immigration to your country restricted and that this is the generic position that the average person holds this position is a story that appears nowhere so nobody has an idea that xenophilic restrictionists might be a plurality or a majority in the country because there is a rule that says anyone who calls for a restriction of immigration must be tarred as a xenophobe right and i think it's time to double dog dare the people who are keeping this level of discipline and say why can i why is it impossible to be a xenophilic restrictionist [5951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5951.6s)

what i think is is that the economy of shame is such that whoever acts first to make this point is in such danger for their livelihood their reputation that they are going to be tarred and feathered and one of one of the things that i'm trying to show people is is that you can you can make these points [5973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5973.119s)

now i can't do this on cnn but i can do this on pirate radio this is basically audio samastha to take the the russian underground mimeograph um movement uh as a as a template we can say things here but there's only a matter of time [5994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=5994.56s)

before this starts to become problematic to the institutional structure and it responds by debiting my account oh well that that's that alt-right guy yeah he seems disgruntled or you know he seems gloomy and out of touch and then the fear uncertainty and doubt campaign [6014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6014.4s)

starts and that's what is actually keeping everybody in line it's not that there isn't money to be made there's tons of money to be made what what's happened is is that it's been too easy to pick off the initial adopters i agree and i'm curious what your explanation of how that phenomena [6036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6036.159s)

emerged oh that's a really good so um let's really get into it we did have a dissension suppression um unit inside of the fbi uh which was called cointelpro and it tried to induce martin luther king jr to suicide through a letter from sullivan who was i think number one or number two maybe under hoover this thing lived inside of the fbi um it probably tried to tell john lennon that he was uh traitorous it tried to uh humiliate gene seberg who is a black panther supporter [6081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6081.92s)

by planning false information inside of mainstream media newsweek in the los angeles times it tried to get la cosa nostra to kill dick gregory the famous comedian and black civil rights leader so we did have a dirty tricks unit inside of the united states that needs to be known broadly um which was [6105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6105.36s)

pretty thoroughly investigated in the mid-1970s and once we saw that we were engaged in these dirty tricks against our own people um we were kind of shocked and flipped out and the economy wasn't in great shape and then ronald reagan came riding in and i think he pardoned mark felt uh who had been the head of cointelpro [6125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6125.84s)

after hoover but he was also deep throat and so you had this very strange situation that we got this reboot during the reagan years where we went back to some sort of more traditional more patriotic imagined version of our country and my belief is that in part [6145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6145.44s)

when bill clinton decided that he couldn't take yet another loss to the republican party he was going to start experimenting with republicanism inside of the democratic party by that point we had two parties that more or less were two flavors of the same thing i refer to the that collective as the [6166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6166.0s)

looting party and the looting party the neoliberals the neoconservatives sort of intergenerational warfare within the country in the u.s and my take on it is that the common ideology is that profit had to be found abroad and so you had to loosen the bonds to your fellow citizens [6189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6189.119s)

um and that's where all of this kind of the market always knows best we need to offshore and downsize and securitize what i've called the new gimmick economy so that right now we're waking up from the new gimmick economy and having never lived in anything really authentic unless we're quite old so my belief is is that during that period of time [6216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6216.8s)

there was very swift retribution for anyone who dissented famously a prominent trade theorist who was talking about the benefits of restriction of trade restrictions for infant industries let's say apparently got a call from one of the people high [6238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6238.0s)

up in the field say oh you seem to be a very bright young man it would be a shame if anything happened to your career and so this kind of idea suppression is the the hallmark well it is what i think [6256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6256.08s)

these two generations the baby boomers and the silent generation may become best known for in the future that this was a period in which new corrective ideas had to be suppressed because of the fragility of the system we saw the fragility breakout in 2008 we saw how vulnerable we were in 2001 [6277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6277.92s)

and we see that the the whole [[sensemaking]] apparatus is breaking down from the trump election so these have been the three moments when the gated institutional narrative has broken because it just got overwhelmed by events but other than that the key was making sure that people like you or like me or like peter [6302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6302.0s)

are not mainstream the cost of listening to us has to be driven to astronomical levels uh so we have to we have to look wild-eyed we have to um you know they can't call me uneducated if i have a harvard phd which is one of the funny parts of the system um but the idea is that you have to say [6322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6322.8s)

well you know maybe he used to to be smart but he's gone fringe so the the social cost it's amazing how effective such small amounts of that can be well it's also just funny i mean it just there's so many hours of audio of us and i was just astounded for example with the number of people who would try to portray let's say my brother [6348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6348.0s)

as right wing i mean from my perspective can you imagine making that decision that you have a guy as far left as brett and you're going to spend your credibility pretending that he's like allied with the nazis i just it doesn't even make sense to me because it's it's simply to me a way to incinerate your credibility and yet the way the system works is you incinerate people's viability it's economic warfare the if your reputation is damaged you can't be trusted you know and and that's how that's how [6388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6388.08s)

this this enforcement has worked so you asked me the question how does it work to keep this in line it's too trivially easy to destroy individuals and my question has always been is there a program which i have tentatively called no living heroes i don't know if you've heard this rift before charles lindbergh who is not a great [6411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6411.28s)

human being almost kept the us out of world war ii he said why is this why is this america's problem and if you think about it he had self-minted credibility in that he got into a plane and he flew it over an ocean solo and became a hero and that level of visibility allowed him [6433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6433.199s)

to compete with the state okay i think that there was a program after lindbergh that said individuals should not be able to amass sufficient mind share to affect the course of government policy and this is a question in my mind is there a program that got started that said we're going to wait and see if anything starts to bubble up it seems to have integrity it seems to have mind share it seems to be opposed to our policies and if and when we find such a thing it has to be redirected co-opted [6473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6473.119s)

destroyed reputationally or made ineffectual and the phrase that i really appreciated that was used about gene sieberg who was you know one of hollywood's uh great leading ladies of the time was we have to cheapen her image yeah this is the federal government talking about cheapening the image of a hollywood star because she was interested in in radical black politics sorry but now china reminds me when you were saying if when we look at biology it's disturbing when we look at history too and we realize that those people that did the crusades were genetically identical to [6511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6511.679s)

us and we think about the kind of civilized way that we want to think of ourselves that we wouldn't do something like have a government try and discredit someone but then we look at just how we have behaved as people throughout most of history and it's been like it's been pretty draconian through [6530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6530.56s)

most of it and i think we're at a time where having it more hidden has been useful but that doesn't mean that it hasn't still been happening what's very interesting to me is we go from we have these two phases the first phase is like you think people are still doing that [6549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6549.04s)

you have an overactive imagination then when it's discovered they say what you think that governments don't do this they've always done this and i've always watched as people get their cognitive dissonance to zero using two totally different um mental strategies do you find this of course yeah all right daniel assuming that we [6571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6571.199s)

are in some sense breaking out of this narrative that's been imposed institutionally and you're starting to be able to hear new voices is there an opportunity in some way to start hacking our way into a less rivalrous well let me try it again i'll start from the beginning so a little bit of gas i also had a little bit of gas all right daniel so if we agree that there's something a little bit bizarre about the extent to which there's been discipline in this gated institutional narrative and it's been hard to get kind of a different [6618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6618.8s)

message out uh to people that they need to start exploring new systems of organization maybe beyond market democracy who knows what what are the most hopeful systems that we currently have to use that that can be used to build even [6638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6638.88s)

better systems and how do we get that message out where do you see the hope in trying to confront the real problems we face uh to find and exit into our our next stage of human development so we've been talking about where there is incentive for disinformation or information [6660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6660.32s)

suppression or narrative suppression the the last chunk of things you were sharing um regarding shame was kind of a [[narrative warfare]] tool so a way i think of it and say there was a group that seemed like it didn't have power of one kind then it tries to find power of some other kind [6676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6676.639s)

so reconfiguring in groups competing with whatever tools they can against out groups but imagine if we could create a situation where there was no incentive for disinformation i'll talk about in a moment how i think we could do that and not just no incentive for disinformation but also no incentive for [6698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6698.48s)

information withholding and something pretty unique about humans is how good we are being able to add intention to signal lie but all the subtle versions right which is most of the signal that is coming to me is just bouncing off of stuff and reflecting and doesn't have that much disinformation in it [6718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6718.96s)

and obviously animals have cannif camouflage and strategies like that but every time we're communicating we are usually communicating towards some intention that we have and so i want you to think certain things were you thinking those things i think will advantage me but then to the extent that you take what i'm saying as adequately informing you like accurately informing [6742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6742.159s)

you about reality might not be right like there's a discrepancy between why i'm communicating to you and what would be maximum benefit to you so and even if we're not doing spin and russell conjugation disinformation even if it's just ip and trade secrets and information withholding this lowers our [6762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6762.239s)

coordination capacity to do interesting things tremendously and then there's so much coordination cost that goes into the competition so we say well let's imagine and we can i think we can say up to a tribal scale people did could do i'm not saying they always did i don't want to be romantic people could do a better job [6782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6782.719s)

of accurate information sharing because there was less incentive to disinform each other inside of a tribe because it would probably get found out and we actually depended on each other pretty significantly but the dunbar limit seems to be a pretty hard limit on that kind of information so you mean the supposed dun bar number that is the [6801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6801.28s)

limit of our ancestral mind or group to track the number of interactions we have so maybe maybe i can keep track of 200 or 300 people yeah not much more yeah whether whether it's 150 or 50 or 200 or whatever it is and you know i think we've attributed this to different things why tribes never got beyond a certain scale within a certain [6826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6826.719s)

kind of organization and if they would start to they would cleave and then if they were going to get larger they had to have a different kind of organization i think how one thing that we commonly think about is a kind of a limit of care and tracking right up to that number up to 150 people or whatever i can actually know everybody pretty well they can all [6847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6847.36s)

know me and if i were to hurt anybody i'm hurting the people that i've known for my whole life so something like universal interest of that group or almost like a commun communalist idea makes sense if there's no anonymous people and there's no very far spaces where i can externalize harm i basically can't externalize harm in the social [6866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6866.719s)

commons when i know everybody well i also probably can't lie and have that be advantageous i think there's another thing which is there's a communication protocol that anyone who has information about something within that setting can inform a choice where that information would be relevant that the tribe would be making because they can actually communicate with everybody fairly easily and if there's a really big choice to make everybody can sit around a tribal circle and actually be able to say something about it and as you get larger you just can't do that and i think there's a strong cleaving basis for not wanting to be part of a group that would make decisions that i'll be subjected to that i don't get any say in unless it's really important to do that like we're gonna have there's a situation where tribal warfare is starting to occur more often and so having a larger group is really important or you know some something like that in which case the bonding [6922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6922.4s)

energy exceeds the cleaving energy but let's say that we could actually have a situation where we had incentive to share to not disinform and to share accurate information with each other and that could scale beyond a dunbar size i so now we have something where we don't have fractal disinformation inside of a company we don't have people [6945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6945.44s)

competing for cancer cares that aren't sharing information with each other i think that system would out-compete all the systems that we've had in terms of innovation and in terms of resource utilization resource per capita utilization so much that if we could do such a thing it'd become the new attractive basin to which civilizations would want to flow [6967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6967.44s)

and i think the limit of dunbar dynamics were communication protocols and i think we do have technological capacity and i'm i mean both social technologies and physical technologies to develop systems and and so like this is kind of at the heart of it to develop systems where there was more incentive to share honest [6990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=6990.4s)

information and obviously this is a example of anti-rivalrous where i had my well-being and your well-being and the well-being of the commons more tightly coupled to each other yeah that's the first part of it okay so try to figure out how to get very large-scale um human collectives to behave like small scale human collectives well let's yeah if we think about two groups of people that sounds to me like trip advisor where i travel to some country i'm i've never [7033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7033.44s)

been to and i'm never going back again and there's some sort of reputational cost that a hotel would have had if it had gamed their guests so it becomes a bad idea to game your guests because you have a fractional relationship with the world in some sense where somebody has left a review that says you know be careful they try [7056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7056.639s)

to upsell you on the wi-fi and it's a scam and here's how to look out for it and suddenly you have got a problem if you're a dishonest actor because there is this sort of reputational uh game that is technologically enabled [7074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7074.0s)

yeah so i think this is why people like [[blockchain]] is the idea of an uncorruptable ledger is that um disinformation and information withholding or would be really benefit beneficial to the public and any kind of bad acting does less well with good accounting systems i have to be able to kind of corrupt the accounting in some [7092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7092.159s)

way to be able to have it be advantageous and so can we make can we make systems that make the accounting much better as part of it but it's not the whole basis because then of course you still have incentive to figure out how to game the game whatever it is as long as we still have separate [7109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7109.36s)

interest and the separate interest which is that any in-group can advantage itself at the expense of an out group or any individual can advantage itself at the expense of other individuals which is grounded all the way down to like a private balance sheet i do think is an inexorable basis of rivalry and i do think that rivalry in a world [7129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7129.36s)

of [[exponential tech]] does self-terminate and given that i don't think we can stop the progress of tech i do think we have to create fundamentally anti-rivalrous systems and i don't think you can do that with capitalism or that or private property ownership is the primary basis to how we get access [7148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7148.639s)

to things i don't think you can do it with communism or socialism or any of the other systems we've had but i don't think that if we look at how the coordination system of cells or organs inside of a body works i don't think it's capitalist or communist i think there's a much more complex way of sharing information and provisioning resources within the system you know this is how um the famous anarchist peter prince peter kropotkin got in trouble is that i think he was like kind of an amateur naturalist and he would observe things like ant colonies they'd say well look look [7183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7183.44s)

how well the ants cooperate and of course you didn't know that it was a haplodeploid system where sisters are more closely related to each other than to the offspring and you had a you know a breeding queen and then effectively mimicking some kind of body division into soma and germ where your somatic cells have no possibility [7205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7205.76s)

of leaving a permanent trace of themselves but for their ability to aid your germline cells that can become a fertilized uh you know egg and an embryo i don't think there is an adequate biomimicry example okay and i think there's an important reason why is i think that technology creation is [7228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7228.08s)

something that we don't see happen in nature anywhere else and of course animals will use a tool but they don't evolve better tools or develop better tools the way that we develop better tools and the distinction of technology creation or [[tool making]] as a process by which new stuff comes to exist as opposed to evolution as a [7249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7249.92s)

process by which new stuff comes to exist is at the heart of a lot of the things that i think about here because i think it fundamentally changes our thinking on like social darwinism and why markets are kind of a viable or inexorable idea is if we think about evolution as a process [7268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7268.639s)

by which new things come about defined by mutation survival selection and then mate selection within an environmental niche and then of course there's recursion on niche creation in in evolution we see rivalry everywhere [7288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7288.159s)

as you were mentioning in like biology there's a lot of really painful things to look at and i think we've especially since darwin modeled ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] for a long time and but i think and i think that we actually even reified the theory of markets with evolutionary biology to say that demand [7309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7309.84s)

is like a niche and that the various versions of a product or service are like mutations and the company that survives because it's able to supply the demand well those ideas and those technologies make it through and then if there's a couple that are mutually good where merging would be good so you get a merger and [7330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7330.4s)

acquisition that's kind of like mate dynamics right like recombinant work dynamics and this is why competition is good and drives innovation and same as happens in nature i think that's kind of the way that a lot of people think about markets in relationship to evolution and i think the reason we can't think about it that way [7349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7349.76s)

and it also the reason why we don't see whether it's ants or whether it's cells in a body or anything why we don't see examples of the kinds of coordination in nature that will apply to humans is i think that the development of technology both language and social coordination technologies and physical technologies but our capacity for [7371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7371.52s)

abstraction and then things that increase our power via abstraction as opposed to their power increases via some instantiated thing like a gene is a fundamentally different process because in nature you will see rivalry you'll see obviously one if if the lion catches the gazelle the [7392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7392.08s)

gazelle dies if the gazelle gets away the lion might die right and yet all lions and all gazelles are symbiotic with each other meaning if there were no lions the gazelles might eat themselves to extinction if there were no gazelles lions might starve so there's this process by which micro rivalry leads to macro symbiosis and both of them evolving supports each [7410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7410.719s)

other to evolve as the lions get a little bit faster they eat more the slower gazelles the faster ones genes recombine and you get faster gazelles yeah but how do i mean you know mathematically i think the lack of altera equations is this predator so very simple predator prey dynamics uh with like let's say two species [7430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7430.239s)

uh i understand how that can be stable right um i don't understand that in the presence of [[exponential tech]] i mean okay so the first thing that i got trying to be concrete here is that maybe something like the technology of reputation might allow us to leverage up small [7451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7451.119s)

group dynamics towards large group dynamics the idea that i don't have to know you to know something about your reputation um i see some hope there but then it's open to reputational warfare i think reputation systems will be gamed i agree right but look i [7472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7472.4s)

i'm very thinking about [[game b]] yeah not because i don't understand our need for it is that i can't imagine the system that gets us out of our nature and our nature you know rivalry abounds [7492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7492.96s)

within nature cooperation is found everywhere um i don't see a way of getting everything towards universal disclosure cooperation but i'm i hear you are one of the people who is the farthest along thinking about how we might pull this off yeah and i know i told you earlier i have to [7518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7518.239s)

apologize for a strange night that had me not sleep so operating at low capacity so i think i'm less clear than ideal but um no i want to say a little bit more because just saying make large groups work like small groups is like that doesn't help at all i want to actually say a little bit more about how we would do that but specifically why the [[tool making]] thing is such a big deal and why the biomimicry examples don't work because it specifically then plays into what does have to work the mutation pressures that are happening in nature are relatively evenly distributed across the system we think about mutation survival selection and then breeding selection and so you don't get a situation where [7560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7560.96s)

one species gets a thousand x advantage in a single quick jump independent of all the other ones right the mutation is only going to be so big and the mutation forces that are happening on the lines are also happening on the gazelles right so they're all experiencing gamma rays or oxidative stress or copying errors or whatever [7582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7582.88s)

similarly so that's one thing and then the other thing is that there's co-selective pressures as as the lion gets a little bit faster then the gazelles end up getting faster because the slower ones get eaten and the faster genes recombine and so because of the pair because of the even distribution of mutation and [7601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7601.52s)

because of the co-selective pressures there's a certain kind of symmetry of power that happens right the gazelles get away as often or more often than the lions get them and so you only get the situation where micro microrivalry leads to macro symbiosis when you ha and also the situation of metastability of an ecosystem when you have something like a [7622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7622.32s)

symmetry of power within the system a symmetry of power yeah if the lion's got a thousand times more predatory in one generation they would end up eating all the gazelles and then going to their own collapse the they get they get they increase their predate as they increase their predative capacity [7643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7643.599s)

the environment increases its capacity to respond to the predative capacity symmetrically similarly i mean this works up to a point i mean part of the problem is is that gazelles are not the only thing that dying on lions that lions dine on right and furthermore [7668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7668.639s)

you know lions are not the only even even if lions are atop some predator hierarchy one lion and 20 hyenas uh is not a rep reputation for it's not a recipe for lion happiness so you have you have very complex dynamics with um with many species interacting and that's what i mean you [7692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7692.639s)

have metastability of the whole ecosystem not stability because some species will die off and other species will emerge but you have an increase in orderly complexity but there is a parallelism between lion and lion between lion and hyena between lion and gazelle right and if there wasn't you would have you [7710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7710.719s)

wouldn't end up having metastability you'd have something have a runaway dynamic that was unchecked by the dynamics of the environment so basically the the forces the evolutionary forces that are happening are happening across the whole solar the whole system and co-affecting each other but with [[tool making]] [[tool making]] didn't occur for us [7731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7731.04s)

with a mutation [[tool making]] was us consciously understanding that this sharp rock that maybe a chimp would experientially use a sharp rock and then use another sharp rock and realize this rock was experiencing sharper but it wouldn't understand the abstract principle of sharpness to make sharper flint things our capacity for abstraction leading to [7750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7750.639s)

[[tool making]] like that made us increase our predatory capacity radically faster than the environment could become resilient to our increased predictive capacity and that was the beginning of a curve that has you know started to verticalize exponentially recently but because of that [[tool making]] we could put on clothes and go to the arctic and become the [[apex predator]] there in a way that the lion or the cheetah couldn't leave its environment we could we could go become the [[apex predator]] in every environment and over hunt the environment and then when we would over hunt environment rather than have our population come to steady state we could go move to and start overhunting another environment and then [7790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7790.56s)

figure out agriculture that's super different than every other animal and so you don't have a situation anywhere in nature where like a single lion could do that much damage to its environment but you do have a situation where a single person like a putin or a trump or whatever could do massive damage because [7807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7807.679s)

of technology to the total biosphere you don't have a situation where a single cancer cell can propagate cancer genes instantly to the whole system it's going to affect the cells around it which have a chance to then correct it there's a lot of corrective mechanism so the [[exponential tech]] increases our leverage so much [7826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7826.8s)

that if we that individuals and small groups have the capacity to influence the rest of the human space but also the biospace in a way that nothing else has so there is no example anywhere in biology of a system that can that has the kind of asymmetry relative to its whole environment that we have [7847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7847.76s)

so yeah if i understand correctly i mean the the slight adjustment i would i would give is is that orcas get you part of the way there because they're a broadly distributed [[apex predator]] they occur in southern northern seas they [7867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7867.04s)

have all sorts of different strategies the thing that that you're coupling it to which i think is very interesting is that nobody has seen a 10 000 fold increase in orca efficiency as a predator so it may be a we couldn't because as they start eating too many of the fish then they can't keep breeding no i understood that point so my my my point is that you said you [7891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7891.36s)

were trying to indicate that you could just keep changing your environment like your clothing becomes a microclimate so that you're able to become the eight the the polar bear is no longer the apric [[apex predator]] of the arctic right and you could make the argument that the orca is not the [[apex predator]] of the seas because we're in the seas and i think the example there is just [7913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7913.44s)

think of an ocean trawler with a mile-long drift net and the number of fish it pulls up compared to an orca and you realize that we can't model ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] that are competing with others to see who's maximally dominant with that much power without right this is a very interesting point and i think um the idea that we are without precedent uh many of us accept um we don't know of any other species that has language ability to coordinate the way we do all those certain social species from african dogs to orcas to what have you you know are pretty impressive in their ability to coordinate in one form or [7950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7950.159s)

another so what i hear you was saying is that tool use and the extended phenotype if you will to use richard darwin's concept like for example these microphones are part of our extended phenotype because they are tools that allow us to do something yeah um okay that changes the picture and it also ends up introducing both [7974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7974.32s)

a fundamental thing about the problem and the solution i'd recommend tell me about the solution okay and then tell me about the problem i want to have well which order would be better logically i just i would love to get to the positive uplifting part yeah so so we can say that what's particularly a primary thing that's particularly unique [7999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=7999.599s)

adaptively about homo sapiens yeah is our capacity for techne right our capacity for tool and that's social tools like language and democracy and but also physical tools and they're all abstract pattern replicators rather than instantiated pattern replicators right so memes rather than genes so you could say that what humans selected for are genetics [8022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8022.32s)

selected for mimetics our genetics selected for radical neuroplasticity and the capacity to have much more significant software upgrades that could change our capacity without needing hardware upgrades and so and i would argue that this is [8040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8040.639s)

partly why we have such a long period of neony right why we have such a long period of being totally helpless on the outside is because i'm going to give up um on trying to get you to redefine the words that are going to cause people to have to go to their dictionaries i think one of the one of the things that i've said about this this podcast [8060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8060.239s)

is that um we may misspeak we may use language improperly but we should at least play with it and invite people to look things up on their own hey i only was doing that because i listened to the half hour thing that you said that said you're going to let people go look at their dictionary yep so i'm breaking my [8077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8077.679s)

own rule you're you're playing me against me i love it all right so we have an extended period of neonate go on yeah so we're embryonic on the outside meaning we're helpless for a super long time compared to anything and obviously there are some animals like birds that are more helpless than other ones for longer periods but nothing like us but we don't if we came hardwired [8097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8097.84s)

how to be fit to our environment that wouldn't make any sense because we change our environment so fast most creatures emerged evolved to fit an environmental niche but as niche creators as significant as we are both because we moved places then you know like this is not an evolved environment and it's not that adaptive for me to throw spears but i do need to be good at [8119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8119.04s)

texting so we had to come to be able to learn language whether i'm learning english or mandarin whether i'm learning spear throwing or texting or whatever and so what i would say is that essential to [[human nature]] is the depth of nurture capacity relative to other species and so when i look at the thing we call [[human nature]] i look at how much i think the social sciences don't factor that there is ubiquitous conditioning that we're doing the social science within that is ubiquitous conditioning and there are outliers that are actually relevant that aren't just genetic all right so if i understand you correctly and now we're going to just totally geek [8158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8158.719s)

out we are the most case selective of species that is that we put the largest investment into our young um we delay reproductive maturity for 12 or 13 times around the sun seems crazy and therefore your point is we have got an unparalleled opportunity for teaching for adaptation because we unlike the wildebeest who has to be more or less ready good to go uh almost from [8186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8186.48s)

the moment of birth yeah right the idea is that we are in the luxurious position of having a long period of development and knowledge transfer because we are more about the extended phenotype i mean look at this anthill it's pretty amazing yeah so what that tells me is i look at some outliers on both sides of the bell [8208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8208.479s)

curve of various dimensions of the human condition and let's say we take buddhism for instance we have something like three millennia of 10 million fluxing give or take people who mostly don't hurt bugs across different bioregions and across different languages and that's really significant when we think about the inexorability of violence in humans and then we look at say the janjaweed or some group of child soldiers whereby the time someone's a teenager they've all hacked people apart with machetes i think that the human condition can do both of those [[human nature]] can be conditioned to do both of those but then i see that we have a system where in general the as soon as a tribe figured out as soon as a couple tribes were competing for resources it was generally easier to move than it was to war until we had moved everywhere in which case it was it started making [8270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8270.08s)

sense to war and then as soon as any tribe militarizes every other tribe has to militarize or they lose by default and the game of power has begun in in earnest in that way the human on human game and i think we've seen that the peaceful cultures largely got killed by the warring cultures and the warring [8290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8290.399s)

cultures learn from each other how to be more successful at it and so the thing that we have now is something that has emerged through iterations on power dynamics and it's conditioning everyone within it and then we do all of our social studies within that and say this is [[human nature]] well so this is a very weird place to get [8312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8312.08s)

brought back to because i'm i'm on the escape branch of our decision tree and what you're talking about is possible when you can do better by investing in peaceful and um kind alternatives i don't know what to call it exactly but non-violent alternatives and as soon as things become kind of steady state zero sum you start eyeing other people as protein sources because that's the way to grow a slice and i don't know how you get out of this in a finite world [8356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8356.319s)

so maybe the idea is that you're you have a concept of escape yeah that isn't physical escape i think malefice was right at the time but wrong fundamentally where he said resources are reproducing geometrically or humans reproducing geometrically resources arithmetically [8375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8375.84s)

so there's either not enough or there's not going to be enough certain point well he hadn't got to the point that some cultures went into negative population amounts and lower birth rates without an imposition it's not just china's you know one child in position that did that but we've seen birth rates low enough in some of the [8394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8394.64s)

nordic countries and in japan and he hadn't got to the point of seeing the phenomena that bring that about or the ability to recycle effectively and which means not a linear [[materials economy]] so i'm starting to i'm starting to guess where you're going to go so if i understand you correctly the idea is that you're going to look at all of the places we've been a little bit sloppy [8416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8416.56s)

like recycling wasn't a place that we put too much attention and increasingly as we understand that stuff is limited we we have more of a reason to be careful about our land use rare rare resources i think i get that part of it and you have another idea here about [8438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8438.96s)

development is kind of unused and we could do something far greater and then you just had another one that's slipping my brain population oh that we would start to see fertility below replacement rates so you would actually go into population decline as a means of taking pressure off of the system yeah so i see the [8463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8463.04s)

possibility for a steady state population that is within the carrying capacity of a closed loop [[materials economy]] but that is fueled by renewable energy so you basically have a finite amount of atoms so you circle the atoms you don't have a finite amount of energy because you're getting more energy every day but you have a finite [8483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8483.76s)

amount per day and so you have to be able to cycle the atoms within the energy bandwidth and you're cycling it from one bit pattern into another bit pattern right like from one form into another form and the forms are stored as bits so you have atoms energy and bits and you don't really have a limited number of the bits that you can have [8501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8501.359s)

and so we can have a economy where it's getting continuously better but not by getting bigger but by getting better we continuously make more and more interesting things with the same fundamentals we've always had the possibility of decoupling economic growth from let's say [8521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8521.12s)

burning uh fossil fuels we just haven't gotten around to doing very well okay what i'm starting to hear is that you believe potentially that maybe we should embrace declining populations as a means of either and i don't want to put words in your [8543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8543.28s)

mouth but i'm just trying to guess ahead one possibility is is that we need to uh amplify the people who can live peaceably and that maybe the idea is that people who can't live peaceably need to be incentivized to maybe have fabulous somatic lives but without reproducing i don't know so that [8565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8565.04s)

we can drive certain traits towards zero maybe the idea is we just need to take ambient pressure off the system and so we need to go into a world where 8 billion becomes 6 billion becomes 1 billion and we start dropping down again um i think we see that obviously birth rate is higher where there's poverty and we might lose some [8588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8588.64s)

kids right and so as we just get out of abject poverty birth rates go down and then as total economic quality of life and the choice possibilities for women and education and other things go up we start getting to uh much lower birth rates and no i'm not concerned that the birth rate will just [8612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8612.64s)

collapse forever it will come to some steady state birth rates but those are happening as a function of increased good things increase quality of life so in other words if you make the opportunity costs for child bearing enormous by making sure that let's say females have outrageously great career prospects [8634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8634.479s)

and it starts to become much more fulfilling and she doesn't want to spend her whole life pregnant well look i mean there's different issues with um women not realizing that most of their children will survive which is happening in the demographic transition so people miscalculated for a period of time leading to [8659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8659.12s)

fears about runaway population booms so that's that's one effect and then there's another one about if you give people education um if you give if you educate women the opportunity costs of staying home and raising children starts to impress itself and so people will have fewer [8676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8676.319s)

children yeah but i think where you're where you're headed is super interesting and part maybe it's one of the reasons that people might find it rather disturbing making life awesome for females might mean having far fewer children yeah all right so that's a a good thing in schmucktenberger's well yeah this is [8697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8697.84s)

so both i mean the malthusian trap right the malthusian situation is both the geometric production reproduction of humans and the arithmetic reproduction of resources and i think neither of those are true inexorably true i think we can keep cycling the resources and so basically we can have a steady state human population within a renewable [[materials economy]] carrying capacity but where we're keep but we keep innovating on bits so we keep making more and more positive and interesting things so we keep getting an increase in quality of life but not by increasing [8736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8736.16s)

the qual the quantity of the pie and the quantity of people consuming it but the quality of it well in the world of atoms i can't have bill gates home in washington state but in the world of bits maybe i can live there in my virtual reality and even have much more fantastic places and so i agree that bits have some ability [8758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8758.56s)

to create wild abundance that goes non-rivalrous but i've brought up a very different concern which you may be familiar with which is abundance can kill you if you have if you look out these windows and you see all of these people engaged in activities without being told to do so by a central authority what is it that ties that together for the most part markets with some amount of state control of violence in the form of policing um okay so now you create abundance an abundance has this weird effect that it turns private goods and services into [8795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8795.359s)

public goods and services where price and value are no longer equal and suddenly you have people who are producing things that are very valuable and can't get paid right and so how do we handle the takeover in this hypothetical world where we get to an economy of abundance that doesn't actually cause a collapse of civilization you can you can die from abundance though a market can die from abundance but i'm not proposing a market society i okay so i like that so the idea is that we welcome the destruction of the markets to be replaced by and it's important to say obviously if i have a situation where valuation is at least largely proportional to scarcity then i have a basis to continue to manufacture artificial scarcity and if something becomes abundant enough it loses value then of course abundance and markets don't go together i'm very excited about any credible thing that is better than markets [8862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8862.16s)

because markets well laden with problems have been pretty amazing in what they've produced yeah i'm not going to criticize the evolutionary path here to say we can argue straightforwardly why this path can't continue why the nature of it self-terminally i agree but the big problem here has always been that we [8882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8882.56s)

have so little experience with um [[self-terminating]] our rivalrous desires well so this is why you bring the buddhists up all right and i think the buddhists got past one part of the [[dunbar number]] if we think about can you think of a couple of buddhist countries for our listeners at home that they can keep in [8903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8903.28s)

mind while you're talking about buddhism um mostly they don't have countries anymore there are buddhists in a lot of southeast asian countries so there are buddhists in india there are buddhists there's a lot of buddhists in nepal obviously tibet was buddhist before tibet stopped existing in that form um [8923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8923.84s)

but and you know i could bring up jane's or others but there are so few of them that it's a little bit easier to throw it out as an outlier but basically cultures that were widely peaceful but it is important to say the widely peaceful ones did largely get either killed by warring cultures or somehow taken over by them or they [8946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8946.56s)

became warring at a certain point and this is why your escape hypothesis which your escape hypothesis only works if we can make a much better civilization but it needs to not have proximity to the thing to external sources of rivalry so that it can develop and i i want to say you know that one of the reasons i keep pushing you on these things is not because i'm trying to to do a gotcha style interview the concern let me just be open about it is that there are so few people who are thinking who are tempting to think rigorously about what we actually are and what we must become if we are to have a long-term future that i'm not i i believe that you are [8988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=8988.72s)

somebody who's trying not to flinch when it comes to a description of how we got to this place from the [[arms race]] that is read of tooth and claw called called nature and yet your point is maybe we can hack ourselves into a situation with a future where with [[exponential tech]] as you call it we don't have a future and here is the basis for rigorous idealism and hope and so that's what i'm trying to tease out no great yeah i don't think that we are inexorably rivalrous can we take this weirdly into the realm in which it is hardest to imagine that we are not [9032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9032.399s)

rivalrous which is sex as the precursor to reproduction the floor is yours sir okay this is gonna make the conversation weird no no look i think that where you're heading let me rephrase this every branch of the decision tree has gotten hyper weird and anybody who's not [9058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9058.88s)

looking at the fact that there is no non-weird branch of the decision tree is missing the story of who we are and what time it is in human history so i think to not explore the weird to not dream about what might be is the least responsible least adult thing we can do if we don't dream and we don't explore the weird [9082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9082.72s)

we're doomed yeah all right with that the floor is yours okay i wanted to go somewhere with buddhism and why not inexorably rivalrous and that then if they were to actually get the other side of the [[dunbar number]] which is not just getting care beyond the [[dunbar number]] which they could do through abstract empathy but also the ability to calculate and coordinate which they couldn't because they didn't have the tech to do it and i'm basically going to say we can get something like abs oh well okay i'll do the sex thing and the buddhism thing together because they actually go together [9122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9122.08s)

i think we get something like a certain level of empathy up to the [[dunbar number]] just through mere neuron type effects through the fact that i know these people they know me we've lived together if they're hurting i'm gonna see it because they aren't somewhere far away got it and similarly i'm less likely to pollute [9140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9140.24s)

in an area i'm in than through an industrial [[supply chain]] that pollutes somewhere that i'm not so just the proximity where the cause and effect has a feedback loop as we start to get to much larger scales where i haven't a cause and there's an effect but i don't get a feedback loop on it the broken open feedback loop is a problem so i think the buddhists were able to train abstract empathy not just empathy for the people who i see hurting but empathy for all sentient beings throughout time and space right feeling their connectedness with them that's the nature of the vows of the bodhisattva and they're not the only one right this is different religions have tried to do [9180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9180.479s)

this but it's an example of a group succeeding at it where they were able to have a sense of positive coupling of my well-being in the well-being of another rather than inverse coupling they get ahead and it's decreasing my ability to get ahead what they the other side of the [[dunbar number]] was not just who we care about but also our ability to coordinate and i [9201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9201.28s)

don't think they were able to figure out coordination mechanisms that are adequately effective at scale okay i think if we do both of those things we can make a fundamentally different kind of civilization and rivalry mostly comes down to today private balance sheets which is i can [9222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9222.64s)

get ahead economically and the money equals optionality for most of the things that i want all right and i can get ahead economically independent of you getting ahead and even at the expense of you getting ahead or the expense of the commons right and so my near-term incentive can oftentimes be a long-term disadvantage to others of the whole so [9243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9243.12s)

now this basis of where my well-being and the well-being of others or the commons the delta between those is the basis for rivalry but then dealing with that rivalry keeps increasing coordination costs keeps cr you know creating disinformation systems where we can't coordinate effectively um so how we deal with the balance sheet [9264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9264.319s)

part there's a few things right now for me to have access to stuff i have to mostly with a few exceptions possess the stuff right so possession and access are coupled and if i possess something i don't have to be using it i'm just reserving the optionality to use it the drill that sits in my garage that i might not have used in a couple years but at least it's [9287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9287.52s)

convenient that when i want it it's there right but me possessing something means that i have access to it means you don't have access to it and so with a finite amount of stuff the more stuff you possess the less stuff i have access to rival risk spaces but we all know library type examples or [9306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9306.319s)

shopping carts where if i have enough shopping carts at the grocery store for peak demand time i don't have to bring my own shopping cart which would be a pain in the ass and would require 10 000 shopping carts per grocery store rather than 300 everybody bringing them so what matters is you having access to the shopping cart doesn't decrease my [9324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9324.64s)

access and we start to see a potential for this if we think about something like an uber and then we think about self-driving uber that then has a [[blockchain]] that disintermediates it being a central company and being a commonwealth resource where those where you having access to it doesn't decrease my access so we're not [9343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9343.68s)

rivalrous anymore but then we take the next step and say if you having access to transportation then also allows you to go to the maker studio that you have access to to the science studio to the educational places to the art studios where you then have more access to be creative but the things that you create you aren't creating for you to get more [9363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9363.68s)

money and get ahead because you already have access to all the things that you want and you don't differentiate yourself by getting stuff you differentiate yourself by the things that you offer because you already have access to stuff so there's a fundamentally different motive structure then you having access to more resources [9379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9379.52s)

creates a richer commons that i have access to so now we go from rival risk not just to non-rival risk which is uncoupled but anti-rivalrous meaning you getting ahead necessarily equals me getting ahead and so when we look at getting out of the malthusian type dynamics part of it is that we can actually get out of the [9403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9403.28s)

population dynamics part of it is that we can actually get a closed loop [[materials economy]] with renewable energy that can continue to upcycle and part of it is that we can utilize our resources much more effectively and much less rivalrously where we start decoupling access from possession that'll start easily in some areas be harder in other areas but we [9423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9423.76s)

start in the areas that it happens and so we start getting more and more of a situation where i want you to have access to more things because as you're more creative then i get access to more things that are the results of your creativity so where so this is an example of removing some of the basis of rivalry associated [9443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9443.84s)

with balance sheets okay i can go to sex underneath that now if you want me to you should go where is most natural to take the conversation okay i will just try to follow along um and the problem is if you go to sex directly from where you are [9469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9469.6s)

you are describing the value let's say of prostitution which is that people do not have to make a commitment to asexual partner um many people can have the same sexual partner you start to get into all of these very [9490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9490.479s)

funny areas where status for example is a very weird commodity do i want you to have more status because somehow that will give me more status do i stop caring about status if there is exactly one parcel of land which has a unequivocally the best view [9513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9513.2s)

uh is that something that i want you to have rather than me having it yeah so let's talk about status for a moment if i'm comparing you and me in terms of who has more dollars or who's taller or who can run faster or some uh i can compare us on the same metric [9541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9541.04s)

right now and if status is number of followers on twitter then whatever kim kardashian's most interesting human being that's ever lived and so i i think we know that reductionist metrics on status are also gamified and inappropriate but if we say like m.c escher or dolly like what was more [9564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9564.64s)

brilliant art i think it's a meaningless question because they both offered something completely novel to the world and something meaningful and beautiful that neither of the other ones offered or could offer and i can't compare them because i can't metricize them and the reduction of [9584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9584.479s)

that's the thing is i can't reduce totally unique things to a fungible metric so one of the problems i think is actually fungibility and metric reduction and so if you have status associated with unique things that you offer to the world awesome [9603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9603.68s)

i'm not competing with you writ large for more status i'm going to people are going to have a relationship to me for the things that i offer and those are really the people that i want to have a relationship with me and if you're offering things to the world that people have a relationship to [9622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9622.0s)

you for and i see that the world is getting better as a result of what you're offering and i have access to more a better world as a result of it i'm totally stoked on that this is where it starts to feel not real to me i know yeah okay but let's but let's go through this so here's why it sounds not real all right [9641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9641.84s)

i think so do we have a slowing in technological progress yes and you know less so in some areas than in other areas um but do we still have exponentially growing technology in terms of both cumulative amounts associated with [9666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9666.0s)

number of people in globalization and in terms of just technologies that are still continuing to grow yes of course we do so is it 50 years or 100 years we don't know but i really like i have to think of this in a kind of a mythopoetic frame that's how it occurs to me is that as we as [9684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9684.16s)

technology is empowering our choices and we are getting something like the power of gods you have to have something like the love and the wisdom of gods to wield that or you self-destruct and so when i think about i think about the rapture story or the mayan calendar or any of those stories in a metaphoric sense as just like let's say you and i were in [9706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9706.479s)

the bronze age and we had just seen a larger war than had ever happened because there were some new better weapons and they could shoot further distance and there were deserts where there didn't used to be deserts because we had got new better axes and saws and had been able to cut down more trees and we just thought about and we said [9722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9722.16s)

we're still developing better weapons and we're developing better economic extraction tools we're using our power in ways that are constructive in a narrow sense and destructive in a larger sense but everybody is doing that this doesn't get to happen forever so this phase defined by increasing power on all sides used in [9741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9741.439s)

destructive ways constructive narrowly but destructive broadly that phase comes to an end and there's something like a hard fork where if we keep doing anything similar to that it'll come to an end cumulatively whether existential or catastrophic more likely catastrophic right not full everything ends but a lot and to be able to have that much power [9761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9761.76s)

and not use it in ways that destroy the system requires being actually good stewards of power so then the whole question for me becomes how do we make a [[social system]] like what is the the bodhisattva engineering how do we make a [[social system]] that is conditioning not just individual humans but also collectives to do good choice making omnipositive kind of choice making well i have to have a sense-making system that can factor things like externalities ahead of time better and that doesn't have things like [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] where if anybody is doing the up thing that everybody [9800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9800.08s)

has to do it and so i can start to think about what architecture such a system would have to have to be able to do [[sensemaking]] as to what externalities would be and be able to internalize them and where then i can actually confer resources to those right choice making and that we're developing humans so [9818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9818.8s)

again we think about the the education associated with some religions bringing about less violence the education associated with some cultures bringing about higher average cognitive capacity and being able to bring those together as much as i know this sounds like hippie and silly i don't actually see anything [9838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9838.399s)

other than a radical increase in our good stewardship of power that makes it i love the idea that you think that there might be something here but let me come back it with my and again i'm not trying to be negative i had an experience at some point your answer requires a warp drive [9860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9860.319s)

so we we both recognize the inexorability of this thing and then are saying okay so what is the fundamental thing i'm not making fun of you because what you're saying is insane what i'm saying is insane and the people who are saying the most common supposedly adult things are the craziest of us all [9882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9882.72s)

so i at least accept the idea that we have to be here and i want you on that branch and i want other people on other branches because we need to fan out and start exploring at least start to care but i guess what i what what this makes me think of it was a particular moment in my life where [9901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9901.68s)

uh one of my closest friends um brought his father to dinner and his father was a guy who was legendary in the film industry and one of the things he taught his son was never let the other guy get the first punch in and i thought wow first strike you teaching your child [9928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9928.479s)

to strike first nobody had ever suggested anything remotely like that in all of my upbringing i never heard anything like this and i instantly recognized it for what it was somebody was going to parasitize whatever i had been taught and say wow great eric's been taught self-restraint eric's been taught [9952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=9952.0s)

to turn the other cheek to make sure that you de-escalate a conflict and goody-goody more for me your [[multipolar trap]] right okay there's a way out of it tell me i'm dying to hear it okay so do we retrofit the system no impossible foundational axioms are all the wrong axioms can we can we make a situation in which we can raise children quite differently yes go to see kids who grew up in an amazonian tribe or you know some very different conditioning environment you'll see very different types of human behavior can we change already set adults much harder not impossible but harder um so can we could we find adults that are that would be the most likely to be fast adopters of a new system like this and capable so both kind of at the [10013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10013.2s)

cutting edge of their capacity to have abstract wide empathy and bind that to their action and you know deeply considerate about actual cause and effect dynamics factor complexity and work with other people well can we find the ones that are closest there and then train them up additionally in some systems that are developed for how to do a different process of collaboration that doesn't lead to one one way of talking about it is that when we go to command and control hierarchy systems to get beyond the [[dunbar number]] we get diminishing returns on [[collective intelligence]] as a num as a function of the number of people which creates an incentive to defect against that system even internal defection and so then we get a problem if we could get [[collective intelligence]] scaling linearly we get something radically different so we get just the number of people that are needed to be able to do something like that trained to do that and we build a [10073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10073.68s)

civilization a full stack ground-up civilization because obviously i'm talking about not private balance sheets and private property is the dominant system i'm also going to talk about not democracy because the nature of voting is inherently polarizing to populations because we make propositions where both voting for it and voting against it [10092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10092.24s)

suck for somebody for something because they're based on theory of trade-offs where we didn't even try to figure out what a good proposition for everybody would be in the first place so better systems of [[sensemaking]] and choice making which we could get to and so let's say you have a full stack [10109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10109.2s)

civilization of people who are capable and oriented to implement it and you have not only much higher quality of life for the people who are there but innovative capacity to solve certain problems the world can't currently solve well because of no disinformation in the system in better coordination well then that system can export [10128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10128.16s)

solutions that other places in the world that would normally have an enmity relationship with it actually need that they can't solve for themselves so it can create a dependence relationship rather than an enmity relationship and then they're like why the are you figuring out these pieces of tech [10146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10146.399s)

and we aren't we're like well we figured out a better [[social system]] and if you want it you're welcome to use it we're open sourcing the technology here's how here's how it works but given that the technology as a social technology is a social technology of how people share information and share resources and coordinate differently it can't be weaponized because it is kind of the [10166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10166.0s)

solvent to weaponization itself and so any other group using it is just now that kind of social architecture starting to spore or to scale and so yeah i think you get out of the [[multipolar trap]] by you don't have to win at the game of power against some external force to avoid losing at the game of power [10190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10190.56s)

so far if people didn't focus on militarizing they lost to whoever militarized um and if they didn't lose to whoever militarizes because they militarize which means their culture became a culture that supports the ideas of militarization right but if i focus on being able to have [10210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10210.08s)

whoever would militarize against me be able to offer them things that are particularly valuable that are novel to a [[collective intelligence]] that can do better innovation yeah you get out of a [[multipolar trap]] that way i want to try aggregating all the little bits uh that i'm getting from you and seeing whether i'm coming anywhere close okay [10232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10232.64s)

all right so the way i'm seeing it daniel is the following first of all you're going to point out to me that there are all sorts of interesting things that have not been really effectively scaled up so your point about buddhism and jains and what have you it might be possible to use [10251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10251.68s)

this enormous and luxurious developmental period for something radically different and that something you haven't said but i'll throw into the mix and see whether you reject it is that um man's capacity for self [10268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10268.72s)

that is somatic uh eradication through fanaticism tells you how powerful the software can be that you can teach people to die for a cause let's say and which is obviously against genetic comparatives no it's obviously against [10287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10287.84s)

individual genetic imperative but the genetics doesn't work at the level of the individual it's obviously against the somatic the assumed somatic imperatives it could actually benefit inclusive fitness i think there's a very good reason to imagine that you actually benefit your clan if your deed is known [10308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10308.64s)

so i don't want to get into that but fanaticism exists and may be fungible i think the tamils for example probably showed us uh that fanaticism can be used at a political level as long as you get access to children in sri lanka yeah okay so access to children was a key thing i [10330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10330.56s)

think so yeah right so the idea is that you in effect and i don't mean to put words in your mouth one of the lessons of human history is that the devel developmental process if not used for the traditional darwinian imperative [10349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10349.12s)

is available for other uses and it is of arbitrary power yeah now i'm going to get into the ethics of it but first i just want to get into feasibility so first of all there's an enorm i'm going to keep going back to square zero if i don't get all right first thing is you're pointing out we're not [10370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10370.08s)

on the efficient frontier we're screwing up everywhere we could be doing a lot better appreciate that next point is there are a ton of different things that we haven't really looked at pushing and we could afford to push on all of these things principle among those things is we should be using development for something radically different and studying cultures which have an intrinsically sort of non-rival risk ethos to them to see what have we already been able to do and then we can engineer on top of that atoms are different than bits atoms have a some somewhat finite feel to them bits feels effectively infinite so to the extent that we can move things from [10412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10412.56s)

atoms to bits and not be coupled to a market system where you have this problem of that abundance creates public goods and services which causes markets to fail but then something else succeeds instead that we can start to have abundance particularly where we decouple and we learn more about recycling so that finite resources are much better [10434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10434.72s)

appreciated for what they are that we can get to a point where we can start to take pleasure in each other's pleasure particularly if somebody's producing something that is extremely positive for that society i want to see jackie chan given more money to make jackie chan films um so i'm not angry about that [10453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10453.92s)

so now we're scaling up all of these things the things that haven't been noticed hacks this that the other thing i like it maybe it'll buy us some time here are the things that really disturbed me about it one you'd have to grimace i mean i i wanna i'm not grimacing i'm smiling okay one is the the what is the minimal level [10479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10479.52s)

of violence and coercion needed to bring about some of these changes so this was something that i brought up in my discussion with peter thiel and his and my sort of somewhat mutual framework really i learned something from him but i tried to put my own thing back into it is take take a beautiful dream [10500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10500.88s)

ask what the minimal level of violence and coercion needed to accomplish it add that in as part of the cost and ask yourself is it still beautiful so that's one of the questions that i would ask you um and then i get to the issue of certain things like lakefront property in the atomic world anyway are valuable and unique and it becomes problematic to imagine a world in which all of our previous experience was about competing for these things to imagine 100 percent um adherence to this new way of thinking [10546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10546.64s)

well let's go protopia not utopian let's go that there are some say protop moving in the right direction all right let's say that there are some things that are harder to make adequately abundant than other things but there's a lot of [10565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10565.359s)

low-hanging fruit that we can start moving and as we do it we'll get there's good reason to think that there is a basis to do that in more areas so in a system where when something is more scarce it is worth more then if i'm on the supply side of that i have an incentive to manufacture artificial scarcity and to definitely prevent abundance that [10587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10587.76s)

would debase the value of the thing that i have in a world where we remove the association of value and scarcity then where there are actual scarcities the goal is to engineer the scarcity out of the system and so if we're talking about limited amount of oceanfront then this is where we say well can we do seasteading and [10606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10606.8s)

create a lot of oceanfront that is really awesome where there is actually more desires it's like more people are shopping at the store then we need more shopping carts and so part of the answer is how do we actually increase the abundance but not in exponential abundance because we're talking about also steady-state population and using and a lot of shared [10623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10623.04s)

resources um and it's that coupled with psychologically healthy or more mature people that relate to these things differently both of those are necessary neither would be sufficient on their own well i like that a lot and i i do quite honestly take some hope in that i'm finding that what people are [10644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10644.56s)

now rivalrous about has changed a lot i think over the course of my life i think millennials are much more interested in what what experiences have you had recently rather than what have you bought and purchased recently in part because the economy kind of turned against them but travel got cheap right and so that that's been interesting to see [10669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10669.68s)

do you believe that we have a huge nearly universal level up in maturity and wisdom available to us through development hacking yeah and so it is both how we develop that socially which i don't think will happen uniformly i think will happen in pockets that become strange attractors that other groups want to then implement once seen because they're so clearly better at both quality of life and innovation music and how long that takes to develop widely is a while like this is a multi-generation thing okay um music i think that that would not be sufficient on its own but it's necessary better sense-making systems where we can actually solve problems without causing worse [10727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10727.76s)

problems which we're not historically good at is also necessary and this is both some evolution in our epistemics and our actual processes of collective [[sensemaking]] and with collective coordination um so yes i see level ups in both of those possible right now i'm going to ask a very difficult question [10750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10750.0s)

but we have to get to it yeah in essence i've got a riff which i don't think i've said publicly which is that the the biggest problem with discussing sexuality is is that sex sex is sexy and if you have something that's central to the world that is almost impossible [10771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10771.92s)

to talk about yeah um it's a very strange state of affairs assume that we solve all of these problems that don't have to do with status sex and reproduction according to your most optimistic scenario but we have trouble over here that there's one last little pesky [10792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10792.56s)

problem yeah does this situation work yes now i will speak to it because as you said it is central and am i wrong about it that it is central of course okay but my speaking to it is probably going to change the comment section um of this video but so be it you know what if they don't want to come along for the ride they [10817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10817.359s)

i i think that the most important thing is to just try to do this i don't mean to say this to be horrible but let's try to take some of the stupid fun out of discussing sexuality by talking about it for what it is a central system that um has to be discussed because [10837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10837.6s)

it is the engine of human behavior so your brother and i had this conversation when we met and obviously with his background evolutionary biology and primate mating and whatever um uh i was very interested in his perspective and it took a little while but for what it's worth and let me just [10859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10859.279s)

jump in one second brett were he here yeah would break the theory of selection into two pieces that would be the stuff that follows natural selection the way we expect it from darwin and then he would break it into a second piece which is the stuff that goes completely [10878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10878.8s)

counter-intuitive due to sexual selection right and that division is actually part of the standard evolutionary toolkit he does it a little bit better and a little bit differently but that division into natural and sexual selection is part of the the territory and it really matters for [10899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10899.68s)

when we think about resource scarcity because the resources that people need to deal with the first part the survival part or not that much right actually but the resources that people need to deal with the mating part is more than the other guy historically which is why the guy with the 150 foot yacht might feel bad when the 200-foot yacht well this is up [10918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10918.96s)

you're not an evolutionary theorist and i'm not but we can do our best there is a version of evolutionary theory which states that there needs to be crisis there needs to be a function for showing that you are better in order to keep [10943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10943.439s)

individuals um max you know sort of on that razor's edge of of performance and that mating opportunities means that there's always a crisis there's never enough abundance because somebody with 13 homes is more desirable than somebody with [10962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=10962.8s)

nine homes if you're just trying to figure out if there were a crisis right who would do better right so we have to overcome that because that drives a malthusian situation of no amount of resource ever brings sufficiency about right and drives a fundamental rivalry which is why you said we have to address it um so what i'm my take on this as i explored it my process with myself has been asking okay as soon as i saw that the dynamics of this world that seemed intuitive and natural to most of us as we kind of grew up in it were conditioned by it were [[self-terminating]] and i said any of the things that we think of as normal i'm willing to question deeply okay and so how do i think could i imagine a high-tech civilization that doesn't implode could i imagine a kind of enlightened planet what would life be like there all the different things conflict emotion resources and sexuality is obviously one of the big questions [11027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11027.76s)

and i think i think the book sex it wrong sex at dawn obviously gets plenty of things wrong it's trying to make a strong antithesis to the standard evolutionary history of homo sapiens thesis but i think there are some key parts to it when they look at the mosswa people or the canela people or people that did [11046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11046.96s)

not have that had a stable society that was not primarily pair bonded but had multi-male multi-female dynamics it's not to say that's how humans mostly were that doesn't matter it's to say that it's a possibility if it's within the possibility set same with buddhism i'm not saying that's how people move [11065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11065.6s)

it's sort of it doesn't have to win it just needs to establish proof of concept and then we can try to scale it up yeah it's a positive deviant analysis for proof of concept to then say can we make that actual is that a viable model for a new center and is that a possible thing to make and the fact that it didn't make it through evolution so far like evolution has a blind quality to it right where it'll make an adaptation that makes sense in the moment determined by something like warfare that is actually not that good long term or is even [[self-terminating]] long-term so the argument if it would have been a [11105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11105.04s)

good system it would have made it well the thing that has made it is continuing to up ratchet rival risk capacity and that itself is going to self-terminate meta-class hacking that somehow we've hacked ourselves into a position we can keep surviving yeah and so one one version says that we can never escape the evolutionary imperatives the other says we will [11124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11124.0s)

always we have always escaped whatever our last problem was and so we should be expected that even if there's only this sliver of hope we should exploit it to the fullest yeah and so generally this situation happens that we have a near-term incentive to pursue some advantage but where the disadvantage of that thing might happen over a much longer term and that's like one of the [11144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11144.08s)

fundamental problems right the externality might show up over hundreds or thousands of years but the benefit occurs over this year so we have to do it so we have to get over that actually if we're affecting the world in such fundamental ways over the long term we have to actually be factoring that into our [[decision making]] now that's one of the minimum requirements of a [[game b]] if it's going to exist which also means of a viable civilization at all so when it comes to status because i think status and sexuality go largely together it's not exactly one for one but there there's a strong correlation i was listening to you on a few podcasts [11184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11184.319s)

and you were talking about e-prime and talking about spinners and your kind of geometric unity and i was just loving it and i was loving even the status of like you describing theoretical physics and mathematics well which are topics that you know so much better than i do but that i'm fascinated by and educating the public about it and [11205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11205.439s)

there was no like status competition impulse in me that was like oh but wait he is being seen as smart for these things i was like wow that's awesome i hope that he gets more status doing that because it's obviously good for the world jeez i have such different intuitions about this i mean you know to be blunt about it um i didn't really talk about this stuff for ages and there was a part of me that cared about status but this was always a part in fact i really to the extent that i think that i have anything interesting and new it is a very uncomfortable feeling i mean i could show you all sorts of cool things on you know if i came up with a new lick on the guitar i would enjoy showing it to you this is something i feel very i have felt very uncomfortable about and there are ways in which [11266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11266.319s)

well it's very apart for me from the status game i i've been fascinated looking at some of the comments where people say you know so-and-so is in it for the grift and they just want money and this is an ego trip and i have to say the least fun part the reason i didn't do a podcast for a long [11289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11289.359s)

time and the reason that i um i didn't commercialize this and i left a lot of money on the table and i'm intending to commercialize this is that i was very uncomfortable with all of these issues i didn't like it and i think people imagine that their first few increments of status are fun so that getting more and more status must be awesome and i actually don't think that that's true i think it's a little bit like wow my first my first taste of heroin was pretty sweet i i should do this all the time it goes into some completely different place yeah so that is counter to the narrative that we're all seeking maximum status and in competition with each other for status well i think yeah i think that there is a that is a low resolution narrative right i think that um you know it's like it's i always make fun of the fact that um evolutionarily you're crazy for sugar and the fact that they give it away for free at starbucks you know there's some part of you that's a three year three-year-old kid just wants to eat as many packets of sugar as you possibly can it's not going to be a good [11364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11364.88s)

thing right yeah keep going sorry about that well so this is the thing i think i think it's actually true that there's a lot of status that is not really that fun this is also my experience but i think it's also true that we can feel good about rather than bad about where someone else is doing socially well well if we yeah i mean if we if we have [11387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11387.12s)

a kind of love and trust and we have an idea like you know i'm friends with andrew yang and i disagree with a bunch of his policies but i have a feeling that he is a guy who's just earnest you know i knowing knowing him socially i have the sense that it is not an ego trip for him [11406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11406.56s)

to want to steward the country it's a you know you're taking on a position that puts you in a life and death situation with the number of attempts on presidents lives let's say it's a very solemn responsibility and i think that in part we want people who we feel are grounded and by the way i'm not always grounded [11429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11429.04s)

you know so i've i i've drunk my own status you know to excess at times but it's a very tricky thing who do i want to have status who do i not want to have status do i trust i have a friend who is the nicest person in the world except when he's doing well and then he becomes very difficult to deal with [11451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11451.2s)

you know so that like there's the person who's fine on one glass of alcohol and you don't want them to have three yeah so i think status as a [[hypernormal stimuli]] where in a [[evolutionary environment]] we couldn't necessarily have more than 150 [11470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11470.239s)

people pay attention to us and now we can have a huge number of people pay attention to us and have it metro sized with likes or whatever i think it is like sugar a hypernormal stimulus that is very hard for it not to be bad for us and we actually have to have a very mature relationship to it and addiction of any kind any hypernormal stimulus that decreases normal stimulus is going to end up being that bad for us i think one of the metrics for how healthy a society is is inverse relationship to addictive dynamics that's the healthy environment conditions people that are not prone to addiction which means have actual more authenticity of choice because addiction compulsion writ large is less authenticity of choice and what's interesting is the hypernormal stimulus what porn is to sex what sugar and salt and fat concentrated in a frappuccino or a mcdonald's is to food right devoid of the actual nutrition or [11530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11530.319s)

devoid of the actual intimacy the concentration process that betray the ultimates the originally the proximate stimulus was tied to the ultimate and that's the brain keeps track of the proximates and then you can disconnect some of these like birth control disconnected sexuality from procreation right and in the same way if [11553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11553.6s)

there was a healthy status relationship of in a tribal environment where i can't really lie and people really are watching me and know me if i'm thought well if it's because i'm actually doing well by everybody and i have authentic healthy relationships as opposed to i can signal things that aren't true and not in a [11571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11571.68s)

and even get more status through negative signaling about other people and things like that and get a lot of hits from it it's that is the same kind of thing as the fast food or the porn is and so i think we have a hyponormal environment of the healthy stimulus that actually creates [11596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11596.16s)

a baseline well-being so most people i find that when they go camping with their friends and they're in nature and they're actually in real authentic human relationships they're checking their phone for dopamine hits from email or facebook less and they're also looking opening the the [11614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11614.56s)

fridge just blindly looking less often because they're actually having an authentic meaningful engaging interaction but in a world where i have a lot of isolation nuclear family home structures etc and not connected to nature and not [11633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11633.04s)

necessarily connected to meaningfulness that much that hyponormal environment creates increased susceptibility to [[hypernormal stimuli]] [[hypernormal stimuli]] happen to be good for markets because on the supply side if i want to maximize lifetime value of a customer addiction is good for lifetime value of a customer [11652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11652.239s)

um but it is very bad for society as a whole this i really like so if i understand you correctly people don't i mean this actually starts to solve a puzzle i think i heard that somebody asked matt damon whether he enjoyed being famous and he said it was [11682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11682.319s)

if i have the story right and maybe somebody else forgive me if i'm wrong he said it wasn't even fun for 15 minutes and this is the hardest thing to convey is that if you've never had any kind of status at all right that you know i think i said to tim ferriss that you only wanted to be famous to 3 000 hand chosen people [11706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11706.479s)

you want your calls returned you know you you want to be taken seriously when you have something to say you do not want to be universally known and that was the hardest decision in starting this podcast was i didn't think i had another option i mean part [11726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11726.399s)

of the point of it is to get out ideas that i worry are not institutional you know there's no institution that's embracing these ideas and i couldn't figure out am i tried for for months is there a way to do this without becoming part of the story right and because i think that privacy and an [11748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11748.64s)

individual life is so much more important and i don't believe that every time you bring something up you know it means that you you should have your life ripped open uh and and be dissected and discuss it's very unnatural i think what you're trying to tell me is that people think that they want to [11766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11766.0s)

be fabulously rich they think they want to be famous they think they want unlimited sexual access and in fact it is the first few tastes of these things that convince them that there must be no limit to how wonderful the world can be if only that can be mine and in fact there is something i mean it's sort of you know like [11786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11786.96s)

rosebud at the end of citizen k yeah those are much more like addiction than fulfillment and addiction will give me a spike and then a crash and then because of the crash i'm more craving something that will spike me because i feel really shitty and but then i get an erosion of baseline over time from the effects of that [11807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11807.279s)

and so of course the chocolate cake is going to make me feel good in the moment but as i have a mostly chocolate cake diet my life feels shittier as i average right as i do the integral under the curve it gets worse whereas the salad doesn't really give me that spike but as i get healthier my baseline of pleasure throughout not just when i'm [11825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11825.279s)

eating but all of the time goes up because i have the capacity to engage in more interesting meaningful things and my body doesn't hurt as much and whatever so i think the interesting thing is that it is actually just like a healthier relationship to or a more effective relationship to pleasure is anti-addictive [11842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11842.319s)

but i think most of these things that people think they want are [[hypernormal stimuli]] that is the dopaminergic part separated from the substance i don't know how much i believe this but i like it a lot so if i understand you correctly there is a world of pleasure i don't even want to call it pleasure i don't even know what to call [11864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11864.56s)

it maybe it's much more on fulfillment that we would give up that no let me say it differently what you're really saying is we are blind to the effect that somatic pleasure and status pleasure is crowding out fulfillment in our lives and that were we to actually understand the cost of pleasure of rivalry [11886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11886.479s)

that there is an individual reason to abandon somatic pleasure as the be all and end all how we how we grade a life i mean this is how many how many awesome trips to vegas did i did i have is that the thing that's going to matter most to me on my deathbed yeah i don't think it ever has [11910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11910.64s)

and i don't think it's ever what people would be most hopeful that they're let's give it a name because i don't think i've ever been down this particular route let's call it deathbed mindset for the moment just to play with it see if it works and if it doesn't work we'll trash it so people on their death bed become [11931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11931.6s)

focused on did i do enough for my community do my children think well of me well i think what happens is people realize that everything they got dies with them like all in the end it's lineage only and the way i touch the world continues and it's not just my biologic kids no no no no no no no no it's also the lineage of my thoughts [11954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11954.479s)

like memes along with genes and so i think when when we really start to think about this clearly we recognize that this direction is [[self-terminating]] the need to get stuff from the world that when i die it ends with me that [11972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11972.8s)

there is actually only a kind of self-transcendence and permanence in the way that i touch the world which does ripple ongoingly but there's also this thing where yeah again i feel almost a little bit shy talking about it even even more than the sex topic in some [11993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=11993.76s)

ways because uh i'm proposing that there is something like spiritual growth i think it is actually necessary for civilization to make it and so people affirming that they are these kind to themselves needy things that need stuff from the [12014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12014.72s)

world yeah that need other people's validation and attention and etc and living life that way where the more of it they get what they're still getting is a self the affirmation of that sense of self as opposed to coming from a place of wholeness and the desire and actual love for the [12032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12032.88s)

beauty of life and the desire to have their life be meaningful to life that my life ends but life of the capital l doesn't end and that life starts to be central to my awareness more than my life is and my life becomes meaningful in its coupling to life this answers the sex question it also it [12052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12052.399s)

answers all the other questions but i don't think there is a there to break through too yeah and the problem that we're having conceiving of it in your mind now again i don't think this gets us out of all the issues that i've raised but i think it's the first point at which i start to see that there's something really different about your perspective so just as a slow learner if we take the kind of girardian idea of all desire is memetic and i'm oversimplifying it but just meaning i want what other people have and then that inexorably causes conflict and then the conflict will inexorably cause violence [12090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12090.72s)

i think there is statistical truth to all three of those steps but not inexorable truth to any of them music i don't only want things that other people have i you know or that i that i learn from other people there's there there are things that are just [12112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12112.08s)

intrinsically fascinating to me or there are wanting for other people it is not wanting for myself anything in particular just actually caring about wanting for other people there are innate creative impulses where i don't actually need to see any like i have a friend who is a savant pianist brilliant pianist and he almost never will play [12131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12131.84s)

for anybody because his experience of playing is so beautiful that he doesn't want to cheapen it by having somebody else hear it and move into a performative place and it just is his own communion with music itself so i think there is desire that emerges from our connection to life not just the social layer [12154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12154.399s)

and then even if you're doing something that i'm inspired by and i want to do something like that too they don't have to create conflict i can be okay with you having something and want to share it or share in that type of phenomena yeah okay now i'm starting to you know i have a friend for example who's a fantastic guitarist [12173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12173.84s)

and i noticed that when we play together he doesn't play at his peak ability because he wants the pleasure of playing together yeah to to be that the thing that we share if i was a better guitarist it would be more fun [12194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12194.96s)

to trade things back and forth but the danger of going out of shared experience is far greater and so you know i yeah i i know the things that you are saying are true and perhaps what i've been saying back to you could be re-translated as the transcendent beyond the proximate somatic pleasures that we have is so rarely experienced [12222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12222.239s)

at scale it's not experience at scale well little bits and religions in religion it happens i think that in in families there are things that people don't want to share outside of the family because they bond the family and but it's just it's hard to imagine a world in which [12242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12242.88s)

people stop coveting their own name and lights you know people being impressed by by their car their yacht their house this that the other and i think that what you're talking about not hard for me to imagine well this is the thing i mean you know the odd thing that i have in being the friend and the employee of a [12264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12264.64s)

billionaire is that i sometimes get to borrow his life yeah and you know he's made his home available to me um music in hawaii for example and it's absolutely astounding to be in control of an asset like that i have another friend who lent me his island year after year [12283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12283.84s)

but i also found that i didn't want or need that and that both of these gentlemen that i'm referring to were much more focused on ideas than they were on faberge eggs or displaying a picasso or anything like that because ultimately they found they they wanted to go their association with me was let's talk about things that might move the needle in [12308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12308.72s)

human history rather than do you have any idea how much this bottle of wine cost and remember i was saying earlier that i think dominant paradigms co-opt psychology to define healthy psychology as supportive of the paradigm so what i'm about to say in terms of what i think healthy [12328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12328.479s)

psychology is is not the current definition of healthy psychology it is one that would be fit to a to an actually viable civilization i think psychologically healthy humans are emotionally coupled to each other so 100 so when you're happy i'm happy i'm stoked for you if you're hurting i feel [12346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12346.56s)

that i feel compassion and empathy i think the worst psychology is the inversion of sadism where i feel joy at your pain rather than enjoy your joy and pain with your pain i think it's a french expression is not sufficient that one succeed in life one's friends must also fail [12367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12367.68s)

yeah so that is a perfect statement of what is most wrong with the world right that's that that is the heart of the worst part of gay may but i think jealousy is one step away from sadism because if sadism is i feel joy at your pain jealousy is i feel pain at your joy or your success or envy right [12387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12387.92s)

and i don't think that is a psychologically healthy place for people i think it is a largely we condition this because we watch movies where we celebrate when the bad guy gets it right and we condition the out of we celebrate when the bad guy gets and we celebrate when our team wins and the other team loses so we can collectively decouple our empathy [12408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12408.0s)

from other human beings arbitrarily so that we can then feel good in a war supporting you know when that type of dynamic occurs and we get conditioned that second place is the first loser and all those types of things but this is conditioning again and conditioning of a highly neuroplastic species so i think our intuitions are [12426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12426.72s)

all bad if we haven't spent time really questioning these things and then also looking at cultural outliers because i don't think any of this is inexorable is it is it ubiquitous yes is it an exorbitant no but i think what is ubiquitous is psychopathology well daniel i think what i've gotten from our [12444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12444.56s)

conversation is is that you've got a lot of examples that are at the proof of concept level of things that are underexploited you've got an observation that we're far off the efficient frontier that there's one giant overlooked opportunity which is that we are so radically case selected that our developmental period from age 0 to 13 could be used for something radically different which i think is the the biggest hope in your whole complex of ideas together with the idea that there are realms beyond somatic pleasure that most of us spend our entire lives not knowing what it's like to break through the status and wealth and security games and effectively we have no idea what the top of maslow's hierarchy when fully realized is and that it might be possible to at least begin the game to buy us some time to try to figure out what we would do at scale now i still don't see any world in which we can defeat all these [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] but i think what you're really saying to me again always correct me if i'm wrong is that we could potentially change what winning feels like and that when we do that then this prisoner's dilemmas don't look right any longer because i no longer want [12531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12531.52s)

to be the one who defected while you cooperated so that i get off scot-free and you wind up with a 20-year jail term and we have to remove the context of the prisoner's dilemma as our model for the world right like actually change the nature of the context and because that is a fundamentally [12553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12553.84s)

inexorably rivalrous dynamic right well i just i don't think you're gonna get rid of all rivalry i just i see opportunities for decreasing it i see opportunities for changing the culture the the the weakest part of your argument to me at this moment and again i'm just learning about it is the need for universality with [12574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12574.88s)

respect to this evolution and i think that's the one part of it that i find the hardest to imagine we can actually get done so if i have a system like a corporation where my playing by the rules fully gets me ahead less than me defecting on the system internally and doing corporate politics or a back-end deal or whatever it is then i have the incentive to defect on the system and it doesn't have the [[collective intelligence]] to notice it right because there's a diminishing return on the [[collective intelligence]] of the system as a function of more scale if i could make a system and i i will claim that we can and that there are architectures that can achieve it if [12617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12617.12s)

we could make a system where the [[collective intelligence]] scaled with the number of people then i would always have more incentive to participate with it than to defect and if i did defect because i had a head injury the system would have the intelligence to be able to notice that and deal with it [12634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12634.399s)

now this is the place where i'm saying the [[dunbar number]] was both care and sense-making it was a limit on both you know our values generation and our [[sensemaking]] to inform choice making so if we want better systems of governance i.e better systems of choice making we need to get both collective values generation [12653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12653.279s)

and collective [[sensemaking]] down the conditioning gives us ways to start to work with things like very different [[value system|value systems]] but i can't have a very different [[value system]] while still incentivizing meaning a value equation economically where the whale is worth a lot dead and nothing alive right [12673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12673.6s)

and i and it doesn't have adequate [[sensemaking]] to even inform what good choice making for everyone so we can participate with the system is so that'll have to take more time well um i look forward to continuing our discussions and i want to thank you very much for coming [12694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12694.319s)

and sharing your ideas with us here on the portal and just briefly i want to say i think that i think that you're doing this is awesome i appreciate that you know there there are people who say we need divergent ideas and heterodox ideas but [12714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12714.239s)

that don't have grounded clear thinking and you know critical thinking and i think for you to bring heterodox thinkers and have but not just agree with them but have real dialectic conversation that is earnestly seeking to bring about better understanding is beautiful i was really excited about [12733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12733.76s)

that i uh i wish that i could have communicated clear having had better sleep last night but hopefully it wasn't completely unintelligible well i traveled i stand from san francisco to do this and so i think i was probably a little off my game particularly at the beginning but we can do this again and i just want to [12752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12752.56s)

say yeah those are incredibly generous and kind words i'll take them to heart i'm trying to get courage myself to do a little bit more in this space and so far i got to tell you the audience for the show has been second to none in terms of behaving uh really admirably uh and positively [12772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12772.319s)

on the internet i can't tell you how much great feedback we've gotten super constructive and uh i hope that they will they'll embrace what you've said in the same spirit so thanks daniel thank you music you've been watching the or listening to the portal with daniel schmochtenberger [12790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z3cOk1nF-w&t=12790.08s)
