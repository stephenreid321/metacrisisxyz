what's up everybody welcome to another episode of conversations with tom i am here with daniel shmack tim burger and dude you were the guy that showed up on my feed when i started researching the end of the world which is a pretty fascinating thing to become known for and i'm super curious how did you you you've touched so many different things from the neuro hacker hacker collective and self optimization and actually [25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=25.41s)

creating businesses how did you end up getting so deep into civilizations and how they fall apart what a good civilization is and how to improve things in our world i would say was my interest since i was young and kind of the center line so how to improve how young are we talking while i was very fortunate to be homeschooled growing up and homeschooled in a way that's closer [47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=47.789s)

to what people would call unschooling now or i didn't have a fixed curriculum so i got to study what i wanted and so seeing the things that seemed like the biggest problems in the world and finding out why are these things like this was actually what got to be my curriculum so very now are were you taught by your parents or did they have give you access to actual teachers my [66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=66.99s)

parents facilitated and sometimes i'd go to a public school or a private school for a while but they were very actively engaged in how i was processing the information and then other times finding tutors and other times just working with books it was before internet so i couldn't wikipedia things but we certainly use books and encyclopedias and and fortunately what was their logic [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=86.28s)

did they not like school they didn't think it was going to be a good education what was the reasoning yeah they they were kind of educational philosophers intuitively and had the sense that kids ask lots of questions they have a deep curiosity in school mostly doesn't facilitate their questions and so when the kid asks why is the sky blue and why is fire hot and [110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=110.43s)

what our emotions and whatever questions they ask they're actually very deep questions that if you want to address why is the sky blue there's atmospheric science there's understanding the wavelengths of light there's understanding the nature of our solar system and astronomy and what a sun is and then there's the neuroscience and optics and eyes and there's like a [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=128.849s)

lot that goes into it that naturally starts to unfold that helps people understand a lot of topics and also an interconnected rather than fragmented way if you follow the curiosity but most parents and also most teachers don't know how to answer those things and so then i was gonna ask how did your parents answer that like if my kids ask me and now that i have kids [148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=148.47s)

keep mind but if my kids were to ask me a question that i didn't know the answer to i'd be like yeah let's get you to public school real fast because i don't want to keep answering these questions so did one of your parents stay home yeah both of them worked to work from home as much as they could be pretty available and if they didn't know the answer then it was let's go see how to [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=169.02s)

figure that out and so that would be you know going to the library and pulling out cards to find the right book pulling up encyclopedias also something even better was them asking me why do you think it might be how do you think it might be so my answer was not instantly just defer to outside authority was to take the interest and facilitate my own thinking on it but then to not just stay [192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=192.39s)

there because the answer i come up with might be totally gibberish but to investigate so it was facilitating interest and facilitating the process of learning how to deepen the knowledge and deepen the interest as it goes and of course as you learn some things you become aware of how much other adjacent stuff that's interesting you don't know is and so if you do that and you don't [211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=211.35s)

force the kid to focus on and memorize stuff with fear of punishment that they have no interest in then you don't break their interest in life and you actually facilitate deepened interest and people tend to become good at things they really care about that yeah that is a powerful thing when i think about part of getting good is building desire and if you can capitalize on something that [232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=232.02s)

you're already on fire for and i've heard you talk about this in the perspective of how you create that next civilization you likened it to an iphone it's like you don't have to convince people to get excited about technology like it works and it brings some benefit to your life and so people just adopt things that they're really into i'm super curious oh you i think you have a [252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=252.959s)

brother right or by coincidence there is a guy on the board of one of your companies with the exact same last name is it just the two of you or they're more so what's the age difference three years younger so how did your parents handle that was he just sort of forced to come up to your level did they split it up and talking to one of you at one time and [274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=274.29s)

the other another like i said they had kind of intuitions about things that were wrong with society that related to how we developed humans and that kind of was a sense of how to do education differently how to do parenting happy family differently but it was very experimental they actually called our family guinea pig for their four of us and was an experiment and it didn't have [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=296.7s)

the benefit of studying montessori and waldorf and lots of other systems that had figured some things out so there were a lot of mistakes that could have been prevented but they were also the benefit of they were in their own kind of authentic inquiry and interest it happened that my learning style innately worked with what my parents knew how to do better than my brothers did and so he [319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=319.38s)

had a bit of a rougher go because i think they expected his path of being more similar to mine and it took a little while for them to figure out that he had a very different set of interests and learning style he ended up excelling at entrepreneurial ism and political activism and things that were not my areas of focus once you kind of figure that out do you have kids [339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=339.479s)

and don't so that would have been interesting to see like how you handle that have you given a thought to how the way that you came up and the fact that it wasn't crushed out of you could be systematized it could be something that could be rolled out about that of course so what is that in terms of the ideal school system what does that look like i think it's less to [361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=361.8s)

think about it as an ideal school system and as a civilization because by the time the kid goes to school they've already been profoundly imprinted right by the time they're 5 or 6 years old and they're going to 1st grade or kindergarten or wherever it is they start they've already fully learned the language in which they think and all of the ways that that language predisposes [382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=382.71s)

patterns of thought they've already learned that the beginning of emotional dispositions and social values and lots of things and then obviously if the educational system has to prepare kids for the workforce so we think about economics as it is then it has to do certain things that are not necessarily what would make them the healthiest happiest people if [407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=407.34s)

it's preparing them for a workforce as the workforce changes through technological automation and peak resource issues of the planet and ai automation and other things like that obviously the role of education gets completely recontextualized so instead if you were to ask how would we redesign civilization from scratch that included the thing we call education but also we [432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=432.36s)

mostly evolved in small bands and villages where we didn't just have two parents that were influencing us we had a whole crew of people that we had pretty deep connections with sub dunbar kind of connections is even the nuclear family within a very large city metropolis where you don't know hardly anyone else but have interactions with lots of people and then the mostly have [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=455.819s)

huge numbers of superficial interactions via online [[social media]] platforms like is that how what does that do to develop humans so this question of ontological design we build environments whether it's schools or [[economic system|economic systems]] in the nature of the incentive of economics right as long as my ability to as long as the forest i go and enjoy the forest gives me no economic advantage but if i [480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=480.18s)

cut it down and commoditize it it gives me a lot of economic advantage the [[economic system]] itself the [[perverse incentive]] in the [[economic system]] is conditioning [[value system|value systems]] and people and whoever does better at getting the [[value system|value systems]] that go along with the economic incentive system will end up getting more power within the system and thus continuing to evolve the system in [497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=497.879s)

the direction that benefits them and the other people do well with it so if you think about let me ask you so that i can make sense of the world view so everything that gets designed has a goal in mind so when you first started talking i thought that your punchline is going to be sort of happiness health of the individual is that accurate or is it more the perpetuation of the species is [520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=520.89s)

your if you had to say a highest value would it be that a happy and healthy populace that you know like imagine the the movie was a children of men where there are no more kids and so population is basically the world's just ending because they're not able to procreate anymore but imagine that but it was like everybody was having a great time right until the moment they died or a [546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=546.449s)

civilization where people are not exactly loving life but we find a way to get in balance with resources and we're able to go on and on and on which of those to you is better i think you set it up to make it obvious that those are both gibberish desires that a civilization that is in an enduring hell like well i won't go that far i'm really trying to find the perfect way to ask a [573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=573.48s)

question where i can find out if it's more meaningful to you to find a way to continue on and so because i'm looking for what to optimize for and you can optimize for continuation you can optimize for happiness you obviously i would assume want to do both but i'm trying to i find it it is very edifying when you force people to force rank things so that you can't have sort of [597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=597.029s)

two number ones because i i now have spent enough time in your world and sort of where you go i know sort of the the ending points of some of the arguments but i'm super curious as to what is the the big driver for you in terms of how you think about waking up in the morning and constructing a civilization optimization theory itself is one of the underlying problems this is actually [622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=622.05s)

super important to indulge me a moment here yeah if we do the thing you call stack ranking which is an idea that comes from computer science if i think about computers and i'm stack ranking trying to optimize things in a software system that software system is a complicated system as opposed to a [[complex system]] and i'm going to define those formally the difference the [643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=643.019s)

software and the hardware runs on didn't self organize right we didn't get spontaneous self-organization of hydrocarbons into proto cells themselves we got somebody did the lithography to make the computer chips and there's a blueprint for the hardware and a blueprint for the software in a complicated system you'll notice like this computer and the software doesn't [665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=665.79s)

repair it so if it gets harmed it doesn't self evolved and the phase space of all the things that can do are fully explicated and it has formal causation if i hit this key this will happen necessary and sufficient causation in [[complex system|complex systems]] like biology there isn't a blueprint the genome isn't blueprints it's a [[generator function]] to code new proteins under new environments where you can have it do things that it's never done before if you expose it to a novel pathogen or a novel environment right so a [[generator function]] and a blueprint aren't the same thing the in a in a [[complex system]] also it does self heal and self repair it does also self evolve it's a it's different in type so optimization theory from complicated systems the metaphor [708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=708.5s)

where we thought our mind was a clock when we figured out clocks before that native americans might have thought of the mind as an ecosystem right but then we got a clock now known the mind is a computer so we pick whatever the metaphor that we're operating with this but where the metaphor is wrong it really  __  stuff up and so it can give you some very partial insights and also [726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=726.079s)

some really dreadful differences so the definition of a [[complex system]] is that it has some [[emergent property|emergent properties]] beyond what any complicated model of it assumes that the complicated model doesn't show so basically if i take a cell and i try to model it right so i try to make a software program for how that cell works the cell will do some things that that model doesn't do and as i keep making [748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=748.25s)

the model better it'll keep doing some things that the model doesn't do that's what we call an [[emergent property]] right so what that means is if i make a model because the my model of reality isn't reality that's the first verse of the daodejing right the dao that is speakable is not the eternal doubt my model of the thing isn't the actual thing so if i think the [769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=769.279s)

model is the thing and then i try to optimize for the model where the model and the thing are different i actually destroy the real thing can you put that into real-world example i make a economic calculus i make an [[economic system]] for humans or these rational self-serving agents and they follow specific supply and demand economic models and laws i can get more advanced [793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=793.189s)

things to be able to look at the laws of how they'll do with things like derivative at blacks goals whatever but they're basically simple mathematical laws and say here's how we optimize maximum productivity and generativity for everyone and they don't work right like they kind of work and then they also lead to environmental destruction which wasn't part of the metric set so [810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=810.87s)

that this is where i'm why i'm trying to get you to stack rank things which is interesting that for you that's where it breaks down for me to understand what you mean when you say it doesn't work i have to understand what you're trying to optimize for so once i understand because i in the beginning when i first started diving into you i thought okay this is about optimizing for what all [832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=832.14s)

sort of round to human well-being but i think there's an important caveat in there which to you it is sort of beyond critical and and i think the whole meaning and purpose for you is that as long as it is not a hell that continuation is is a critical thing that you that is sort of behind every word that you say but i'm not sure i'm interpreting that right [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=857.88s)

okay so let's say that we're maximizing for subjective happiness decoupled from objective measures and so we're going to find some types of states that we can subjectively report on it well then the matrix might actually be the best way to optimize for it right disconnect from any kind of object of reality outside of brain stimulus and just brains to make the  __  out of the [877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=877.8s)

dopamine urge ik response and say great we optimized for human happiness and i don't think anyone actually thinks that's a maximally meaningful world or if we say maximize for the happiness at the individual level well some individuals might be sadists and really get off on hurting lots of other things if we say maximize for continuance a continuance that is really shitty it's [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=901.08s)

like why what is meaningful about life that you would want to have continued so what you're what i hear that you're trying to ask is what is fundamentally meaningful what is if we cannot i won't use the word optimize but if we can act in ways that benefit different things we can say optimize but what you can end up saying is that it's not optimizing a single metric let me let me actually [924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=924.6s)

make that clear let's say that i value the life of rhinos and i don't want them to go extinct and then also value the life of coral and they don't want it to go extinct but i also value kids that i don't want to starve in the third world and i also value subjective happiness of poets now how many dead rhinos are worth how much dead coral are worth how many dead kids are [949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=949.91s)

worth how much lack of happiness are worth how many tons of co2 how do i commensurate those metrics to then be able to say what my optimization algorithm is going to optimize for i have to do some kind of waiting and then i say well but in the context where the rhinos get below a certain number they're worth more but then when they get above a certain number they get oh [970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=970.49s)

but then i didn't even account for all the things these soil microbes without which everything dies and i didn't even account for them and this isn't now i gotta bring soil microbes into it and then i didn't account for the fact that subjective reporting will have these biases or miss these things or orient towards addiction so whatever my optimization said is there will be [986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=986.839s)

things that are matter that are outside of it that i have to continuously bring in so the optimization is for the evolutionary integrity of the whole or wholeness itself which is different than how we think of theory of optimization so do we care about people's [[subjective experience]] yes you also care about objective metrics of the quality of their life like longevity and physical [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1011.95s)

health and things like that yes also care about that do they correlate one-for-one no there are some very happy people who are crippled then there are some very physically able people who are miserable there are some people who are happy who make other people miserable and so and do we care about just individual quality of life or also the relationships what about happiness [1031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1031.54s)

versus evolutionary rate what if we could be happy but stagnate versus evolve quite quickly but never enjoy the things we were evolving to and we all have this in our own life right like if do i want to be bettering myself but in a way where i'm bettering myself because of the driver that i'm a piece of  __  who's never enough so i always have to get better but i never actually enjoy [1049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1049.69s)

any of it or do i accept myself in a way that makes me complacent well obviously it's neither of those i want to enjoy what it is fully and have my love of life have me want to keep growing not because of a dysfunctional driver right so i'm optimizing for if anything the product of the dialect of my experience of life now and my ability to experience life more deeply [1070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1070.389s)

into the future now if i take both sides i say i want to in i want to be able to enjoy the beauty of life as fully as i can now i also want to be able to add to the beauty of life for other people i also want to deepen my capacity to experience the beauty of life and add to it being doing and becoming and then you say how do we optimize for a virtuous cycle between [1093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1093.639s)

the modes of being doing becoming individually and collectively now we start to get in the right direction so basically this  __  is complicated so when i think about so you i don't know how much you think of yourself is being tied to [[game b]] but certainly your name comes up a lot with this whole idea of [[game b]] it'd be great if you can quickly sort of break down what game a is what [1118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1118.57s)

[[game b]] is and then what i find interesting is okay ken what one it do we believe it to be conceivable that we can actually construct realistically [[game b]] by putting systems or whatever it is that's going to be in place there but first i think people have to understand what it is and then we can go down the road of that conversation so if you don't mind really fast [1141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1141.609s)

what's game a what's gonna be the term [[game b]] was coined by jordan hall and the weinsteins and jim rut and a number of other people that were brought together at santa fe institute back in the day to think about a new civilization that had fundamentally new and better characteristics and so in contra distinction to the idea that this thing which is obviously the us civilization [1166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1166.72s)

today and a hundred years ago in the u.s. versus chinese civilization are different but they're all part of a meta system that has certain system dispositions like environmental disruptions happening across the whole thing wealth inequalities happening across the whole thing so game a is basically the idea of [[game theory]] which is individual people individual [1184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1184.509s)

corporations individual races nations whatever competing against each other in ways that mmm maximize their benefit as much as they can even if it harms or externalizes harm to other players or the commons so roughly game a is a civilization that emerges dominated by [[game theory]] game which is basically what we're living in right and [1206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1206.049s)

there was a recognition and i wasn't part of that crew i made friends with them after they actually disbanded that thing and then it kind of recycled and i was working on similar things in a different context so [[game b]] is the idea what would the game be what would the kind of game dynamics or how people show up in play of a game that doesn't orient toward self-determination so we'd have [1229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1229.09s)

to unpack a bit why we would say game a does intrinsically self-terminate what are the properties about it to say what would categorical solutions to those look like yeah so i don't know i'll answer the question at least as i understand it basically of a world with finite resources where you are incentivized so whaling is a great example i've heard you use before if you [1250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1250.75s)

capture that whale then you can sell it you can monetize it if you it has basically value to take it out of the ocean as zero value in the ocean and even if you were to say no no i want to live in the world where the whale stays in the ocean there's somebody else who goes how all right  __  i'm gonna go get the whale then so now it's like you're gonna lose the whale anyway [1269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1269.08s)

so you might as well be the one that takes it and in a world of infinite resources you could actually get away with that but in the world of finite resources as you say it it ends itself eventually so you will run out of resources specifically because it's not that me seing the whale in the ocean doesn't provide any value to me that i call value i might feel a sense of all [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1287.559s)

seeing it right i might feel a sense of interconnectedness or beauty or whatever it is but that doesn't increase my games here at a capacity to do anything i can't extract and exchange that value that experiencial value but if i kill the whale and i sell it as meat and i get that money that i can then go buy weapons or building materials or employ people with that actually increases my [1308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1308.649s)

power so there are kinds of value that are extractable and exchangeable extractable accumulated will exchangeable that increased power and there are types of value that are appreciated but don't increase power so those who orient to the power increasing value end up getting more power and then dominating the system dynamics so then that creates a race to do that thing [1328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1328.21s)

because like you said if i don't kill the whale i i'm not protecting the whale because somebody else is gonna kill the whale now those guys might actually be my enemies and use that increased economic ability because they're gonna feed more people their population is going to grow and then they're gonna come kill us on war so actually for my own security not only [1345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1345.64s)

do i have to now kill the whale i have to race to get them faster than that guy because now we're in a growth race which also means i'm gonna advance whaling technologies to be able to take way more than i need grow my population base start exporting to other population bases so that i can get the optionality of money to build other kinds of things with and so what we end up giving is [1365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1365.74s)

being able to see the industrialized fishing mechanisms that we have operating today that can fish more fish in a single net than maybe all of human history could in a year you know at previous points of human history and it's like the that kind of [[arms race]] multiplied by the ability to keep increasing the tech and when everybody increases the tech whether it's military [1390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1390.52s)

tech you build an ai weapon i have to build ai weapons encounter ai weapons or i lose by default and then i have to try to get an advantage on you because you probably have some advantage you're trying to get the secret to have to spy on you i have to lie to your spies and hide the stuff and i have to try to keep advancing it but when you're advancing your weaponry and so in mind i'm [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1410.17s)

advancing relative to you you're advancing on the base of what exists you get a compounding curve which is an [[exponential curve]] and we've only recently started to get to the vertical icing part of that curve started to go steep with the [[industrial revolution]] and then it started to go very steep with the information kind of revolution so we're just in a phase of what has really [1427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1427.06s)

been a process that started since stone tools it was just a very slow curve and the stone tools thing for a long time and now it is in the quickly vertical izing so the thing is when you look in nature you see well animals compete they don't increase their competitive capacity rapidly or irrespective of each other right the tiger can't just become way better at hunting it has a pretty [1448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1448.3s)

fixed killing capacity and it can only get better through natural selection which is a pretty slow process but the key is that it's a slow process that is evenly distributed across the whole forest because the things that lead to gene mutation and the tiger also leads to gene mutation in the deer the slightly faster tiger that eats the slightly slower deers makes the better [1469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1469.179s)

jeans the faster jeans and the deers in breed together and so everything steps up together very slowly in the whole environment does what happened with stone tools as humans were able to increase our per day dove capacity way faster than the environment could increase its resilience to it and so we could start extinct ting species and devastating whole environments turning [1487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1487.9s)

them to desert and moving on that was the beginning of something very different so when we think of social darwinism where we try to model ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] we're just not  __  [[apex predator|apex predators]] [[apex predator]] theory doesn't apply because in orca can kill a tuna at a time and it misses my time we can pull up a hundred thousand of them in a fishing that at once and so [1507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1507.49s)

since the orca can't destroy it whole ecosystems and we can if we keep modeling ourselves with [[apex predator]] theory and having to exponentially increase or destructive capacity exponential destruction whether in the form of extraction pollution or military destruction or disinformation and you start getting into the space of being able to win through information warfare [1529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1529.0s)

ends up destroying the commons so one thing i want to i want to put a fine point on that you just said that i've heard you say this before and i've missed until just now is what's causing that ever escalation is because you're doing that in concert with people who are essentially your enemies so like with ai it it almost certainly will be a winner-take-all game [1547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1547.9s)

because if somebody can beat you by a month and for a computer that's like a hundred years worth of learning you can see how just being the first is there gonna be the victor and so now you've got the sort of ever escalating desire to either protect yourself or to monetize and thusly the tragedy of the commons so this is part of the reason that i was trying to figure out sort of [1572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1572.59s)

what you value most because for me everything comes down to if you want if you want to build a business i will speak in those terms which i understand very well you have to have a goal you have to know what you're trying to accomplish and the clear the goal the more likely you are to hit it and if you don't have a clear goal then you're just sort of steering by a vague sense of [1592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1592.72s)

what you want to accomplish and it's going to become very difficult but there are what i call the physics of being human and the what i'm obsessed with this humans are a certain kind of way their you're having a biological experience your brain is a certain way it processes data in a certain way and whatever you do has to align with the reality of what humans [1609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1609.88s)

are like and so going to [[game b]] and thinking about constructing that and building something it's like when you were describing how interconnected everything is how complicated it is it really gives me pause about like thinking about jesus man to really do something it is going to be it's going to be really  __  difficult and when i when i go back through and look at the [1634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1634.0s)

people that were a part of the game a [[game b]] conversation it's like i'll be very interested to see if ideas keep coming out and they're iterative and we find a way to actually migrate to an entirely new approach i mean it would be a new financial system it would be new architecture at every conceivable level of society and my first question is what are we aiming at like what what is it [1659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1659.38s)

that we're i want to say optimize but i know that that trips something that i don't fully understand yet but what are we steering towards i can give you a very concrete set of examples it will make this make more sense let's take cove it and say when we're the cdc or the white house or the whu-oh or whatever institutions are trying to respond competently to it what should [1688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1688.48s)

our goal be what are we trying to optimize for well let's say we pick the goal of optimizing for the least deaths from kovat okay so we will definitely institute quarantines and contact tracing and a bunch of things it will decrease total transmission well there's a chunk of that that we did that led to the breakdown of the [[supply chain|supply chains]] for food and we're still in the middle of [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1713.68s)

that rolling catastrophe and the new cycle has moved on to other parts of the role in catastrophe so we weren't paying attention to it but when we wanted to stop travel because the virus can travel with stuff right well that meant that we stopped the the shipment of pesticides to areas that complete depending upon pesticides there agriculture so northern africa and parts [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1735.22s)

of the middle east got covered when the worst locusts in recent history because they didn't have pesticides and they lost a huge amount of crop we stopped the flow of fertilizer to places in india and other areas that make the [[food supply]] for hundreds of millions of people and they lost crops we also stopped the ability to ship food from where they were to where they need to [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1755.799s)

get so huge amounts of them just rotted we were actually culling animals right killing thousands of pigs in millions of chickens and whatever when people are going hungry in other parts of the world because we couldn't send them to mcdonald's if people are going to mcdonald's we didn't know how to [[supply chain]] route them on the other side and so we just were dealing with no change [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1773.98s)

in demand no change in supply and a complete break of the food system right now we damaged the food system in a way that pertains to about two billion people kogan could have never killed that many people so if we're optimizing for don't let like the least people die from kovat we can destroy the world or we mmm so that's the example of what i'd call a [1801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1801.789s)

second-order effect right the it wasn't the or an unintended consequence or an externality the the solution that we implemented to a narrowly defined problem or optimization goal caused a worse problem so when we define our goals in very narrow ways like make maximum amount of money from the thing i can do the wailing and destroy the ocean right if but is that way you hear me [1823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1823.6s)

saying because i'm not i'm not saying it needs to be narrowly defined i'm saying what is like what is that as as somebody who is really  __  thoughtful about this topic how do you think about those second-order consequences third-order consequences like that crazy biome of interconnected things now now that how do we think about the interconnectedness how do we think about not one thing that [1849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1849.7s)

matters but all the things and the relationships between them and then think about how to make not just individual choices but whole complexes of choices that benefit all those things and the relationships is how we start to think about it properly and it's a much higher level of complexity of thinking so when i think about co vid goal think okay well we want to minimize the total [1872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1872.679s)

number of kovat related to us all right but there are people who can die and recut i mean there are people who can get it and not die but have permanent disabilities in terms of damage to heart or lung or kidneys or whatever we'd also like to do something with that preventing icu overwhelm was actually a really critical goal before prevent total number of deaths because the death [1899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1899.62s)

spike would go up radically so you have to think about upstream ones wells downstream ones but then we start to think about okay let's make sure that in doing that we don't damage other things significantly so when people are on quarantine how much does domestic violence go up what happens to addiction patterns for kids who don't have school and just have six months of solid screen [1920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1920.2s)

time what happens to an economy where we you have 40 million jobs that go that are lost now we see a lot of violence we always see more violence whether it was systemic racism as the trigger or other triggers when we always need more violence when people are out of work yeah right so i'm being met by a system they don't stay complacent with the system that's failing them so if you [1943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1943.69s)

think of this as like four or five dimensional chess like where where is the human animals capacity to deal with this like are we actually going to be able to get people to think in that many ways we're already failing to do it with kovat do you think that that is when i go back to the physics of being human i begin my hypothesis is i'm not sure i'm not sure that we'll be able to i take i [1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1969.22s)

take a very optimistic view of most things but on that one whew building a brand new civilization without people first having to suffer a level of in tolerability seems tough seems tough to get them to believe the things that they would have to do to leave the whale in the ocean or whatever you know example we're going to use do you have thoughts around how we give a [1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=1992.62s)

simple enough narrative that people can latch on and understand okay cool i get what we have to do here for the most part we aren't even trying to think about second or third order effects currently like it's not even a thing we try to do do you think nobody's thinking about it or the people aren't listening cuz it's not sexy like when i think about what's going on right now [2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2020.43s)

so with everything that was shaking down with the death of george floyd and how everything sparked off that i started like really looking into i didn't want to just say some  __  to say  __  like i wanted to actually understand like really truly what's going on so i end up seeing this discussion about the difference between martin luther king jr. and malcolm x and [2041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2041.19s)

now martin luther king jr. had a meta-narrative which was religion it was about unity but he was measured and i mean he was very passionate obviously when he spoke but it was like this sort of calming soothing thing about bringing people together whereas malcolm x was black power there was energy there was aggression it was tapping into that anger that was right there below the [2061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2061.05s)

surface there was nothing counterintuitive about it and so he was able to really get people motivated and rallied and i thought that's interesting like when you think about human animus there's something that pisses you off and it gives you the energy i mean literally the world was burning last week and you gave people just a little bit of a justification to tap into that [2082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2082.26s)

there is something about tapping into that aggression that level of animation there's an intoxication to rage and when you can even just nudge people a little bit into that you get that so my thing is i hear people talking you're talking about this crazy eloquently but is it giving people that sexy level of animation to to get visceral to tap into something that's aggressive and that [2111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2111.03s)

feels so powerful i think about the house that i'm in right now it probably took about a year to build and i could take it down with a wrecker ball in minutes or fire it takes 20 plus years to grow an adult human kill them in a second it's easier to break  __  and the motivational complexes that break  __  and motivational complexes [2136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2136.95s)

that figure out how to build complex things aren't the same so yes there's power and can you give me a little bit about what the motivations are you've talked very well about human motivations status seeking like earlier when you mentioned power i almost stopped you because i wanted you to actually define what is power why do we give a  __  i think it would help people it would help [2159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2159.57s)

me i want to understand what is the difference specifically in those motivation types i can't stay enraged for all that long in a certain amount of time i can say in rage long enough to break this house but i couldn't stay enraged long enough for that to be the motivation to build it i was  __  yeah and the rage wouldn't be the right frame of mind for me to [2189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2189.05s)

learn the structural engineering to make the blueprints or to try to have evolved metallurgy to be able to make bigger buildings that had better trusses that requires a very different frame of mind that is doing planning over a longer period of time and for the most part the limbic process you're describing in the prefrontal process i'm describing are inversely proportional in the brain the [2211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2211.53s)

degree to which you're in one is the degree to which were mostly not accessing the other and so what kind of motives are useful for what kind of goals as an important question and to the degree that we want to build things that have complexity long term we have to be able to access the places of our mind and capabilities that can think long term and complexly can we nudge [2237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2237.0s)

people in a direction okay that's actually a great question that i want to take in a slightly different place can we merge people in a direction is a very interesting question which is so who is the we that would be doing the nudging and who is the people that some we is saying we want to influence them we want to we want them to think and feel [2267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2267.42s)

differently and change their behaviors for some goals we have that they may not have how can we change their goals and change their behavior and manipulate their emotions do you want me to answer that question sure so that this is exactly what i have given my life to which is i for a long time i tried to help my mother change and my mother smoked my entire life [2295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2295.5s)

morbidly obese she's amazing and i want her to live as long as humanly possible and i as i say you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink and then people say focus on making them thirsty and i'm like oh my god it's all amazing yes i just need to make my mom thirsty this is gonna be amazing make her want change and i realized i can't and now it may be that i just suck and [2313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2313.5s)

i'm not able to find that thing in her so it got me obsessed so i people that are that have followed me will have heard this many times forgive me but i really i had at my last company had a thousand employees a group hard as hell in the inner cities like  __  crazy  __  and shot my sister shot in the heart with an ak-47 in my front yard i held my stepfather while he bled to death from a [2339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2339.299s)

gunshot wound to the head another kid hid under a car while his best friend had to hold his intestines in from a point-blank range shotgun blast i mean it's just story after story after story is insane so i started thinking okay how do i help them make change some people you can just tell them think like this act like this they do it it's radically transformative it opens up avenues of [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2357.15s)

learning and growth and it's amazing but i'll say that's about 2% of people at least with my skill level 98% do not they hear the information they may even get excited about it might be spiritual entertainment but they don't do anything and so over the course of a month like i remember so many of them would show up to a book club not put on by me put on by other people they would get amped up [2377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2377.46s)

but then they wouldn't read the books they'd stop showing up so it was just like it it's just so short-lived so i started asking myself the question no  __  what would it take to give somebody a growth mindset even if they were antagonistic to a growth mindset and i thought okay if i can solve for that which by the way i have not but if i can solve for that somebody who [2397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2397.92s)

doesn't want to change not only doesn't they're not apathetic they're actively opposed to changing if i can find the magic sequence of things of words of whatever to get that person to be like oh my god like i can actually do something i can learn i can express myself whatever but now i'm moving in a positive direction where before i was moving in a negative direction so it it [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2419.97s)

is i have come to the conclusion with my desires and skillset the storytelling is a way to do that so i think a lot about nudging people like how much can you shift the pop culture narrative in a non sinister way but to have a kid so the more i looked into it the more i realized yo i need to hit kids at the age of imprinting i'm not talented enough to do this with adults that are [2444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2444.18s)

truly antagonistic but if i can actually get somebody who is at that stage where they're a sponge they're drinking things in and i can introduce them to characters ideas thoughts the way that yoda led me to the daodejing which i've heard you talk a lot about i became obsessed i self-identified as a taoist but all because of yoda so it was like when i read the first page of the [2463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2463.44s)

daodejing i was like oh my god this is yoda so it was like i was so instantly connected to it so that has given me that obsession to be like maybe you really can nudge people like maybe you really can plant these ideas at the right time and things from there will blossom i don't know if i'm high on my own supply or if that's actually real but it gives me so much hope that that's [2488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2488.22s)

why i'm keen so i am the this sort of we of like i'm well intended but maybe there's a second or third order consequence and i'm about to  __  everybody up i am very open to that but well-intentioned the goal is to give and what i think of as an even playing field i'm a game a person i'm super open i want somebody to show me there's a better way but i'm i'm sort of locked in [2513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2513.869s)

game aches i don't know any better i'm i'm again happy to admit that that's just part of an evolution and i'm stuck there but i'm i'm at game aid trying to find a way to get more people to play game a well in a way that is supportive and uplifting to other people but that is the wii and the people that are antagonistic are the day that i'm trying to nudge in a positive [2534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2534.0s)

direction through a story you think the chinese communist party wants to nudge the worldview of people in the us in particular directions yes through influencing media and what happens [[social media]] yes do you think russia does yes iran turkey north korea do you think they'll winning them there i would assume study project mockingbird which was when the cia started [2564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2564.45s)

influencing hollywood was when hollywood started become a very powerful force in psycho  __  we need to make sure these memes do the right things and predispose particularly when the counterculture movement started to take off and there were parts of it they were dangerous to us interest because people protesting against vietnam and some of those ideas needed to be shifted mm-hmm so how do we [2580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2580.56s)

use emotionally compelling things that use narrative because our evolutionary biology works with story well to be able to control humans for the purposes that we care about is a very ancient story we just have much better tools to do it now and i would say the [[narrative warfare]] the war between controlling what people get emotionally riled up about so that they serve an agenda whoever it is [2611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2611.82s)

that's creating the [[narrative warfare]] and they don't even realize it and think it's their own agenda because they're being nudged [[narrative warfare]] and mimetic warfare and info warfare is the brunt of the unconventional warfare happening in the world i would say that it's fair to say that today and this is easier for people to hear today than it would have been three months ago [2632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2632.04s)

because cities are on fire in the places where we didn't expect cities to be on fire and because the upcoming election in the us currently stands that no matter who gets elected a solid third of the population will think it was stolen the democrats are stacked up with that by the way it's dealing in and the trump supporters are set up to think the dems are trying to steal it so whether anyone [2658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2658.23s)

steals it or not a third of the population will think it was doing so what the  __  happens from that so either you get massive if you don't get massive violence those who want to stay elections now know fully that they can with no repercussions and how do we actually create the confidence both in the integrity of the elections and everyone [2678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2678.01s)

knowing it when the information landscape is as fractured and the narrative landscape is as fractured as it is okay so what i would say is that we are in world war 3 currently that's a bold statement it's not a kinetic war meaning bullets it's an unconventional war have go go read the doctrines on unrestricted warfare that chinese communist party and pla published or [2703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2703.66s)

unconventional warfare the u.s. published 99% of war isn't kinetic it's economic warfare its narrative and info warfare its cyber warfare its political and diplomatic and [[supply chain]] and trade warfare and kinetic is kind of the last part that will back it up kinetic used to be a bigger percentage of the story than it is now because we didn't have powerful cyberattacks and we [2727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2727.75s)

couldn't do [[narrative warfare]] as powerful as we can now because [[social media]] is just  __  amazing for being able to control minds detour on that [[social media]] will control minds and move people into war even with no-one wanting it to exist okay so if you haven't had tristan harris on the show or discussed with him the issues around facebook algorithms [2754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2754.6s)

and twitter and tick tock is even worse you should but i'll do the very brief version here you go on facebook the total amount of info published on facebook no one could ever possibly look at so your newsfeed you can scroll for a long time and not see it all and it represents almost no percentage of what's on facebook so when you see facebook and when i see facebook [2774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2774.25s)

we think we're seeing the world we're not seeing the world we're seeing a very carefully curated ai algorithm curated world now facebook wants to expose you upfront to enough of the things to see your likes and see your hover patterns of your mouse because once your mouse is hovered nothing once you've liked a couple hundred things it can predict what you will like better than your [2792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2792.07s)

spouse can and it's important to understand that the kind of ai is that are optimizing the social algorithms are better than the ai is that beat garry kasparov at chess yeah that's nuts and he's so much better at chess than you are at it had anything control in mind right and he knew he was at war when you don't even know when you're going on facebook that it's not just a [2814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2814.869s)

tool that you're using it's an agent that wants to control you that's using you and so what happens is its desire is to maximize the knowledge about you that it can sell to marketers and to maximize your time on site that it can sell as attention to marketers so you will spend more time on site when your limbic system gets hijacked than when your prefrontal cortex that remembers your [2841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2841.119s)

goals and you don't want to spend a much  __  time on facebook stays engaged so this stuff that scares you and enrages you and elicits your greed and your horniness will make you spend more time on site then the things that make you think complexly about stuff and so what ends up happening is people whatever it is that would emotionally get them which appeals to their current [2863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2863.079s)

biases is what they get more of and they get driven in more extreme directions in all directions so the right gets more right the left gets more left and you get both and tifa's and boogaloos coming out of it as the without any political goal at all really fast i've heard people say boogaloo i don't know what it means a particular alright group that identify as acceleration is that warrant [2885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2885.369s)

civil war in the us they believe they're ready that they'll win that it's eminent until they want to accelerate the movement toward civil war to get on with rebuilding the country why they called boogaloos long story there's a bunch of names boogaloos hawaiian shirts started as big igloo boys but memes coming out of fortune okay but they go from porch into facebook now so it's important to [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2907.63s)

understand that this algorithm that's happening on facebook it's also happening on twitter and instagram and tik-tok and youtube why'd you say that tik-tok is the worst as the [[social media]] platforms evolve they are evolving to be able to appeal to younger audiences more effectively in competing against the other one so whatever is the addictive that gets them to engage the [2934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2934.45s)

most is what it gets optimized for on the supply side right if i have an mba and i'm running a company i know that i want to maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer i also want to maximize the total number of customers so multiple the number of customers multiplied by lifetime revenue is my desire so on the supply side there's nothing that would be better for me than addiction of my [2955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2955.21s)

customers to my product and then being able to make the widest population adicted possible right and this doesn't just happen with [[social media]] this happened with fast food fast food is extract the most addictive things from food from an evolutionary perspective salt fat sugar mix them together in the right combinations and the palatability remove all the nutrients so that it [2974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2974.56s)

doesn't even fill you up so you keep eating it and you you have what's called a [[hypernormal stimuli]] right you get a bigger dopamine hit from that than you ever would from a salad and then the salad doesn't you get no joy from where you would have before because you're actually desensitizing to normal stimuli through normalizing [[hypernormal stimuli]] which is why when you watch enough porn [2995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=2995.44s)

you can't eroticized with normal women right and so porn and fast food and [[social media]] and are all basically optimizing towards [[hypernormal stimuli]] because from a supply side it makes me more money i maximize lifetime revenue and the people have to keep coming and getting a hit and what will appeal to everybody well [[social media]] knows that we're social primates and that we're [3018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3018.15s)

lonely and that what we want to spend all our time doing is looking at other people's faces and like seeing other people and engaging and yet real interactions are vulnerable and difficult so to be able to take the part of the interaction which is where i get a like on the thing i posted and i get to see the photoshop versions of their faces and then other limbic hijacks and [3037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3037.98s)

be able to optimize for that remove all the nutrients of actual authentic human interaction that's what you get and so each of the new platforms that has to emerge in the presence of the existing platforms has to offer some new [[hypernormal stimuli]] yeah the [[social media]] is is something that so it's weird because i've built my business around [[social media]] if you'll grant me i guess that youtube falls into the [[social media]] category which is my primary focus but that's rapidly become the only one that i really spend a lot of time on as just an individual there is something about the way that it the the endless scrolling like if i do it enough when i fall asleep i have this sense of like motion almost but like a very disquieting sense [3085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3085.5s)

of motion almost like a fever dream if you've ever had a fever dream that's just  __  loops so i was like man i can't i can't keep doing this so yeah that the what is happening to minds especially of kids with the change in [[social media]] like i'm always wary of being like you know the old fuddy-duddy who like kids today but when i the thing that freaks me out i want you to imagine [3114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3114.33s)

a world with vr porn and a device that moves in conjunction with what you're seeing in the vr porn that of course is affixed to the more sensitive bits that you have and when i think about i i'm not kidding daniel i wouldn't have graduated high school certainly not with the gpa that i did i if my parents left i would have had that out so fast like the when you can construct different [3141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3141.32s)

people different partners every time that you go in like exaggerate different features like peak shift which i'm sure is something that you know about like you can just peek shift something until it is dysmorphic and your your brain is actually wiring to that thing and when i think about like one of the recommendations that i have for couples if you want like so my wife and i've [3169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3169.83s)

been together almost 20 years and my recommendation to couples is always yo you need to have more sex i can just tell you right now like if you want a good long-lasting relationship the neuro chemistry that cocktail that you get from intimacy is crazy but if you've been living in a vr world that is like your brain has wired to it it is normalized to it and then so that was [3190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3190.14s)

the first one that i sort of put my finger on it was like whew i'm glad i don't have kids cuz that one really  __  scares me like hey parents i used to joke like all the time people that i knew that had kids like man when your kids 14 this  __  is gonna get weird like where technology is going it is going to get weird and if you don't think that there are repercussions [3209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3209.85s)

for that like men it is that one's worrisome but now as i back into just [[social media]] in general and what what it must be like to be 12 or 13 i remember as a kid if you were gonna get sort of gossip bullied they might spray paint something on the bridge that we all drove under to get to school and that was like the height of oh man like you just got burned but now that people can [3231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3231.81s)

create an anonymous account and gang up on somebody at the school that is so gnarly you ever come across the term stochastic terrorism never so if you read sun tzu where you read the thirty-six stratagems or any kind of text on military theory and it doesn't have to be chinese can be anywhere give the enemy to weaken himself is always one of the high principles and so if you [3259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3259.23s)

can see that there's internal dissent within a people or a culture or corporation or whatever and you can increase that internal dissent great right if the goal is to be able to win game a competitively relative to them because you're competing for the same scarce resources whether it's global control or actual physical resources or whatever else so the caste ik terrorism [3284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3284.7s)

you've got groups of people who are very disaffected who find each other online in a 4chan group or an h n group or in a facebook group or in a chatroom of various kinds and talk about hating blacks or hating whites or hating police or hating whatever it is we're hating the kids at school well if i am a state actor or a non-state actor jihad terrorist or whatever i can make fake [3316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3316.32s)

sock puppet accounts go in there and egg them on right share more stuff that pisses them off and gets them upset tell them what a hero they'll be if they do it and it's what we call stochastic terrorism because i don't know exactly who will do what harm at what point but i'm increasing the statistical likelihood that more people will do more harm and if the goal is to [3336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3336.69s)

be able to deal legitimate the enemy or weaken them or whatever that's so easy right that's so easy i've never used to be easy like that as easy as that is it's also easy for any intelligence agency to just watch where the groups of people that are talking about stuff are and be able to share more interesting stuff to see what people are thinking as honey pots for information sharing so [3355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3355.83s)

the thing about the [[arms race]] is that the tools escalate right but we don't have even distribution of the use of those tools and as a result the total asymmetries get more severe and the whole idea that this increased tech that right now i have a computer that gives me access to more information than presidents had 10 years ago if i know how to use google searches and that my [3382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3382.38s)

phone has super computing power if i use amazon cloud or that's mostly just silly because yes it's true that that tech has decentralized capacity in a way but nobody's using their phone to use amazon cloud for super computing capacities to do what groups do with supercomputers or not that many people are using that they're just  __  scrolling facebook and getting their mind hijacked and [3405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3405.51s)

thinking they believe things that they'd that they wouldn't believe otherwise right we're thinking or having emotions or whatever they're being nudged for agendas other than what is good for them or and so when there's so much information right oh these bricks showed up in the protest well they were put there by the cause to incite people to ryan so the cops could use violence and [3428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3428.94s)

they were put there by the far-right and to blame on nt feh no they were really put there by aunty foe no they were put there by soros they were put there by chinese agents they were put there by organized crime they were how do you  __  make sense right look at your speed and depending upon who you curate that you get one of those things if you try to do a good job you'll get all of [3449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3449.04s)

them you'll get overwhelmed and bail right so either you'll get limbic lis and cognitively hijacked into nonsense and be certain that it's true and be willing to go take that and rage action on it or you'll just be overwhelmed have no idea so when there's so much info and so much disinfo and there's so much noise until a little signal but the signal there is is [3469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3469.5s)

disaggregated i don't have all the signal in a place well aggregated for actionable intel access to info isn't what empowers you the ability to info process to parse the signal from the noise aggregate the signal have actionable intel well people don't really have that equally if you think about a top tier quantitative hedge fund and their ability to do ai empowered [3491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3491.49s)

high speed trading with information that comes from lots of private intelligence agencies and big data analysis and the ability to front run other large ones with algorithmic warfare in dark pools on derivatives compared to your ability to understand the market and try to invest we're talking about so many orders of magnitude difference that you have no ability at all to play their [3515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3515.7s)

game when i hear a great dalio talk about that and he's like look you're trying to to play a game that i'm spending hundreds of millions of dollars to play and you you can't win and he i i've met him a couple times and he seems like sincere like i really think he's trying to keep people from putting their hand on the stove and getting burned but it's like he has that peek behind the [3539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3539.52s)

curtain of just the like you said that that description he's living so my question becomes how are you making sense of all this like you're a just a ridiculously intelligent person you can obviously process data very very well so the average person maybe can't do exactly what you do but i think it would be edifying to hear what you do i would love to say things the average person [3562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3562.59s)

can do perfect everything's a term that doesn't actually make any sense to me i don't know average people but something that anyone can start doing progressively more if they want to to understand the world better and the preface for that is if my map is wrong and i'm trying to navigate i'm not gonna get good results right so i my ability to make good choices is it depends upon [3587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3587.04s)

my values what i think is a good choice which you're asking about earlier but also depends upon what i think the actual reality is in the state of play and then what i think the effects of particular actions will be does it be the thing does it invoked our response of the other side that is that i'm trying to do something against it's more intense does [3605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3605.04s)

it create second and third order effects that are worse so like strategy 101 if you aren't factoring counter response right you have a goal you whether it's black lives matter or its [[climate change]] whatever if you recognize that your goal is not shared by everyone and you aren't factoring counter response you aren't doing strategy you're just being [3623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3623.01s)

emotionally hijacked into playing a game for reasons you don't even understand if you aren't factoring second and third-order consequences you're probably making the world worse and so that all means you need to slow the  __  down now this doesn't mean inaction it means the possibility of effective action now feeling effective and being effective aren't the same thing truth and so people have to get off the addiction of wanting to feel effective and actually step back and say wait wait do i even know where what i'm going towards do i understand the lay of the land do i understand the various forces and do i have a path that makes any sense at all so our ability to do choice making well depends on our ability to sense make well which is why controlling [3665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3665.88s)

people [[sensemaking]] is the heart of the war that's happening and the forces that are said this is an important thing in terms of narrative and info warfare and you asked what is power power and a game a sentence is power over other people and there's a lot of ways of getting it some are more evil than others slavery is a particularly bad example but the economic servitude if i can employ you [3690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3690.48s)

and when i'm employing you you are an extension of my will you are no longer doing your own well that's still an example of how do i get power over people to advance some goal that i have right and when we look at left-right its power of that political party to control as many people as possible to get them to vote away so there's the power over the left and right against each other [3714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3714.15s)

and their power over their bases to then be able to have power as a nation over other nations and of classes over other classes and those types of things right because ultimately if i didn't have other people that could do  __  on my behalf i couldn't do that much stuff like if i have to make with my own hands i can't do that much stuff so if i want to do more stuff i'm [3736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3736.529s)

looking at how do i get more people to be able to do that okay so when we start to realize that rather than try to control people's behaviors directly influencing what they feel and what they think and what groups they're engaging in that will ongoingly use groupthink to affect what they think and feel is a much more powerful way than the brunt of the warfare the power game becomes [3764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3764.369s)

control the hearts and minds of people now when you're talking about making more yoda's you aren't trying to control the hearts and minds of people to do your bidding you're trying to say how do i needs them in a direction where they will become more sovereign in self-determining as opposed to become more part of my in-group so what i would say is that that is trying to use the [3791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3791.22s)

tools of power to actually make the game of power less pathological which is a legitimate thing to do and a good thing to do typically the tools of power if if i have [[asymmetric power]] over somebody else and i get a lot of benefit from that i have the capacity because of that [[asymmetric power]] to continue to get more of it and i have the motive to so any business is not just focused on [3816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3816.809s)

providing the thing they provide but increasing their capacity to do stuff and in some places that will be omni positive and in some places will be driving externalities i we celebrate because we just cornered the market which mean we drove a lot of people out of business and they can't feed their kids and we manufacture demand for people to want  __  that they didn't [3833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3833.789s)

want before that doesn't actually make them happier now knowing although your logic but how do people employ this to actually make sense that makes sense yes okay understanding these things already will help that's why i was starting to bring it up when you understand more about that the as much more capacity as the top-level economic players have than you the top-level narrative players and [3864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3864.539s)

information players and they're engaging in that then you realize that people's minds are the battlefield and also the treasure that is trying to be achieved and also the weapons right and so it's important to be like oh wait to what degree in my sovereign self-determining agent to what degree am i thinking i'm a sovereign self determining agent that is actually [3887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3887.58s)

being influenced in ways i don't even recognize dude this is scary man this is like some your mind has been hijacked and you are now acting in the interest of somebody else i don't know why but that just really hit me as you were explaining that like are my ideas my own there was a band back in the 80s called queens reich and they were the first people [3908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3908.25s)

that really got me to think critically so i definitely owe them a debt of gratitude and they had this whole concept album around this guy that was controlling people's minds by basically getting them addicted and then helping them clean up but then like hey i did this for you so you're gonna do this for me it's really terrifying when you couple that with what you were saying [3931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3931.26s)

about [[social media]] and how you've been essentially groomed to push they've pushed you in a direction that you started right depending on what you hovered over and what you clicked on like some you are very involved in this process but the them optimizing right second and third-order consequence is them optimizing for time on site the ability to leverage you to a marketer [3953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3953.07s)

but to do that they're optimizing you in a very specific direction and that that is allowing either bad actor state actors algorithms whatever to hijack your emotions your limbic brain to get you to do whatever like that should scary like when i think about the the thing about what's kicked off with the riots like protesting i love them all for it when it kicked off into like [3982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=3982.32s)

looking out my window and seeing things burning it was like that's where i go okay like you that  __  that gets really scary really fast and when you get into the weeds of like the complicated who's actually breaking the windows who's actually setting the fires and the sort of swirl of very difficult to parse apart things presents itself to you that's where like understanding how [4008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4008.329s)

to begin to extract the information how to learn about something that you don't know about there was a lot of pressure to speak out and i was like i'm not saying  __  until i understand what's actually going on and even just going into that and beginning to realize okay this is a big world this is complicated there's there isn't a party line like it's being presented there are a lot of [4030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4030.71s)

different thinkers across sort of every statement that's being made there's somebody that disagrees with it quite vehemently so my strategy for that and i'd be super curious to to hear what you think on this so i've got what i what we talked about earlier the physics of being human so any any data point that i take in has to jive with what i know is true about humans and the way the humans [4052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4052.4s)

act and think and process and when i see people just repeating mimetic statements over and over and over it's like odds are that's not an original thought for you because you're just repeating the same thing and then also looking at both sides of the argument so it's like i know how algorithms work because as a person with a youtube channel like you have to [4076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4076.13s)

understand how it works to make sure that your stuff is getting presented to people so you learn real fast what the algorithm likes what it doesn't you learn what the algorithm is using as a barometer of whether this is something that should be pushed out more so you pay attention to that stuff so i'm like i know if i watch this type of voice i'm gonna get more of that type of voice so [4093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4093.619s)

then you've got to actively seek out the other side and there's been so many times i'm like whoa like that's brilliant coming from you know side-a and then wow this is brilliant coming from side b and so it's like until i get a sense of like the edges right okay this is edge case over here this is edge case over here now i actually understand filtered through what i know to be true [4114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4114.069s)

of the way that the human mind works now i think i'm beginning to understand this thing and i can begin to sort of try out my own ideas and that's what i do then the next thing so i've taken in all this data the next thing i do and i my poor family one of the coolest things that come out of quarantine has been we now i do these weekly calls with different people [4133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4133.85s)

and i try out ideas on them and i'm like yeah this is how i'm thinking about this what do you think and i begin to realize where oh  __  i thought i understood this but like my own logic is breaking down and in having to articulate it i realize sort of where the edges you know of my ignorance are and that helps me then okay this is where i need to go research i need to figure this out more [4153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4153.92s)

but i don't have a particularly useful way of going oh  __  that was all false propaganda to begin with do you have a way of like are there certain outlets that you trust how do you build trust maybe that's the easiest way trust around information i would say that the idea that there are any authorities that i just trust enough that i can cognitively offload the process of [4190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4190.22s)

coming to belief to them is not a real thing currently and that if you think about legitimate authority whether whatever scene is legitimate authority for a while it was the christian church or government or then the academies and the you know the great ivy league institutions and they're supposed to be the bastions of what is true what's  __  powerful so everyone who wants [4217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4217.34s)

power has maximum incentive to try to capture and co-opt legitimate authority towards the purposes and so you start funding the research institutes to research certain things and not others and even if so i can easily manipulate statistics to say most anything i want to i can cherry-pick that out of very large data sets to say everything's getting better everything's getting [4240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4240.65s)

worse or whatever it is that i want to say we can of course do false methodology in lie but we can even have information that is totally true that is miss representative and will guide people in the wrong direction because let's say i have a phase space of information that's all this information but i'm intentionally only doing research on this area over here and [4263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4263.57s)

publishing a bunch of research the pond endurance of data points to such and such because there was an uneven distribution of what funded based on those dollars came from somewhere and they're seeking return on investment and so certain things are going to be more useful a patentable pharma drug is going to give more research dollars than a plant-based nutrient that no one can [4284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4284.85s)

patent to ever be able to pay the money back so the preponderance of data will say nutrients don't work as well as harmon drugs do but the preponderance of that is gibberish in that particular case and then also what metrics was it looking at well it didn't cause any negative side effects because we look for these for side effects well the body is pretty  __  complicated you can [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4306.06s)

cause lots of side effects that are outside of those few measures so as soon as you understand the process of legitimate authority having a maximum incentive to get co-opted then you start understanding okay this idea that i can offload the cognitive complexity of the world to an authority where i can continue to have a childlike consciousness and find the parent who [4327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4327.18s)

will tell me how the world is and what to do stops being a desirable goal and the desire to take the responsibility to make sense to increasingly make sense of the world myself now that doesn't become solipsistic where i think i'm not gonna pay attention to people who spend a lot of time studying but let's say i'm looking at co vid and i'm looking at the topic of viral origin did it come from a [4352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4352.56s)

wet market naturally zoonotic li did it come from gain-of-function research accidentally or intentionally bio warfare or let's say i'm looking at conferred immunity well getting it confer immunity so we'll reach our immunity well getting it confirm unity for some people but not others or for a short period of time where will not actually create enduring herd immunity [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4373.89s)

or will it create a de antibody dependent enhancements where then one of the normal coronaviruses will kill you next time you get it nobody knows you can tell you from looking at the research the answer to that is not known and so all the stuff on sweden's about to reach her term unity or this or like is all just people overextending what could actually be known so one of the [4395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4395.4s)

key things is being able to identify what things do we have high confidence on based on what process and what things do we not have high confidence in just acknowledging that so that's a question i'm always asking what are the knowns and what are the things that we know we don't know or at least we and the knowns are never a hundred percent certain right there's [4415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4415.04s)

some bayesian confidence margin less than 100 percent but i can say high confidence based on this process but i'm still open to new data and then here's the area of unknown so i want no certainty at all here because any certainty at all even a hunch can bias me in terms of what i pay attention to so i just want to say i don't know do you try to eliminate even your hunches [4433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4433.64s)

like do you all the hunches you try to what i try to run all of it i see so if i say there's a virologist who thinks or an immunologist who thinks one thing we will get immunity and someone else thinks we won't and based on different ways that they're waiting data so do i pick do i think that experts who spent thirty years studying a field more smart know things i don't that i should listen [4457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4457.55s)

to that is different than like what a tv personality who doesn't know anything about things yes so i like will find experts who disagree but that seem earnest as opposed to seem like they are doing some piece of propaganda and then i like to see the dialectic where i think possible you gonna have to tell people what a dialectic is how does it different how is it different from a [4478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4478.22s)

debate so yeah this is important topic i saw you and eric weinstein discussing this a bit so dialectic is the idea that you can have a couple different perspectives that each have some truth value in them but maybe neither of which are the whole truth and they're rather than a debate where the idea is one of them is true one isn't and there's going to be some kind of rhetorical warfare [4502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4502.7s)

and then someone will be the winner at the end there's aco exploration coming from different perspectives to see can we actually find the higher-order truth together doing this i'm super obsessed with this so the the idea of trying to find a higher-order truth that this is you want to know what really grinds my gears the fact that do people not give a  __  about what actually works like i [4525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4525.86s)

swear to god people just want to be right and as somebody who used to be stuck in that loop i get it i have empathy i  __  have empathy but man everything in my life changed when i stopped trying to be right and i started saying because my thing was i was and trust me when i get the example i'm about to give you is like game a to the max but when i was [4545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4545.27s)

younger my focus was entirely on getting rich but i wasn't acting i wasn't acting like i wanted to get rich i was acting like i wanted to be right and so there was a day where they collided and it was like i was arguing for an idea in the business because it was mine and it was a voice in my head saying you know this is wrong this isn't gonna work this is gonna move [4563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4563.989s)

the business backwards but i needed to be right and so i kept fighting for it i ended up getting my way my partner's left and i was like the  __  am i doing like i know that what i just convinced them to do will move us backwards so do i want to be right or do i want to be rich and finally i realized jesus man if i could build my self-esteem around something else then i could actually [4584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4584.75s)

achieve my goals but if i was focused on just being right that i was never going to get where i wanted to go and when i look at the screaming that's happening right now i i don't think it ends in actually improving this situation i don't think that by the rhetoric that i'm seeing about like defunding cops know that that we're actually going to get to the beautiful place that i think [4609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4609.32s)

people want to get to so it's like you're not going to be able to figure out how to actually solve the problem unless somebody can propose hey let's defund the police okay brad let's look at that hey no this is what we need to do over here cool let's look at that like when you can actually stop and look at it you can get to the goal but like i said at the beginning most people don't [4631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4631.67s)

know what their actual goal is they can't state it and then on top of that they're so worried about being right or sticking to the party line or whatever that they're they're not in this dialectic where you're bringing like lincoln with his team of rivals i was like that's so powerful in a business i go way out of my way to make sure that my team challenges my thinking that if [4653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4653.75s)

you're an intern challenge me if you think i'm saying something stupid  __  tell me because i might be actually being stupid and i have so much on the line all i care about is the truth and that's like one of those things it will be better for you you will be happier if you focus on actually getting what you want but it is it's one of those things [4674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4674.06s)

man the physics of being human by default people want to be right by default doesn't mean that they can't switch it up and change but jesus by default people want to be right there's this ted talk this woman gave it's one of my favorite ted talks and i think it's called on being wrong it was a she was describing a book she had written which was studying the [4695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4695.51s)

psychology of humans experience of being wrong and she asked the audience what does it feel like to be wrong and people said embarrassing shameful whatever and she goes no that's what it feels like to find out you were wrong haha you like to be wrong is to feel right right typically where we're at we actually think we were right about stuff were wrong about that's instead what it was [4719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4719.179s)

like as righteousness and so you were fortunate in that you knew you were full of  __  right that was actually fortunate most people when they are righteous and adamant and filled with you know passion and certainty actually think they're right that's much more dangerous because then it becomes harder to reflect on what the  __  am i doing do you think they have [4739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4739.79s)

unease or they are are there people who truly have no sense okay so memes live in complexes that create worldviews it are self perpetuating and self reinforcing so let's say we take a particular fundamentalist religious mean plex and there's a bunch of different ideas there's ideas about if i die in holy war then i go to heaven and there's eternal [4771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4771.11s)

life and there's hell and so i've got both i've got all of the evolutionary biology on punishment motives plus reward motives plus authority motives plus the desire for certainty plus in-group stuff plus the desire to not be out grouped right it's appealing to every level of maslow's hierarchy every emotional aspect of evolutionary biology but then you've you've got core memes [4790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4790.58s)

you've got supportive memes you have protector memes like a whole football team and the protector moons are anything that would  __  up believing that there is way to deal with it right so doubt comes from the devil and will make you burn in hell forever and faith is the highest virtue which basically says critical thinking is evil and creates maximum [4813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4813.63s)

limbic fear for you so the prefrontal cortex that would try and do the critical thinking will end up stimulating the amygdala to shut off the prefrontal cortex and so that's actually a very neurologically advanced protector moon complex to make sure that the thing that could get you to question if all these beliefs are actually unfounded gibberish won't be effective against you [4834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4834.63s)

and so most worldviews have protector means built-in and so that even if i'm feeling uncomfortable i have a way of rationalizing it do you so i've heard you talk about this before and i thought this is so brilliant how do you go from jesus saying all the lovely things bringing people together to fighting the crusades in his name like how you do the mental gymnastics do [4864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4864.0s)

you know like what was the protector meme in that meme complex that allowed people to pull that off when the ss troupe were being tried in the hague for war crimes after world war two i don't remember the exactly the questions were phrased but they were being asked questions to determine to try to understand the phenomena of what happened how germany that had been very [4889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4889.74s)

actual liberal before moved into that place and also the likelihood for those people to commit similar actions again and so they were asked all the questions specific to the situation they were in but then they were asked general questions of the type did you believe everything you were doing was right and one of the things are so fascinating was something like 90% of the nazi said no i [4909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4909.78s)

didn't believe everything i was doing was right i did at the beginning when we were hearing about what an oppressed people we were and the bad people that were trying to oppress us and the jews seemed to be rich when we were poor as  __  in the land republic and had to be selling our kids into slavery and like it seemed like they were doing it consciously and we were just standing up [4928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4928.05s)

for ourselves and so originally i did but then we started to get into places that were really  __  and so 90% of them said no i didn't think it was alright then they're asked did you ever try and stop and a hundred percent of them said no i never tried to stop and then when they were asked why they would quote german phrases that had been drilled into their heads who were [4946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4946.76s)

basically officers orders and if i if i went against this i'd be putting the gas chamber and i wouldn't have made any difference like the whale saying if i don't do it somebody else will right and i have my kids to deal with and i didn't have the power to stop it and the and yet ninety percent of the people actually felt that way right so the same is true with the inquisition's or the or [4970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4970.58s)

the crusades or the and it's even true today of if you grow up in a very religious area what is what happens if you give up on the religion right so we know what the punishment for apostasy and fundamentalist islam is but if you grew up in utah in the strict mormon area and you give up on mormonism then you get excommunicated depending upon how they relate to it you lose all of [4995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=4995.63s)

the benefits your in-group completely destroys maybe the idea that you're going to lose heaven and all those kinds of things so people believe things less because they are true and more because they are useful than they realize useful and staying in the group staying in the good graces meeting some need mostly people believe things because it seems like it will meet some need for them or [5021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5021.79s)

believing something else will damage that need and then they rationally backfill epistemology but they didn't do a pistol nology to come to the belief they emotionally came to the belief and then they backfill epistemology so rationalizing is the opposite of being rational being rational is not starting those well synced being rational is starting with i don't know let's go [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5045.489s)

through the process let's try what are all the hypotheses what is the evidence for all the hypotheses rationalizing is i jump straight to belief and now i'm going to try to create backfilled rationale for it and pretend that that's how i got there i'll give you actually a really interesting example one the things the political left and the us likes to do is make fun of the political [5068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5068.87s)

right for being stupid you can see this with bill maher or other kinds of comedians and it's part of their [[narrative warfare]] strategy feeling superior through being more educated and whatever and and the political rate has it's methods of [[narrative warfare]] and so i'm not commenting on the rightness or not of the underlying ideas but the the weaponry that's genius [5093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5093.56s)

and nobody wants to feel really stupid and so you actually stay in group by laughing at the people who are on the out group as opposed to defending the people who are so obviously stupid that you're obviously stupid if you would even sympathize with them at all right so that's actually appealing to very not rational things in-group out-group desire not to seem stupid in the name of [5116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5116.48s)

higher intellect so it's very tricky and sophisticated so there's a left comedian who went to some trump rallies recently and interviewed trump supporters and made a compilation of how utterly stupid trump supporters are now of course he didn't include any of the places where there trump supporters that are well educated and have good philosophy and there are other ones that will show [5141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5141.62s)

right oriented people going to a bunch of left or and tifa people and making them look like utter idiot so they'll both use that tactic right so of course the first thing we have to see is as we're laughing at the dumb trump supporters in this thing it was cherry picked for that purpose of all of the people to then give the sense that that was ubiquitous that they're all that [5160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5160.22s)

done right okay so you watch the thing and it's actually impressive how much these people have rejected there's actually pride around anti-intellectualism within this population there's a particular part of the right that has a anti intellectual pride and so they the guy is you know saying very basic things about government or how bill becomes a law or [5183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5183.46s)

whatever intentionally like showing how stupid the people are that they don't know the basics of politics and they're certain of wrong things and whatever and then tries to take it further and says if if if trump used the n-word would you vote for him yeah i'd still vote for him if he whatever and they ran different thing and at one point it said something like [5200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5200.69s)

if trump said that everyone need to start  __  pigs would you vote for him yea i'd still vote for him and what it was trying to say isn't that guy who says yeah i'd still vote for him is saying my mind is not open to new ideas like my mind has closed to new ideas i have already made my decision i'm going with it so you have to say what made him get there well one of the things that's [5222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5222.17s)

actually insightful is he intuited in someplace that he couldn't make sense of what was going on and when the pundits were talking it was above his head and that they were trying to use intellectualism and data and statistics and whatever to say things that felt like they were gonna  __  his world up that weren't in his interest right that seemed against his interest and so he [5246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5246.71s)

basically said i know my mind he's not this sophisticated but subconsciously i know my mind is a battleground of people more sophisticated than me who are gonna try to convince me what is true but i don't think they have my interest in mind so this trump guy it doesn't matter if it's true or not i actually feel safer being on his side in a world that feels like it's in more he feels more [5269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5269.9s)

like me and he feels like he might win and i don't want the susceptibility of people trying to confuse me to be possible so it's very interesting to see how the that anti intellectual thing was actually a compensating weapon of intellectual weapons being used to control people in ways that they could tell weren't fully in their interest that that's really interesting and this [5296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5296.86s)

is where cognitive distribution to make it sound fancy the fact that sadly not all mines are created equal it's like man when you have like when i look at people that are clearly smarter than me i'm just like dude this is deeply problematic to try to make sense of what they're saying and to engage with what they're saying it is i get it man i feel for people when it it you you can tell [5327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5327.139s)

you're being moved around the board like a chess piece and you're not sure like where the trap is coming but you know that there is a trap coming and hold on one second because i have an alarm going off all right sorry about that i am normally i don't film this late so i didn't even think to check my bad so yeah when you've got somebody that is [5360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5360.639s)

just you know outperforming you and you can feel that you're being moved around that chess board it is so disconcerting that i can see how people would end up shutting down and so this is why we like debates as we think okay that guy is saying something that i seem to disagree with but he's smarter than me i want to put my smart or candidate up to battle with him right and the higher angel of [5384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5384.79s)

our nature is wanting to actually understand by them going back and forth and then being smart enough to come up with the counters that we wouldn't have known the lower angels of our nature is just watching a dog fight and that's why you'll see sam harris eviscerates noam chomsky or whatever those type of title that go around it's really those people when they're watching aren't trying to [5408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5408.28s)

learn they're trying to and that's why you'll see in a debate the people who are very very strong fans of one of the people are sure that person one at the end on both sides so our mind really moved because that's actually not appealing to the higher angels of their epistemic drive but the lower angels of their desire because this is the thing there isn't some way at the end to [5430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5430.21s)

determine which one is actually right clearly so the guy who's making the arguments of the people who resonate with the type of arguments he likes his arguments resonate with him is true and the other one don't resonate is true and ultimate leave my sense of truthiness is kind of a felt sense dude let me tell you as somebody who does a lot of public speaking i will tell you right now that [5450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5450.67s)

i can move an audience by changing not what i say but how i say it and i learned very early on that by putting time and energy into getting good at the performative layer of a talk mm made a huge difference and so when i was young i wanted to be a stand-up comic and so i spent a lot of time in front of audiences i spent a lot of time practicing like what i was doing with my [5475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5475.75s)

face modulating my voice and it is it is a little it's exciting when you feel like you're doing things for the right reasons but it's a little unnerving when i think about like charisma goes a long way man just by the way that you make somebody feel they always say you don't remember what somebody did or what they said you remember how they made you feel and so [5498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5498.91s)

if you can make somebody feel good if you can hype them up and i tell audiences all the time and this is sort of the core friction of my life is i have what i call a two-hour declining arc of influence so if you if you get me in a room with somebody my whole thing is get me in the room if you give me the room i will  __  make somebody feel something i can be very persuasive when [5516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5516.91s)

i really believe in something and i'm really passionate because i can bring that out and i can energy infects other people and so you can infect them with your enthusiasm you can get them hyped up but as soon as i walk away it's like it that sense of like because i try to give people the sense that they can do it right whatever it is like you can do it you can make it come true and let me [5535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5535.54s)

tell you and i know that when i walk away that feeling begins to wane and so it's like how do you get beyond just the the ability to whip people into an emotional frenzy and actually get them to think critically to form an opinion to say okay i actually think i understand how these pieces work together and then it's like you can begin to form your own opinion then you [5556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5556.75s)

can you know how to move to a world but otherwise how to do that for your listeners right now how to please how because similar this conversation might have some impact on them for like a day maybe right but the moment they have scrolled their facebook feed they've forgotten about it and they're now fully inundated with other things and so how why would why do we bother doing this at [5582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5582.94s)

all so if someone is feeling a particular kind of resonance and inspiration they have to take some actions it will keep it feeding or nurturing that and so let's talk about a few things people can do because when you're in the room with them whether it's just that you're giving them better information or you're emotionally influencing them they're influenced by [5604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5604.84s)

what they're around and so if some but then when you leave they're influenced by whatever they're around next what you're trying to do is make them have more a internal locus of control to be more self influencing well the the kind of influence i would say illegitimate power in a game be sense illegitimate power is where i'm trying to influence people [5627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5627.14s)

towards my agenda perpetually legitimate power is where i'm trying to influence them to be more self directing which is basically what a good parent or a teacher is trying to do is to increase someone's capacity to make their own good [[sensemaking]] their own good decisions and whereas to the degree that i'm trying to convince them what to think that aligns with an agenda i have [5651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5651.59s)

that is a you know [[game theory|game theoretic]] thing that will then produce counter responses of other people who want to convince some of some other thing but as people are seeking to become more self-determined the first thing is to recognize how much you are not self determined to recognize how much the information streams coming into your eyes and ears and who you around [5679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5679.43s)

influences and start changing that one of the best acts of self-determination is to change the things other than you that are influencing you and so we talked about the problem of [[social media]] if you care about your own well-being enough you'll just quit [[social media]] your own well-being in your ability to understand the world and you'll start finding sources of news that are better [5700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5700.01s)

than [[social media]] that aren't ai curated for limbic optimization for you but that you're curating based on what seems to be good information and you'll find left sources and right sources and sources from other countries and whatever to try to make sense of stuff if you are going to stay on [[social media]] there are some things you can do to do a better job which is let's say that you are [5721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5721.94s)

politically aligned in a direction you're left aligned go find all of the right thinkers and follow them and join a bunch of those groups if you're right aligned do that with the left whatever your particular perspective is and find the ones that seem to be the most actually smart and earnest and then unfollow all the stuff that seems to be salacious and not well researched so [5749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5749.27s)

that your feed becomes the smartest stuff from all of the perspectives and if this is working you'll become less certain about everything you'll know that it is working because you will know more than you knew before and you'll be less certain whereas right now you know less and you're more certain yeah that i think that's really powerful and the thing i i'm really obsessed with this [5771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5771.89s)

idea i want people to understand that what i normally say is skills have utility but information has utility and man i don't care from where on the political spectrum an idea comes from if it's real if it has real-world implications and it lets me move towards a goal that i have i'm gonna take it and i actually cannot understand anything else [5795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5795.02s)

so it's there they're powerful i didn't this all came for me because of building businesses like when your house is on the line you don't have time to worry about whether you thought of the idea or somebody else thought of the idea or somebody you like thought of it or somebody you don't like thought of it it's just like jesus dude i don't wanna have to go home and tell my wife that we [5815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5815.66s)

have to move out because we'd lost the house like that was such a real thing for me and that kicked me into just a and i had already been sort of marching down that path but that kicked me into a whole nother level of like i just need to know what works man i need to know what works i have a goal i need to know what's gonna move me towards that goal and it also it felt better like there [5833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5833.06s)

there's a sense of relaxing because i'm not trying to posture i'm not trying to campaign i used to say all the time and unfortunately i was wrong about this but i used to say all the time to people just be good because you can't campaign and convince people that you're good now the sad reality is you actually can you can bamboozle a lot of  __  people with a lot of words but being good [5852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5852.92s)

itself is gonna take you a lot farther and the getting people interested in that like gamifying in themselves like okay cool i want this curated feed that is bringing me a diverse array of opinions so that i can actually function and if people got into that idea of functioning but the goal here is to function it's to actually be useful to be able to so i define power very differently than you but the way that i define power and maybe it's just the wrong word at least for this conversation is power is being able to close your eyes imagine a world better than this one open your eyes and actually have the skills to move towards that to make that real and i have become so obsessed with that idea that it helps like that becomes almost the filter by [5903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5903.0s)

which i make sense of the world like if i really think about like what's what's one of my highest level filters it's like i only do and believe that which moves me towards my goals and if you're good at choosing your goal then you suddenly become open to any good idea from wherever even if it contradicts like i came into it thinking one thing but like whoa that's actually more [5923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5923.58s)

that's real that's actually going to take me it's not something i ever thought like i never thought that and i don't know enough about [[game b]] to know if like i'm behind it or not but it's like hey if [[game b]] ends up being the most real thing and there is a way to deal with the just freakish amount of complexity and that we actually can consciously build something that moves [5944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5944.87s)

us towards that and it becomes a my values would definitely be sustainability human well-being like those are sort of inextricably connected wanting the human race to go on long after i'm here wanting people to struggle but struggle well so that they can be tough and be resilient like those are all things that to me seem inherently good more than say happiness [5971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5971.16s)

or something like that which is very transient but like seeking out the things that will actually get me there and the process of iteration and at the risk of just completely derailed on tangents here that to me that sort of mixture of like iterate get it out there try be sincere in the pursuit of what's actually going to move you towards your goal like that is you know if i had [5995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=5995.49s)

magic fairy dust that could sprinkle on people to get them to act in accordance with that i think they would be happier and it certainly would lead to a better world in my estimation this is interesting and at the risk of opening a very big can of worms did do i remember right that you said that it isn't necessarily true that improving the individual will improve [6019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6019.82s)

society or am i miss remembering that it is not necessarily true that improving some subset of individuals in a particular way will improve society like okay someone getting better at violin is improving them it's improving their skills someone getting better at warfare is improving their skills so is society the result of the quality of the members yes but are the members also the result [6058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6058.13s)

of the quality of the civilization systems like the education and the economics and the culture and the governance that help condition and develop them also yes so it's not just bottom up individuals to society or just top down the quality of a society of oak's different things from individuals there's a recursion there so i but i don't think there's a tangent there i [6081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6081.56s)

doing that go down i want to go back to something you said a moment ago when you were talking about the desire to be right and how problematic that was and when you let that go you go in that way makes you very easy to control because all i have to do is appeal to your desire to feel right and i can control you i can give you information that i have taken more time than you have the [6108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6108.14s)

process to frame it up that will make you feel right and i can do pick what you believe i can also inflame you into emotion by attacking your sense of rightness or whatever so having a fragile ego that wants to seem right and that is fragile ii identified with certain positions makes you very very vulnerable to control so that's an important thing having a mindset where [6130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6130.73s)

anything can be brought up and your identities not attached to specific belief structures the belief could change and you don't crumble as a result of it makes you much more resilient yeah resiliency is is one of those things from an intrinsic standpoint that if people want that in themselves and they're actually willing to put that to use you can begin to get anti fragile [6158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6158.57s)

and anti fragility in terms of building a new society i know is a is going to be a pretty important thing do you think that we have any ideas that could actually cause so antifragility for anybody that's never heard the phrase before the more you attack it the stronger it becomes so what on earth would that look like at the societal level i i it is a failure of imagination [6185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6185.42s)

for me i can't imagine it capitalism has been anti-federal as a system of resource distribution and etc it it has continued to evolve its capacities so we went from say barter to exchange mediated by currency to fiat currency to fractional reserve vehicles the attacks upon it that made it stronger well if one capitalist group say another nation or whatever was trying to advance their [6228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6228.17s)

overall share of the pie relative to another one they kept each strengthening their underlying capitalist base becoming better at extraction exchange those types of things when communism was emerging as an alternate system it increased its capacity to be productive and defend itself and whatever so that's an example of antifragility you were asking earlier how does someone go from [6250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6250.97s)

the forgiveness of jesus to the to the crusades there was a belief system christianity they continued to get stronger and buy stronger it meant as it was attacked by other religious ideologies or or political ideologies it was increasing its and this actually interesting because anti fragile is not always good because sometimes it just means the thing is getting better at [6274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6274.97s)

warfare i actually want to bring up the trump campaign has elements of antifragility so whether it was stormy daniels or the russia issue or the impeachment his base actually got stronger through each of those and so one of the things that the left has not recognized they failed to recognize the antifragility and that they were lobbying attacks that would [6306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6306.86s)

lose but would actually strengthen and so that's such an important thing to recognize because if something has become antique red jewel and you think it's bad you're going against it you have to think in a different way and actually i'll use trump as an example here the thing you were mentioning around listening to diverse opinions so we we know that he's a different kind of [6333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6333.409s)

president and the politically trained ones that have been there before whether people think that he is saving the nation from the corrupt evil deep state or whether he is destroying it to create his own evil dynasty is one of the classically polarized things that people have a hard time grounding enough they grounded in the thing that resonates is true to them [6356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6356.42s)

without seeing the other things but i think everyone knows he's been effective at a particular thing i know a couple people who have been who worked with him closely been on the security council or you know in his advisory board who've said the same thing about their experience working with him in the presidential or what said one same thing and i found very interesting is that [6378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6378.23s)

where most of the president's previously had positions that were fairly consistent and predictable bush did kind of bush things and obama did kind of obama things and they got people around them that had a similar ideology and that had for some period of time right the obama democrats before they were obama democrats were clinton democrats they were of a certain type and same in [6398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6398.869s)

bush republicans trump got people who were mostly not of that of a particular lineage system and he got people who disagreed with each other via mentally and so if he would bring at reyes into a room and bannon into a room together to talk about china because they both knew more about it than he didn't he knew that but they disagreed vehemently then what they what [6422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6422.93s)

i was told would happen in the room is that he would invite a group of people in without giving them any events notice of what they were going to talk about so they couldn't prepare how to manipulate while thinking so he got their extemporaneous real sense he brought in people who disagreed he would ask a question without giving an indication of what he thought he'd keep a poker face [6443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6443.69s)

on the whole time to not indicate that what he believed and you just keep asking questions and have them fight it out and and he would actually sit there quietly and listen for a couple hours and once he had heard enough then he still wouldn't tell them what he thought he'd go straight to twitter because he didn't care if they agreed with him or not he cared of his support base did and [6463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6463.73s)

twitter gave him an innocent way to communicate with the support base and get real-time analytics based on the big data analysis of the twitter feed of whether what he was saying was coalescing his support base or not wow and so that is an effective technology where what he's doing is listening to different viewpoints now he was listening for is not necessarily what is [6484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6484.43s)

true but will be effective for coalescing my support base but he also had much more direct communication with people and much faster feedback now also when you don't have a position kind of like bruce lee said about martial arts right when you don't have a fixed form when you don't have rigorous positions you can take the position that is coalescing the support base empirical [6506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6506.06s)

more which is both terrible and wonderful depending upon what your whole is woo man so yeah this is i'm i'm i'm not surprised by this conversation given that you are the person i came across when researching the end of the world and how civilizations crumble dude the way that you are taking the entire ecosystem of things that have to be taken into consideration into [6534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6534.29s)

consideration it is it is very interesting i'm gonna be watching you very carefully with what you continue to put out in terms of game be and how we move forward intelligently i think we're in a weird time but dude thank you for coming on the show thank you for and maybe you would warn me against us but thank you for being a part of my [[sensemaking]] apparatus i will not take you literally i will definitely look things up and form my own opinions but man you definitely fall into the category of people that i think are saying things in a rational way a metered way that makes a lot of sense to me so word thank you it's good to be here it's fun to have the conversation with you dude no joke hopefully we will connect again soon and [6578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-Xn2gzGxU&t=6578.53s)
