today's conversation is with my friend and colleague daniel schmucktenberger daniel and i met a couple years ago turns out he's working on what he refers to as the [[metacrisis]] how climate and geopolitics and [[artificial intelligence]] and everything fit together into this collective of risks i had never heard of him and he had never heard of me or my work or my [24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=24.16s)

network looking at energy money growth ecology and we talked on the phone and the first time i talked to him i'll never forget it we talked for three hours and at one time in the conversation i got goosebumps on my left arm because he connected ideas that were in my head that i had never connected [46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=46.48s)

and those of you that know daniel uh and listen to his podcast know that he often does someone's thinking for them he's that sort of a of an intellect daniel's current main focus is on the risks that [[social media]] and [[artificial intelligence]] pose as this exponentially growing function that's hijacking our minds as [70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=70.24s)

individuals and at a cultural level is impeding or even negating our collective ability to orient and adapt to our our current challenges daniel and i always talk for hours i wish i would have recorded our previous long phone conversations but we decided to start recording with this one our intent was to lay the foundation of [93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=93.6s)

what i refer to as the energy blindness of our culture and how many people miss the relationship between technology energy money and growth and what that means for our future constraints what we intended on doing is merging my story on the macro [[superorganism]] that we self-organize uh towards profits the profits are tethered to energy which [121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=121.2s)

are tethered to carbon and there's a growth imperative in there and merge that with his story of an a.i induced profit-seeking call it microorganism capturing our attention into a grand synthesis of the human predicament and how we can steer society in the future towards bending instead of breaking in the coming decade [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=143.84s)

in an unexpected way daniel ended up interviewing me in this podcast so it was a bit weird but i hope you find it helpful and interesting background to the part two in the series in the near future which is going to be taking a deeper dive of how these things fit together and part three will be the bend versus break how we should think about this what we [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=167.12s)

should do as individuals and as a culture i hope you enjoy the conversation daniel good to see you my friend good to see you my friend happy to be in this discussion with you today we scheduled this like uh three weeks ago and i've had three weeks to think about creative ways to shape my beard to compete with yours and i decided i'm [197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=197.36s)

just going to settle for some beard compersion and be be in awe of your beard and compersion is a word that you taught me which is instead of being jealous you can be happy for other people's magnificence well-being etc so welcome i shaved off my giant coveted beard uh before we did our podcast so is that right okay [220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=220.48s)

okay so daniel you and i have known each other on two years now um i found you because many of my friends were sending links to your talks saying you guys have to join forces and and have a conversation we've now spent a couple weeks in person working on uh various projects dealing with technology [[social media]] risks to governance and [[sensemaking]] etc and um you know i i just feel a um you know a deep bond with the fact that you are living your life in a similar way to i am not knowing all the answers but striving for some pro-social cultural transition and educating and inspiring people so uh i'm i'm very happy that um you're on the [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=270.8s)

program yeah i was really happy that you were starting this podcast and i'm excited about the uh things you get to talk about today so so real briefly so for people in my network that don't know about you could you briefly describe your work a little bit of consilience uh project and what you're trying to do uh yeah roughly i have been [292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=292.0s)

as a kid was interested in environmental topics social justice topics animal rights topics all different kinds of activism and um also then had a deep interest in uh kind of system science and looking at how all of those problems had certain interconnections where you could solve [315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=315.6s)

one problem but display some of the problems somewhere else or had common drivers like perverse economic incentive and [[collective action]] issues and started forecasting and seeing that many of those problems were reaching critical tipping points of global [[catastrophic risk]] and that just kind of got me thinking [332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=332.479s)

about how do we make a mature civilization that can be a safe steward of [[exponential tech]] the power that [[exponential tech]] gives and what is a civilization that makes it through its technological adolescence look like and uh so that looked like [[catastrophic risk]] next essential risk kind of assessment and rethinking our [[social system|social systems]] governance economics law rethinking our kind of cultural and [[value system|value systems]] educational process music and obviously also rethinking our uh technological systems how do we make a technosphere and a social sphere that are in harmony with the biosphere long term and uh so what we're focused on with consensus project right now towards those kind of big picture goals is how to frame up the actual state of the world the [[metacrisis]] that so many different environmental issues and [[exponential tech]] mediated x-risk issues and economic and [[supply chain]] issues are all part of right that there's a profound interconnection of these things there's some core underlying stuff that has to get addressed how do we frame up the [[metacrisis]] well enough and what the design criteria of its solution not one solution there'll be lots of different things that have to happen but the right design criteria are that a lot more of the world can start [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=410.8s)

innovating in the uh you know in a well-informed direction and that's through papers through kind of strategic education of people in specific institutions and verticals and you know discussions like this and obviously this is how we got connected uh from my side was a friend connecting us because of you [432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=432.319s)

having a big picture story on what the what the kind of [[metacrisis]] and overview of the state of the world is what some specific near-term [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] that are pretty fundamental are that are being really under addressed which i'm excited to actually dive into today even though it's a subset of the whole topic the energy blindness topic [452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=452.319s)

because it really is something that you um emphasize well and clearly that a is so underrepresented in the overall uh assessment of the state of the world so yeah that's a bit i was happy that you uh to discover that you and i both use uh the same anthropological uh reference to to frame [475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=475.479s)

some of our work um the work of cultural anthropologist marvin harris called cultural materialism he frames all historical human cultures have something in common they have a [[superstructure]] which is the uh ideologies the beliefs the memes the stories that the culture tells in the middle is the structure which is the [499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=499.759s)

institutions and the rules and the laws and the [[economic system]] but underpinning it all is the infrastructure which is the energy and the throughput and the waste streams and how the system functions and so you and i both agree that what's coming in the coming decades is we're going to have to solve all three of those we're going to have to move them [523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=523.68s)

together but and i think that's what we're going to talk about today is a lot of people work on just one of those areas and we're going to need all synthesized but the energy materials growth money technology story when we talk about cultural transitions [546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=546.48s)

that is not as as fluent and as frequently dove into as as you know social cultural change and so i thought today you and i could kind of take uh our version of a deep dive into that um though it is a bit of a strange thing to do this being one of the early shows in your new podcast i like the idea of me getting to kind of ask you some questions regarding your core frames in this area since we've dialogued a lot and i happen to know them and i think they're important and it's always tricky when you have expertise in a topic and you host the podcast you're holding context for other people's content this might be a nice [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=591.68s)

way to get some of the core content through so that your listeners and maybe future people coming on the show will have that as some of the context to speak into so i would like to talk with you specifically about the bend not break model as you propose it and energy blindness and why that is both near term and central though that is obviously a subset of all [612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=612.56s)

the things for us to talk about and hopefully we'll do more of these uh does that sound good yeah great so um i have a music elevator pitch about the human predicament and how we got here and then there's a lot of uh components there but maybe i'll just start with that and then you just dive in and interject and push [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=634.56s)

back and ask questions so energy is fundamental to nature energy is the currency of life in natural systems organisms and ecosystems that self-organize around any energy capture have an evolutionary advantage if you don't have surplus energy as an animal you can't reproduce and and [657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=657.04s)

have uh misses and have uh um homeostasis and everything so the ratio of energy return to the energy invested as caloric pursuit in nature the huge driver and that also applies to human systems and we've been a species for 300 000 years and for 290 000 of those years we were hunter gatherers we worked [683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=683.519s)

you know 20 20 hours a week and the rest of the time rested and told stories and everything and then when the climate changed around 10 000 years ago it warmed and stabilized in no fewer than seven places on earth did we stop our hunter-gatherer ways [702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=702.399s)

and start more agricultural ways and what we were doing there is spending we were time minimizing we were accessing more energy surplus and we were able to store it it wasn't just meat that would go bad after a week it was grain which we could store and that would even out [722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=722.88s)

the feast or famine in coming months and what that allowed to happen is we had access so we could have more higher population we could trade uh with other areas we could devote other people to be warriors or priests or accountants or guards or whatever and so the agricultural revolution changed everything about humans [749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=749.04s)

and you fast forward to [[nation state|nation states]] and beyond and we started to expand around the world and then we happened upon a vast bounty of energy surplus that was stored underneath the earth and since the 1800s or so we have been drawing down this energy battery which is the stored carbon and hydrocarbons in the form of oil coal and [773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=773.839s)

natural gas 10 million times faster than it was sequestered uh by the daily trickle charge of photosynthesis in the deep past of earth and our [[economic system]] is treating this as if it were interest when it actually is our principle this fossil hydrocarbons are [796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=796.72s)

unbelievably powerful relative to what humans did with muscle and animal labor before them one barrel of oil daniel and i'm sure you know this has 5.7 million british thermal units worth of energy which translates to 1700 kilowatt hours of work potential you or i digging ditches or hauling hay [821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=821.12s)

bales or planting potatoes generate around six tenths of a watt of uh power in a work day versus seventeen hundred and sixty kilowatt hours so one barrel of oil does around five years of our work and all we have to do is pay for the cost of extraction from getting it out of the earth so if [844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=844.639s)

it costs 50 for us to get it out of the earth we sell it to the market at 60 and we our [[economic system]] treats that as if it were um just the same as any other sixty dollars um an expensive haircut or some food or some earmuffs or whatever it is [866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=866.24s)

and energy is needed for absolutely everything in our economies there is no substitute for energy other than another form of energy so basically we have now we need energy for everything that results in a good or service in our gdp so right now it doesn't have to be this [890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=890.32s)

way in the future but right now gdp is cannot decouple from energy because it's a measure of uh how much stuff we burn it's goods and services and there's energy that is required to refine uh deliver maintain run and dispose of every product on earth and we can get into that a little bit [912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=912.639s)

but let me finish the um the thesis so we now are in a culture that optimizes uh for growth and we as uh individuals as families as small businesses as corporations as as [[nation state|nation states]] we are trying to maximize financial surplus money profits which are tethered [936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=936.079s)

to energy which are tethered to hydrocarbons and we can't stop or slow down because the system requires growth to continue and to pay off the financial claims from the past and so what we're doing is we're kicking the can with various rule changes uh with debt etc and we have to continue to grow but the growth is tethered to energy and the only way that we're continuing this right now is by central banks and governments blowing up their balance sheets in order to keep goods and services flowing to large populations so what has happened is [977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=977.12s)

the market or the downward causation of a higher level system than than human individuals um is imposing rules on our behavior that are out of our control and so we are de facto the human species right now is functioning as an energy hungry [[superorganism]] it's it's it's not like a hive mind like the borg it's that we as individuals are [1005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1005.519s)

individual cells of a larger entity that is compelled to grow and and you brought up the word energy blind most people think that technology is what drives the human progress machine and it's really the combination of technology and energy that has brought us to this point but technology is dependent on energy so [1029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1029.839s)

one day when we don't have this amount of cheap energy at scale technology is going to play a much different role yeah i think all the really important points are touched on there and i just want to take this time and unpack them i'll kind of start from the beginning um we could say that this is a kind of [1050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1050.08s)

thermodynamic perspective that is focused on uh the fact that for an evolutionary perspective to exist the traits that are going to get selected for involve in animal moving uh involve you know some kind of metabolic process it and the core to all of that is the ability to harvest energy from the environment one of the deepest [1071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1071.44s)

definitions of life is actually an entropy pump something that can take more energy from the environment and externalize its entropy and so then you're looking at the way that human technology starting with stone tools and then agricultural tech and then industrial tech allowed us to harvest more energy from our environment than other animals to be [1089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1089.679s)

able to do future surplus stuff and then to be able to compete with others over the future surplus and grow populations faster and how how fundamental of a kind of defining characteristic this thermodynamic combined with competitive or like it's a thermodynamic and then evolutionary theory together where the tech ends up evolving our [1111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1111.52s)

capacity to extract energy and use energy for more stuff which increases our kind of ability to win at wars and economic wars and whatever else driving an [[arms race]] of the ability to extract external eyes etc faster driving ultimately fragility of the planet at large i don't think we've ever talked about this but have you heard of the fourth [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1133.2s)

law of thermodynamics loosely defined called the maximum power principle please explain it so in nature organisms and ecosystems that self-organize around capturing energy surplus as i said earlier have an evolutionary advantage so if you if they they've taken aerial views over [1154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1154.88s)

a forest transect and the hottest uh uh place is the the road where nothing's growing the coolest place is where an old growth redwood tree is growing because it's dissipating more energy so in nature those those um ecosystems that are able to capture more energy have an advantage and it it ends [1178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1178.559s)

up resulting in a scaling law called klieber's law which is that animals energy use scales to the three-quarter power of their size and this works for mice all the way up to blue whales and so the size of the organism show dictates how much energy it uses well lo and behold if you aggregate all the countries in the earth [1204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1204.32s)

the the slope of global gdp is right around the the size of the gdp to the two-thirds power it's not exactly the same but the relationship holds even as a biological organism the whole human economy yeah so you mentioned uh initially two types of surplus and extraction both of which [1228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1228.72s)

were hydrocarbon the first one being grain with the advent of the plow and baskets kind of early agricultural revolution the second being oil and coal hydrocarbons that time i think it is kind of interesting that they are both calories they're both measures of energy they're both hydrocarbons they're both uh sun impounded by plants turned into hydrocarbons as doors of energy um and one of them is being generated every season or kind of in real time the agricultural one the other one is from you know tens or hundreds of millions of years of storage um but they're both about developing more technology one case the plow the second case like the oil drill and refinery to be able to extract stored sunlight yeah i can i call it current sunlight which is crops old sunlight which is trees maybe you'll chop down a 100 year tree and then ancient sunlight which is tens to hundreds of millions of years [1288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1288.96s)

ago and you're right you can use technology to ex to access those pools of of potential energy so to go back to the agricultural revolution going from hunter gatherer to an agrarian culture and the plow you were mentioning the key thing being that grains were more storable than say what you could hunt and gather meats and [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1310.08s)

berries and stuff more storable means you can make it through the famine and grow the population faster and then if you grow the population faster you can win a tribal warfare and now you also have more stuff that is worth invading for another tribe so now you have to do defense and military and all the things that go along with having that surplus [1328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1328.0s)

and now for the first time the economics of needing to deal with surplus come about so private property ownership and inheritance and all those things it was like it was a big deal that particular um transition was when that was when our species ate the apple in the garden of eden it's interesting you know just if it's [1347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1347.12s)

not clear that was also kind of in one way the beginning of the anthropocene because before that you want nature to be pretty much the way it is to hunt and gather from this the first time you want to start clear cutting an area to turn it into agriculture land for lots of grain because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got to row crop it to then be [1366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1366.0s)

able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the anthropocene and the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together yeah no that's right and what also happened um is that's when inequality really started to occur we were always in equal in terms of [1386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1386.32s)

status and uh respect and things like that but we were always incredibly equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around with us everyone's uh actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same but once we started soaring surplus that's when the uh the hierarchies um [1412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1412.799s)

started yeah the beginning of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the [[dunbar number]] which equaled how to domesticate wild-type humans that would have otherwise been dunbar tribal right and i bring that up because there is and we could talk about this another [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1432.32s)

time but just briefly there's a lot of um binary discussion about [[human nature]] and i strongly believe that one of the [[generator function|generator functions]] of civilization is who we are as evolved organisms in our evolutionary psychology and we are incredibly plastic and our cultural plasticity is even greater than our individual plasticity [1457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1457.84s)

but to say that that humans are this way there's thousands of examples of how cultures and humans lived in the past and we just look around us and think this is how humans are and it's we're living an anomaly with this massive massive amount of exosomatic energy and and before i um forget to say the point exosomatic energy is energy that we [1482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1482.799s)

consume but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average american consumes like 2500 calories outside the body the average american consumes over 200 000 kilocalories per day um in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc [1506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1506.159s)

so we're the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons um so i i can get back to that but it's it's just we we completely are blind [1528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1528.799s)

to the fact that our current global culture uses five a 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents worth of coal oil and and gas we use around 30 billion barrels uh um of oil um and and the rest is is coal and natural gas but that works out to at five five years per barrel that means we have a global labor force [1557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1557.039s)

of 500 billion human equivalents relative to 5 billion real human workers excluding children and and old people so we have like a hundred to one armies of fossil workers standing behind us and the [[economic system]] only treats their value as the cost of extracting them from the earth and so economics textbooks have [1581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1581.6s)

completely missed this and economists aren't dumb they just told the wrong story as we were going up this this moonshot of growth that we've had this last century they have all kinds of complicated formulas that explain it most of the story is now capital and labor that we apply those two [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1605.36s)

factors to our economy and then this resulting riches and progress and and productivity when the reality is a good deal of that can be described by this additional uh labor that is in the form of fossil carbon and hydrocarbons which is energy so it's easy to see once we have oil that is running um industrial engines and the tractor [1631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1631.44s)

replaces the plow and the uh and the automated um or the industrial mill replaces you know kind of human labor we can see the labor there but if we go back to the earliest examples of what you're calling extrasomatic or extracorporeal energy [1649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1649.2s)

um there's the storage for human consumption which was the grain but then there's also the usage of it for things other than just human caloric consumption but that are part of our life and you can see that going all the way back arguably to um harvesting fire right like that that you [1665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1665.919s)

could kind of see that as the beginning of starting to use energy probably mostly in the form of wood drive entropy to meet human needs in a way that was totally different than the rest of the animal kingdom and so if we to just kind of finish out that early part of the story [1683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1683.6s)

before hunter gather ended with um kind of agrarian or before the agrarian mark of being able to do um agriculture store grains there was uh the stone weapons and the fire going all the way back to pre-sapien right homo habilis kind of time where the stone weapons meant that we could hunt we increased our predatory capacity relative to the animals faster than they could evolve increasing their capacity to evade it in a way that didn't happen for any other animal because they weren't evolving their tools they were just evolving physically and there's a cemetery of that evolution so we were able to move from we were able to overhunt an environment [1724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1724.96s)

and then rather than have our population get checked move to the next place and overhunt that one so even in that long hunter gatherer time and burn stuff up for the usefulness of fire um to make cold environments hospitable to us and food that wouldn't have been so you can see we kind of started doing that with the beginning of like fire and stone [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1744.559s)

tools then we did it way more with agriculture then we did it way more with industrial and then way more again with kind of information and but they're all steps in that same store absolutely absolutely we are uh an innovative creative curious problem solving can kicking species but the big two movements were the agricultural access of grain and storing [1765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1765.6s)

it we had been a couple million individuals and down to a hundred thousand individuals many times over the last several hundred thousand years and then agriculture within a a few millennium we were 200 million and uh now we're uh sometime next year we'll cross eight billion um but if you think about the oil story becomes so big which is where you're going to emphasize is because before oil we were half a billion people that's right right and we went from half a billion to eight billion in like that much time because of the [[industrial revolution]] so 10 000 years ago um animals mammals relative to humans we're like 99 of the biomass now humans in our livestock if you weigh all of us we're 98 of the mammalian biomass on the planet but if you look back now versus 10 000 years ago the amount of total animal biomass on the planet today is 700 percent what it was 10 000 years ago how can that be because we've added that enormous bolus of fossil productivity to the [[food supply]] so the agricultural revolution was when we used technology to use the haber bosch process to take natural gas and create ammonia fertilizer which added nitrogen to the fields sixty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas [1872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1872.08s)

so we've massively boosted the [[food supply]] directly from fossil carbon and hydrocarbons so not only did we originally gain extra storable calories hydrocarbon with grain and then we started getting extra hydrocarbons in the form of oil we use [1893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1893.679s)

the oil ones to be able to increase the manufacture of grain and other agriculture products by orders of magnitude yes and there's there's a common uh stat out there that's actually slightly incorrect but for most of our history our [1910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1910.399s)

agricultural system was a net energy producer we would spend a certain amount of calories with our muscles and our animals and we would get more calories than that back but now our our food system is a massive energy sink we spend 10 to 14 calories for every calorie that we produce [1934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1934.559s)

um the the misnomer is that 10 calories of fossil fuels are added to get one calorie of food the truth is it's like two calories of fossil but then the the 10 to 14 comes from the processing the packaging the delivering the cooking so our entire food system uses 10 times the energy that it it produces in in you know full full cycle and this is due to [1965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1965.679s)

oil and natural gas and we just look at the end product and don't think about the full system that created it so when we talk when you're mentioning that the energy is pretty pegged to the economy that the total gdp of the world and total energy use are pretty closely correlated [1987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=1987.039s)

um because lots of things that we make out of one material we could make out of another material there's a lot of different conductors and insulators and whatever but they all require energy that's pretty fundamental and that whether we're moving that value in the economy is moving atoms around in the physical world or [2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2007.2s)

bits around in the virtual world both of those require energy um this seems to be also very fundamental to where you're going in terms of the viability of the economy that the [[embedded growth obligation]] is in the economy but that creates an [[embedded growth obligation]] the extraction of energy and we're getting to diminishing returns on [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2025.36s)

the earth's stored ability to keep giving that and that that's really fundamental to what the near-term future portends can you impact that a little bit yes uh lots of things to say there so no matter how you make a cup whether it's a coconut or gold or ceramic or glass or aluminum you need energy no matter what so you can get better and you can get more efficient over time music but energy is required for any any process so over uh the last well before 1970 the the relationship was almost one for one every time we grew our gdp we grew our energy use at around the same percent [2069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2069.359s)

then we started to get efficient in the 1970s and for instance we were a lot of places were using oil in power plants and burning natural gas is much more efficient we started to get used coal in a smarter way we started to do new inventions that would use a little bit less energy to get the same product so in the last 50 years we there's two trends there's gdp has been growing and energy use grows almost the same rate but at around 99 so on average we get one percent more efficient and that matters after 50 years you you're using 50 percent less energy than you were 50 [2113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2113.76s)

years ago but no matter what next year if you have a factory where you make a hundred thousand cars and you decide to expand your your business and you want to make 200 000 cars you're going to use almost twice as much energy so de facto they're incredibly linked but here's where um there's a couple of um of [2134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2134.88s)

misunderstandings some countries have decoupled their economic output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of gdp which is how much energy we need to generate a dollar of gdp the united states the united kingdom are service-based economies [2159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2159.599s)

so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating gdp by using less energy but the the important thing from the [[superorganism]] vantage point which is our future sustainability our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2184.64s)

percent because the united states and the united kingdom um in in america the average american consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per but we import another 17 or so from china in we don't import the oil from china we import the televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the [2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2210.56s)

energy was burned in china we paid dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive footprint but the bottom line is that um globally energy and gdp are tightly linked one other caveat i would say there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this is [2235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2235.68s)

an artifact of this massive uh off in the financial markets due to central banks because of the way that pension funds are treated in the gdp calculations and when and if i would say if or i would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up around the the 99 plus percent okay so that second point [2261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2261.28s)

equals i would just call it financial manipulation where you can make more dollars that are not actually indexing more goods and services and that'll end up recorrecting but insofar as the dollars are indexing goods and services you're going to get a pretty tight correlation i want to come back to and it's important because sometimes people will see a financial manipulation and treat it as if they're decoupling and then change our forecasts of energy viability and you're like no not really you're kind of missing the point here so i think that's really important i want to underscore it but i want to come back to the nations one for a moment because [2297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2297.839s)

what you're saying is okay so this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem like it has higher gdp relative to its own domestic energy use but it's  because it's just exporting all of its like really high energy intensive stuff to the [2318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2318.8s)

manufacturing that's happening somewhere else it then imports the products of and i find this like i find this for so many things you can take a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good genie coefficient your economic inequality [2336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2336.8s)

that's needed to make your civilization run is still very high because you just buy your from cheap labor from somewhere else yeah well this gets to your whole objective of your work is is [[sensemaking]] and uh and information because on all these issues you can draw your boundaries somewhere and come up with an answer and [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2357.52s)

what humanity needs is wide boundary thinking we need to look at the larger boundaries because then we know what what doors are shut and which ones remain open so yeah we need to look at the wider boundary this is why i think your [[superorganism]] perspective is really important because of course you can have a what looks like a local improvement in one [2377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2377.2s)

area it actually is and now it's cool we should understand that as a prototype but oftentimes it's not really a local improvement it's just externalizing the harm somewhere else and then measuring inside of a of a boundary something that crossed the boundary and so this is where we have to say okay for the [[superorganism]] as a whole that the countries that have to do the agriculture and the manufacturing and the cheap labor and the whatever now let's look at the metrics and say for a civilization that depends upon the whole thing because the countries don't depend on themselves they depend on six continent global [[supply chain|supply chains]] and they depend on the commons of the oceans and all like that so we really [2411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2411.28s)

have to look at the [[superorganism]] writ large to really make any sense of it that doesn't involve externality so i if people haven't read your paper um on on [[superorganism]] issue i think it's fundamental but i want to come back to this other thing that you were saying about increases in efficiency that energy does get slightly more efficient [2431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2431.44s)

can you explain the jevin's paradox to people for for people who aren't familiar with it because it seems like a lot of people have hope that we're gonna solve the energy issue by increases in efficiency so um william stavan stanley jevins was a 19th [2450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2450.319s)

century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive beneficial invention of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient that's [2477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2477.68s)

because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened so today um i i think this let me first sidetrack and and talk about um the two types of technology um so first of all technology is [2498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2498.48s)

deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like flat screen tvs will get cheaper and cheaper until they asymptotically you just can't get them any cheaper but so tech is deflationary [2517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2517.92s)

counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not there yet so these two forces between technological deflation and resource input inflation are are [2541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2541.92s)

battling so when we think about technology there's really two categories of technology the first tech the first category is ways to make our energy use our energy capture more efficient for example we can develop new solar voltaic cells that are more [2563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2563.52s)

efficient or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out of that the second type of technology is inventing uh new ways uh or or ways that humans use energy that we used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that [2590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2590.56s)

second category of technology that dominates our our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevin's paradox means that if something gets more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2618.319s)

on that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends up happening is efficiency is in service of the [[superorganism]] to a large extent so efficiency as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh corporations and and businesses optimize profits via gdp [2642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2642.8s)

efficiency will just feed more money into that system in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future did that make sense yeah i want to go a little bit deeper here because i think people really having an intuition for this paradox is so important the idea that there's stuff that we do that [2662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2662.88s)

mediates our current quality of life and we can make it more efficient like it seems like that is a way to be able to have less impact on the planet we can do  more efficiently so we can use less stuff and still have the same quality of life except that's never what happens right did you have that would be true if the scale was capped [2680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2680.16s)

right and so the jeffers paradox says you were kind of mentioning from the demand side people buy more at walmart but also from the supply side there are certain products and services that are just not profitable to make yet but if i drop the price of energy enough is one of the inputs whole new market sectors open up [2697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2697.119s)

there's whole new businesses and industries that can now be profitable and uh so this what you're calling the fourth law of thermodynamics it's almost like an evolutionary theory um uh the idea that any niche that exists will get filled if there is some energy to [2714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2714.319s)

extract in a place something will evolve to extract that energy and we're saying now faster than biology can evolve to do it humans will innovate to do it we will innovate how to extract the extra energy into place and so anytime you get an increase in efficiency you get a whole new uh profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up [2736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2736.319s)

going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable doesn't work as long as there is an ins either an [[embedded growth obligation]] or an incentive around net growth exactly now there potentially could be [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2755.2s)

ways around that if you had a jevin's paradox dividend or something like that where you had an invention and you created all this uh efficiency gains which were monetized but you had a rule that that bolus of new capital that came from efficiency was um [2779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2779.839s)

was devoted to some process or some future outside of the [[superorganism]] like building a local uh ecological watershed with renewable energy or something that was full cycle then you could short circuit the uh the the efficiency the rebound effect of the efficiency profits going into the global monetary energy hungry [[superorganism]] so the thing that you're saying right now is so consequential people get it because you're saying we have to go to a post-growth [[economic system]] that as long as the economy and dollars are coupled at all whether it's one for one or 99 or 80 percent even if there's efficiency if they're coupled at all an [[exponential growth]] capital system there there just aren't an exponentially more amount of hydrocarbons and so you and we're already at the point diminishing return on the quality of hydrocarbons fracking is shittier oil than the first oil was right it's harder to get into after fracking there's nothing that's the source rock there's nothing left after that but go [2848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2848.4s)

on so we're at this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the [2868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2868.319s)

how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to access energy so have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great [2885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2885.28s)

reckoning so this is what you call it there's not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning which i'm referring to as the great simplification and yes eventually by definition [2906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2906.4s)

we will have to have a post-growth economy if just increased efficiency isn't the answer because of the jeven's paradox what about just move to renewables why is that not good enough we replace all the hydrocarbons with solar and wind in geothermal that's a whole to our podcast on its own but let me give you some of the the high points as if you you often use this [2927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2927.2s)

phraseology the difference between potential and kinetic energy potential energy is unbelievably powerful because it's sitting there untapped and you can move it especially oil oil is akin to hemoglobin in our arteries and veins of our global system because it's liquid at room temperature and we can move oil everywhere which is much different than [2950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2950.8s)

wood or or coal or human muscle for that matter at that scale meaning soil can go through pipelines a lot faster than coal can go over railroads exactly exactly um and uh its oil is incredibly energy dense which is the amount of energy you get per unit volume or unit mass [2973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2973.04s)

um renewables are like um you have to buy go to the grocery store and buy a bunch of ingredients to create a meal whereas the fossil hydrocarbons the meal is already created so that's a little bit of the difference between kinetic and potential the energy return is huge [2995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=2995.2s)

from the scale of the industrial infrastructure that's been built if you think about it we have 500 billion human worker equivalents in the form of fossil hydrocarbons and so we can't just say those are going to go away and then replace it with renewables first of all we need those fossil hydrocarbons to build the renewables and [3017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3017.119s)

renewables is not even a good term right because an oak tree is renewable uh if there's an acorn one of my chickens is renewable as long as the rooster uh it has a fertilized egg with the hen but renewables um like require rebar steel and complicated uh clean rooms to make the silicone wafers and and things like that at best they're [3044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3044.72s)

rebuildable because every 20 years or so we need to rebuild them what they do is they they are rebuildable machines that can harness the renewable flows of the sun and the wind but from the [[superorganism]] vantage point we are optimizing growth and growth requires more energy whether it's fossil hydrocarbons or renewables or some [3069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3069.76s)

combination so from 2000 in 2019 we grew the amount of electricity demand in the world of all kinds that just the amount of growth and electricity demand was more than all of the solar voltaic power generation capacity built since the dawn of time so so far [3096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3096.4s)

all the renewables are growing very rapidly especially in the last year but the the the amount of fossil fuels underpinning our society is around the same as it's been 50 years ago which is 83 percent so we're just growing a bigger system we went we switched from wood to hydro to coal and eventually [3119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3119.359s)

oil and gas 150 years ago even now today we are now using more wood for human fuel etc than we were 150 years ago so we we keep adding more energy to the system so renewables i am in favor of renewables um but the the current stories that are being told are that we're going to continue to grow by plug and playing renewable technology for fossil fuels that's not going to happen so i think renewables can power a great civilization it's just going to look very different than the one we have now my understanding is that there's three primary reasons that the current [3161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3161.76s)

renewable tech path is insufficient uh one is this topic of the hydrocarbon energy it takes to make the solar cell in the batteries the energy return on energy investment calculus is not good and i want you to get into that the next is that the energy quality is not comparable whether we're talking energy density or [3184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3184.8s)

transportability and the third is that there's stuff we do with hydrocarbons that isn't just energy that is hard to replace in terms of chemistry and manufacturing and so when we start thinking about getting off of oil and coal we have to think about each of those factors so can you [3204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3204.559s)

get in and if there are more please let me know those seem like the primary ones and so it's like if if we have diminishing return on hydrocarbons and we need them for manufacturing ongoingly then we have to get off of oil even before we run out of it for energy so the amount of so we and if we're going to try to replace our current energy [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3223.839s)

including the [[exponential growth]] of the energy with renewables or rebuildables we just don't have what it takes to do that yet because uh since they're not easily transportable we'd have to build them everywhere what it takes to do that requires more hydrocarbons now to build [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3240.48s)

all of that okay so just like a a cheetah chasing a gazelle there's an energy payoff there all of our current energy technologies have an energy input versus an energy output and historically we would get a hundred to one ratio from oil we would invest one barrel of oil to find uh a hundred sort of things um that went down to like it's not obvious for anyone who's not not used to thinking about industrial capacity to drill oil requires running a machine that runs on oil so you've got to use some oil to get the oil and now what we're talking about is using some oil to make the solar cells which means mining the material and [3284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3284.4s)

manufacturing and building the batteries and all that stuff right and there is no way right now of using purely electricity to go deep into mines um we it's diesel fuel and machines so um yeah there's so much to unpack here daniel so [3302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3302.319s)

first of all the energy return on renewables is viable there it's it's a decent energy return let's let's take some of the recent optimistic reports that say that solar and wind are 12 to 1 return and let's take the depleting uh coal is an eight to one return so there's a lot of what those numbers mean well that means that um if you take the life of a solar music panel and you use life cycle analysis that people say and this gets back to that boundary question where do you draw the boundaries this is [3346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3346.72s)

what i wrote my phd thesis on back in the day but um that you will generate 10 times more energy during the lifetime of a solar photovoltaic layout than the energy that went into it so that's a pretty good deal not as good as oil but but pretty good um now coal um is bulky and dirty and uh but you just throw it in a in a power plant and you burn it and it generates electricity so the story that is the optimistic renewable story is that on the surface [3383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3383.839s)

um renewables have a higher eroi than energy returned than than for example coal but what they're not taking into account is the full system cost of the energy because the wind doesn't always blow as is evidenced the last uh six months in germany which is one of the reasons that natural uh the electricity prices are so [3408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3408.079s)

high because their wind basically didn't blow for a month um so if you handicap for intermittence and variability the full system eroi or energy return on those renewable systems is down to like four to one and our [[economic system]] couldn't function at a four to one return now there this is a really deep conversation [3432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3432.64s)

but we could overbuild wind and solar and use the extra when it's really windy or really sunny we generate way too much that that we don't need and we put that into uh electrolysis and create ammonia or or use that for other uh other economic products so we could boost it back up to five to one or maybe [3457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3457.839s)

six to one but full system cost fossil fuels are completed meals and we can't replace that with renewables just to make sure that's clear for everyone one way of thinking about that is that because of the intermittence you don't have that with oil or coal because you have the oil stored on site and you can just burn more of it or the [3479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3479.599s)

coal stored on site you can burn more as demand goes up in real time and so it is a storage mechanism it's its own battery right it's already stored energy well it gets back to the cell has to also have the batteries and so now we're looking at the photovoltaic cell the batteries you know in that whole storage creation and distribution system so natural gas is [3500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3500.16s)

the perfect fuel for for power plants because no matter what happens you just flick a switch and you burn it and whether it's windy or sunny or in the middle of the night or the middle of the day whereas these other fuels have um you know bells and whistles that are required and if you want to make sure that the grid is on [3518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3518.88s)

um natural gas is like the perfect feel for that of course there are there are emissions that come from it and that's one of the other stories embedded here but let me tell you another big problem with renewables is that around 20 of our energy use globally is electricity [3541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3541.839s)

and the vast majority of renewable technology is used to generate electricity there are tons of ways that humans use energy that can't easily be easily be replaced by by renewables generating electricity for example the [3560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3560.96s)

big bunker fuel ships that carry things around the ocean you know liquid fuels heating things like that can't some of those things can be replaced but at a cost and remember the whole uh dynamic underpinning industrialization was this giant trade that we did kind of a faustian bargain in [3584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3584.88s)

retrospect where we replaced things that humans used to do by adding thousands of units of energy more than the humans did and because it was nearly free that was horribly energy inefficient because we used tons more energy but it was incredibly economically efficient so when we started that trade 200 years [3610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3610.4s)

ago by adding huge amounts of energy to processes that humans used to do manually that raised our wages it raised our profits it reduced the price of stuff and it ended up being growing with more people so from the year 1500 to now if you uh take the number of people and multiply that by the average goods and services per person the human economy is a thousand times bigger than it was 500 years ago because of this adding energy to technology to grow the system now you you might you of all people probably you the only people that would say this is it is true back in the day there were things that we enjoyed in our lives a few hundred years ago that weren't counted by goods and services in the [[economic system]] so is it really a thousand times bigger yeah there could be some wiggle room there that we bartered and things like that that were not included in the economic in the [[economic system]] but by and large it's it's three orders of [3678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3678.319s)

magnitude the the scale difference so you're starting to mention uh that there are emissions associated with the natural gas that would otherwise be uh perfect if there was an unlimited amount of it so probably the the central environmental story of the [3695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3695.76s)

world today's [[climate change]] and uh [[climate change]] from you know anthropogenic greenhouse gases which is not only co2 it's methane and some other things but mostly it's a co2 story so that's the other side of the energy story that you're talking about is the co2 comes from burning those hydrocarbons right [3716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3716.799s)

and so the excessive co2 equals changes in planetary biosphere and so everybody's very focused on the uh need to reduce carbon consumption because of not wanting all the co2 you're talking about this whole other side which is we're actually running out of the hydrocarbon stores also of course there's massive environmental impact on the front side [3738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3738.48s)

of the [[materials economy]] whether we're talking about mountaintop removal mining to get the coal or we're talking about oil spills associated with getting the oil or we're talking about wars over oil in a hole like geopolitically tense system based over where the oil distribution is that that hydrocarbon system has environmental harm on the extraction plus environmental harm on the waste that's associated but neither of those are factored into the cost of the oil which is your point that when we're paying for the barrel of oil we're paying whatever it costs some oil company it what what does it cost them to get it [3777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3777.039s)

out of the ground plus whatever margin they put on top of it which does not include what it would take to make more hydrocarbons or to deal with the environmental impact or certainly to deal with the wars in geopolitical destabilization as a result of the um you know location of it so this topic of why the cost of extraction is core to what's wrong with economic [3800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3800.72s)

theory can you unpack that a little bit more yeah so um we have uh underpaid for the main resource input to our economies for over a century and we've not paid for the cost of the pollution at all so the prices of everything are are wrong but they're not wrong from a sense of [3824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3824.88s)

maximum power that we're trying to get the evolutionary uh emotional states of our ancestors in the cheapest way possible to the most amount of people that's what our [[economic system]] is doing right now the problem is and you know this very well is a lot of our you you call it our attention seconds or uh how we get dopamine and these other things is mostly by frivolous means that don't give us long-term meaning or whatever so we're de facto turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight into microliters of of dopamine and calling that an economic success but there's basically two broad categories of environmental impact [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3868.0s)

one is as you point out the metabolism downstream of human energy use my friend tim garrett has a chart showing gdps since the 1940s and co2 in monoloa and they are like in one for one tract so you can look at the co2 in the atmosphere and without knowing anything about the size of our economy you can interpolate the size of our economy from that so we are functioning as a heat engine and the oceans and the atmosphere are absorbing this excess co2 the other big environmental category is what we do with the energy uh and that would be mountaintop removal or uh killing elephants for ivory or [3914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3914.16s)

uh overfishing the oceans or or those two things neither of those categories are do we pay for in the prices of things part of that is a is a metabolic uh um equation and part of it is a value equation of what humans care about and and and what we want to include but our prices do not include the negative externalities if you were to include daniel the negative externalities full wide boundary of our energy use there would not be a single industry on the planet earth that would be profitable because the the for instance um there was a paper written that shows the full cost of coal if you include [3961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3961.44s)

climate and other things and it was like 18 to 20 cents a kilowatt hour when we actually only pay for four cents so if you were to include all the negative externalities in our prices our [[economic system]] would be much smaller and i think one way out of this i personally have decided we are not going to [3989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=3989.119s)

voluntarily degrow it will never happen there's too much momentum in the system there's too much inertia to you know political geopolitical i mean look at what's happened with with covid and the pandemic we have to print money and bail people out to keep the economy going we're not going to [4011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4011.039s)

voluntarily shrink but i think we will eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and things like that and so this gets to your original premise i think we have to anticipate what might happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories of the x-risk that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward towards a saner [4056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4056.24s)

longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that is get the prices right on the main input to our economies if we were able to not only carbon but all non-renewable inputs have a tax on anything that's non-renewable on human time scale so that would be natural gas or copper or fossil water aquifers or sand or anything like that um and then simultaneously remove tax on humans 95 of our taxes right now are on human labor so if we removed all those you make 50 000 a year you keep your 50 000 you don't have to pay any taxes but if you bought an iphone which has all kinds of uh complicated expensive machinery uh metals and and minerals in there it might cost two or three thousand dollars relative to five hundred dollars today so if we had the prices right we would be better able to innovate in a way that is um aligned with our future and we would [4126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4126.799s)

probably conserve we wouldn't just um fly to the bahamas on a junket or vegas or or just buy from amazon every day to give us a little bit more dopamine so i do think changing the prices is is one avenue but there's one one area that i think we skipped over that i think is important um is the material side so i talked about the the linkage [4151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4151.359s)

between energy and growth there's also a linkage between material or atoms uh and growth so for the last 50 years that relationship has almost been entirely one for one so every dollar of gdp requires about two pounds of non-renewable materials so that if the [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4174.4s)

an american baby born today will be expected to use 3.1 million pounds of non-renewable materials in his or her lifetime extrapolating the past forward so this energy it's not just energy it's energy combined with materials to develop technology so even if we had abundant energy there would be material [4199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4199.679s)

limits on earth with many of the especially look at what's going on right now with lithium and and some of the inputs to electric cars and by the way i will i will tell our listeners right now that um because of our your busy schedule it is 9 05 p.m right now when we're recording [4221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4221.199s)

this so i i might be getting a little uh slap happy with my comments but here's another problem with renewals daniel every barrel of oil and and natural gas is not just used for gasoline gasoline is only 40 of a barrel of oil the rest of it is heating oil and diesel and fractions that get converted into naphtha and asphalt and tar and 6000 [4248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4248.88s)

other products like aspirin and football helmets and plastics and fertilizers and condoms and tents and it's it's unbelievable how many products are made from these fossil hydrocarbons so if we were just conceptually able to replace all the internal combustion cars on the planet with electric cars in order to save [[climate change]] it wouldn't really it wouldn't reduce our demand for oil at all it would reduce our demand for gasoline but we would still have all the other products the 60 of the barrel of the oil that we would have an [[economic system]] and requirement for so what would we do with the gasoline then [4299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4299.36s)

flare it or dump it in a river yes we could at some cost change the refineries to use some of that and divert it towards those other products but not all of it so that that's also something that gets glossed over in this this massive uh shift towards electric cars so you mentioned mining a couple times [4320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4320.32s)

and that uh getting electricity uh down to the mining is pretty difficult that that's done in stored forms of energy like diesel and whatever um and that you were mentioning that there is a correlation of energy in dollars but also a correlation of material in dollars from the point of view of waste i think when most people who haven't [4344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4344.159s)

studied the topic well think about waste they think about what they put in trash at their house the municipal solid waste and they don't think about the total waste coming out of industry and just even mining right like just the toxic tailings coming out of the fact that the nice metals in all the things that we use were a part of a rock and ore where most of that was useless but [4362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4362.719s)

actually pretty toxic by the time you smelt it you get you know tens or hundreds of parts of useless toxic mining tailings for each part of the thing that is useful and those just go in these massive not landfills but dumps to then every once in a while break and go into rivers and oceans and mess things up at scale [4380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4380.56s)

when people start to understand the waste management issue writ large of which co2 going into the air and ocean is one tiny little thing which is all of [[climate change]] and it's literally a tiny little thing and micro plastics going into the ocean is a tiny little thing when people start to think about that our [[materials economy]] is depleting unrenewably from the earth on one side [4400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4400.32s)

and turning it into waste on the other side and all the [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] the result of that and the whole thing is using energy and renewably right so we're using atoms unrenewably moving them by energy and renewably we have to move to a closed-loop [[economic system]] where the new stuff is made out of the old stuff we don't require an exponential amount [4416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4416.96s)

more stuff and all of it is on renewable or rebuildable energy the transition from here to there is fundamental and it requires a totally new [[economic system]] because it can't be based on the same type of [[embedded growth obligation]] and there's the huge question of what does that new system look like and then also how [4434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4434.96s)

do we get there from here with the [[embedded growth obligation|embedded growth obligations]] and the competitions in the system because if we try to create a tax nationally and some other country doesn't they benefit relative to us in terms of their extraction capability which will end up meaning geopolitical and military capability which means everyone says [4453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4453.84s)

it and it's just a [[race to the bottom]] so when you i mean first i just want to say because you're a teacher you probably have already done this almost nobody has a sense of like the computer that i'm talking on right now what it took from a [[supply chain]] perspective to make this thing [4468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4468.0s)

like what i think every high school class should be every high school should have a class that is what does it take to make one of these cell phones from the oil to make the plastics to the materials refinement and the uh the lithography to make the chips no single human being knows how to make it it's it's a collection of [4487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4487.92s)

processes and components uh it's pretty much could you imagine a thousand years ago you're just showing up with one of these things they would have thought it was magic absolutely taiwan has come into the center of public news recently and tsmc because of the you know uh south china sea's issue but the fact [4508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4508.64s)

that we are so dependent on taiwan because making computer ships is so goddamn hard the u.s has not been able to do it to be able to like reduce its dependence on taiwan you get a sense of like the manufacturing that we take for granted is mind-bogglingly complex and you know and it really is like six continents worth of [[supply chain|supply chains]] to make anything and that's why um i am an advocate for continuing um open-ended globalization for luxury things and things like that but for very key ingredients and and key things like food and shoes and pharmaceutical inputs how long can we have these six continent [4556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4556.159s)

[[supply chain|supply chains]] can we have more regional local [[supply chain|supply chains]] for some things the market is giving us the signal because of the financial response to the pandemic that you know globalization and profits and everything will continue forward but i i do think that's a big risk getting back to your your point uh your question i have a couple of uh asterisks [4580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4580.239s)

there first of all right now um yes on the global level we recycle around nine percent of the material input and that's actually gotten worse rather than better and ultimately yes we have to have a closed or more closed loop system but how could that evolve because i think a a system away from economic growth and [4605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4605.84s)

like you say there's no way that in a system right now that requires debt and central bank support and rule changes and deficit spending by governments they're not going to add a big tax on on renewable uh non-renewable inputs right now because that would hurt the system so i think we have to anticipate [4629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4629.6s)

and this is what i'm working with our colleague uh dick gephardt on the concept of advanced policy which is interventions and plans and blueprints that our society are going to need in the next decade but that are politically or socially impossible to happen now to do the [4650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4650.48s)

research and build constituency into them and one of them is this this untax project and we're we're doing research with imperial college in london i'm looking how this would actually manifest and it's really complicated one of the long shots but one of the trajectories and and destinations we should go for is [4673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4673.36s)

let's pay the right prices for the long term to spur innovation in the right direction of the real futures we're facing and we're just underpaying for all these things which said differently is we're over consuming uh based on the long-term viability of of this stuff which is a one-time [4696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4696.08s)

endowment that we're burning through 10 million times faster than it was sequestered that is not a happy thing to say that as a culture we're going to have to consume less and we're going to have to have some sort of redistribution that accompanies that because attacks naturally would be uh regressive everyone is familiar with what it means [4715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4715.28s)

for the government to subsidize a corporation that's not profitable because it's critical what you're basically saying is the market as a whole is being subsidized by nature on a savings account that's about to run out and the entire market for the most part is mostly not profitable in a way that would be sustainable because of the total amount of costs that are being [4735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4735.52s)

externalized and as soon as we run out of the stored free cheap stuff and stop being able to handle the consequences of the pollution the cost of everything goes up so much that it forces a restructure of the market and what we think is profitable and possible by multiples to orders of magnitude but it currently is and that's the break [4756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4756.4s)

scenario well the break scenario is that the bend scenario is that we have a smaller economy and we change our cultural objectives away from gdb towards well-being and social capital and community and other things rather than gadgets the break scenario is that this all happens without planning without blueprints and airbags [4778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4778.96s)

and the global [[supply chain|supply chains]] and or the geopolitical uh kinetic warfare is the response to these sorts of crises well it seems like bend is us try to proactively avoid the break of fundamentally not being able to have energy keep up with dollars and if energy can't keep up with dollars [4801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4801.92s)

and we keep making fake dollars at a certain point the dollars will start to inflate so much and lose buying power that faith in them will be lost and whether it's speculation against them or a run on the banks or a downgrade of the bonds when you start losing the dollar's purchasing power then that can break a bunch of different ways it can look like shutdown of [[supply chain|supply chains]] it can look like wars over resources but they're all pretty ugly right so we are growing our monetary claims like this and the underlying energy and materials that we're going to need to turn those claims into real wealth is going like this so the delta between those two is widening by the year and the game is the [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4844.56s)

plan the way to keep the system going we're kicking the can and we're not planning for five or ten years from now when that recouples so how do you see being able to realistically do a proactive bend model factoring no effecting what it would take to come to [4867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4867.92s)

global agreement between the major players to do so because there is a disadvantage in the near term of anyone who bends relative to anyone who doesn't and so unless you can get all of the major players to do it nobody's going to do it this is why i'm talking to you daniel and and others this this is a really freaking serious moment uh for our [4890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4890.719s)

civilization for our nation for our culture i know the st the problems and the constraints very well i'm not as fluent in the answers i think the answers are a combination of top down that we have to have plans uh in place for this sort of a economic trajectory and bottom up that people start i have to start waking up realizing the time we're alive [4916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4916.639s)

how much energy we use what really matters in life if you ask a bunch of your friends what are the five best experiences of their life it's unlikely to be huge exosomatic energy use it's going to be something with their family or in nature or their friends and so we have to re-tether [4940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4940.32s)

how we uh measure success in our lives as individuals uh by more social capital and less tech heavy stuff to to to uh be pilots of of what's possible i don't think that's going to happen culture wide but it could happen with a good number of people that act as kind of a scout team [4962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4962.4s)

towards a different uh way of of humans using less energy so i think these things because of human behavior that we are not good as a culture at deferring the second marshmallow um i think we will largely sleepwalk into these moments which is why working with you and others [4986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=4986.159s)

i want to educate and inspire individual humans to maybe simplify first and beat the rush and act as examples in their community and their family and their neighborhood to start living differently in a way that we're going to probably have to live regardless of what we choose in the near [5007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5007.199s)

future so as we go back to what you referenced in the very beginning of the model that a civilization can be thought of in terms of its infrastructure its [[social structure|social structures]] and its [[superstructure]] the [[superstructure]] being how it defines what the good life is what is fundamentally desirable what uh what the ordinating values of it are uh culture is a way of talking about that you're saying right now hey we actually have to change and deepen culture as the basis of what we're orienting the whole society to i would like obviously you and i've talked about a number of these things then as we're [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5045.36s)

talking about like the the [[game theory]] between nations where none of them want to do the thing that is good long term that disadvantages them in the short term if everyone doesn't because then they lose to whoever wins in the short term and so you get these just up [[collective action]] problems these kind of [[race to the bottom]] scenarios so how do we solve those uh i think and yeah it's so complex mostly people find one part that makes sense give up on the rest hope that the market a place of ideas will solve it meaning that other people solve other parts they focus on their part but then how all the parts fit together how the whole works [5082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5082.0s)

nobody's really paying attention to and so there are people who are just like i'm just going to focus on making renewables better and hope that they get there in time and other people that are like i'm just going to focus on turning some waste streams into new materials or i'm just going to focus on some aspect of culture i think one of the places that you and i [5097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5097.12s)

identity identified shared agreement is that there is critical stuff in our technosphere in our infrastructure critical stuff in our [[social structure|social structures]] our economics governance law and in our [[superstructure]] our culture and our values that all need to evolve together and that they all inter-influence each other each of those can inter-influence [5115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5115.92s)

each other so it's not a solution it's a whole ecosystem of solutions that we have to work on but they all have to be informed by understanding the problems in the interconnection of the hole well enough that you don't advantage one part while externalizing the cost to the other areas so i think we got to do and i appreciate you being available late at night your time i think we got to do the beginning first part of this thing that is i found meaningful in your work and was valuable for me to make more central of the uh music [[embedded growth obligation]] and finance being coupled to diminishing returns in energy that are not easily overcomeable through the current renewable technologies and process or the efficiencies in process and that being a major thing that we have to deal with and that being um connected to so many other things i think we did a good job of starting that and maybe starting to get to [5170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5170.639s)

what some of the transition looks like some of the cultural parts some of the advanced policy parts can be our next conversation that sounds good let me queue up the next conversation um because i know you well enough as someone who deeply understands the human predicament and you also have what i refer to as wide boundary empathy [5194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5194.4s)

but you're also incredibly productive you're a good friend you do things for for people even if it means more of your time and you just seem really balanced to me so so one question how do you manage to hold all this [[existential risk]] and the depth of the implications of the conversation we just had in your head and still manage to defer the marshmallow and stay sane focus present and be a good human being to the people in your life because i think that is the whatever you do that that's a formula that a lot more people are are hopefully going to be able to find you have a couple minute summary of that and then we'll expand on that next next call [5240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5240.8s)

i read some of the books and watched so many of uh krishnamurti's lectures as a kid and one of the things you would see him almost getting frustrated with when you'd be talking to the audience so many times he's like let's really take this seriously he was fun he was looking at how do we live without conflict and kind [5256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5256.88s)

of what is the fundamental basis of conflict and can we overcome it especially as we're becoming a nuclear and then you know [[exponential tech]] empowered species where the conflict gets more consequential and wait why he's asking how can we take the seriousness because he knows that people are sitting there in the audience listening and then they go home and they [5273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5273.04s)

just completely forget because they got they got a mortgage to pay and they got you know children to tend to and they got joneses to compete with and they got whatever and it's like wait wait are we actually taking seriously the topics we're talking about because if we do we have to change our life to say it's like it's like the death star is about to take the planet out you're on the planet and you realize the death star is going to take the planet out and you're like we're we're going to um build a community garden and we're going to work on making a better school after school program with the pta like wait wait like that's all cool stuff but the death star is about to take the planet out like join the rebel alliance we gotta do something about this there's something to be able to like take the scope urgency magnitude of the thing seriously enough to be transformed by it and then it's easy to just go into existential angst and and either want to kill yourself or or just go into hedonism and as a [5332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5332.639s)

solution because hedonism is actually a reasonable response to nihilism right yeah we're all going to die so it let's have some fun but to be like that's just not an acceptable answer like i can i can die f failing trying but i can't not be applying myself to see if there is a way through and it does end up looking like threading a needle right it does the that quote in the book of romans something about the path to heaven is uh steep and narrow and the path to hell is white and many so i was just exposed might have been similar for you i was exposed to these [5369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5369.12s)

things young enough that all the other ways of living that don't ensure that living gets to keep happening for everybody just could it just seem nonsensical they couldn't even compute as a thing i could do no i feel the same way i feel now is a [5386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5386.0s)

time on this planet that being alive and being aware of these things we can make a difference and for me the things that keep me going are conversations like this i have six or seven people like you in my network and it's like a shot of adrenaline of social adrenaline when i talk to you that's what i want to try to scale is to make people aware of how the [5409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5409.36s)

big picture fits together we use a hundred times more energy than we need in america in europe it's 50 times more i mean this isn't a redline disaster we have to navigate a glide path that humanity and earth's ecosystems make it through this and for me is sharing this goal of an era with other humans is what makes me allows me to cope and be fired [5436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5436.239s)

up to to work on it the next day i remember when i was a kid there was this famous saying in activism i don't remember who it's a tribute to originally that if you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention and it's true like if you go to a [[factory farm]] or you go to a sweatshop or you go to a open pit mine or a landfill like you'd be pretty outraged [5458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5458.4s)

and then it's like how do you do your normal stuff in face of that and then at the same time i would read gibran or hawfez and and and the artist and the poet and the mystic would say if you aren't overwhelmed by the beauty of life you aren't paying attention and i was like how to hold both of those at the same time because it's only because life is beautiful that i'm outraged that it's not being respected but if i'm only outraged i'm not actually connected to what is deeper than the outrage which is the love of life that that other emotion is in relationship to so then it's like okay if i'm outraged [5493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5493.04s)

all the time i'm actually not honoring the thing itself and yet the outrage serves a function and so it's like how do i hold my connection to the beauty of life to just appreciate it right now because we might oh we might all get taken out by a super volcano or an asteroid or a carrington event tomorrow so how do we just like be [5510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5510.48s)

with the beauty of it now in a way that's honoring and have that motivate us working on how to ensure the highest quality of life for all life now and into perpetuity simultaneously like that that's part of the dialectic personally for me perhaps because i'm a little bit older than you um i think you do that better than i do i've been outraged for over 20 [5532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE&t=5532.32s)
