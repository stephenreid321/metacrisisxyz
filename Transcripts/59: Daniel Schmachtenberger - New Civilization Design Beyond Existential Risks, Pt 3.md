welcome back to part three of our three-part series with daniel smoked a burger on the [[generator function]] of [[existential risk|existential risks]] in this episode daniel shares his vision for a path towards a post [[existential risk]] future and the three key features of this new civilization design he also talks about why there is no place for incentives in such a world to get all the links and show notes from this episode go to [18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=18.81s)

future thinkers org slash 57 you can also find the first and second part of this interview there this episode is brought to you by quality at a premium a nootropic supplement that helps support mental performance and brain health it's specifically designed to promote focus support energy mental clarity mood memory and creativity uv and i have both used it in the past we really liked it [38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=38.67s)

and we actually met the founders and interviewed them on future thinkers and you can check out those interviews they're one of our favorites at future thinkers org slash daniel and future thinkers org slash jordan they've got a new formula up called qualia mind it's got more natural ingredients and you can get it at future thinkers org slash brain hack and you can get 10% off if [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=55.8s)

you use the code future alright let's get into the show welcome to future thinkers org a podcast about the evolution of technology society and consciousness i'm mike gilliland and i'm uv ivanova if you new to the show and you'd like a list of our top episodes and resources go to future thinkers dyer org slash start and if you like our podcast leave us a rating and a [79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=79.439s)

review on itunes and elsewhere it really helps others find the show and we really appreciate it i'm reading carl jung right now and he's talking about his experience of going to live with the pueblo indians and how it completely just blew apart his conception of what was natural and how the western world view is different from other worldviews and he noticed that they were so happy [103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=103.44s)

and serene and they felt themselves as one with their environment and they had this very special relationship with the sun and it was just it was very beautiful but at the same time he realized how they were very vulnerable to you know the invasion of the western civilization so if we create a new civilization operating system that is not oriented towards winning wars then [127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=127.319s)

how do we ensure that it doesn't get destroyed by those who are imagine there's a group of people that get a stronger theory of causation so they learn newton's physics and so now they can use calculus to plot a ballistic curve and make the cannon ball hit the right spot every time rather than the pendulum dowsing which is kind of a hit or miss that belief is going to catch on [147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=147.75s)

and that's why science really caught on took us out of the dark ages was because it led to better weapons and better agriculture tech and better like real  so it proliferated because it was proliferative if we increased our theory of causation that ends up catching on but if we could increase our theory of causation and our theory of choice and the relationship between them that would [168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=168.75s)

actually be the most adaptive especially in the presence of where a particular [[game theory|game theoretic]] model of choice with the extension of causation we have is definitely [[self-terminating]] definitely anti adaptive and so i know we've been on for a long time so there's really only one more thing that i want to share that kind of closes this set of concepts so remember we said that any source of [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=189.15s)

asymmetric advantage competitive advantage in a win-lose game will end up once it's deployed being figured out in utilized by everybody you just up the level of fancy and playing field so but we also said the indians you were just mentioning and many of the treasures we've mentioned lost win lose games we don't want to try and build something that's just going to lose at a win-lose [213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=213.239s)

game but we know that if it tries to win at win-lose games it's just still part of the same existential curve that we're on so it has to not lose at a win-lose game while also not seeking to win but do it so it's basically not playing the game but it is oriented about how not to lose this is a very important thing and so we can think about power the way we have traditionally thought of power is a [237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=237.87s)

power over or power against type dynamic a [[game theory|game theoretic]] win-lose dynamic and that that any agent that deploys a particular kind of power leads to other agents for you on how to deploy the same and other kinds of powered power keeps it anting up till we get to problems but we could think about another term we might call strength which is not the power to beat someone else but it's the [257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=257.16s)

ability to not be beat by someone else it's the ability to maintain our own sovereignty and our own coherence in the presence of outside forces and so we can talk about my power like can i go beat somebody up but my strength is can my body fend off viruses and can i fend off cancers and can i actually protect myself if i need to protect myself which is different than can i go beat other [280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=280.26s)

people up and now the power game is the game we actually have to cure power over dynamics mean rivalry sign amex mean when loose dynamics is the source of evil it's not that money is the source of evil it's that power over where i think my well-being is ante coupled to yours ends up being the source of evil and money's just very deep in the stack of power dynamics but statuses and [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=302.31s)

certain ways of relating to sex and the number of things are so we have to get rid of the power over dynamics but it doesn't mean that i can't develop strength that makes me anti fragile in the presence of rivalry and then i say well what kind of capacity can i developed it doesn't get weaponized by somebody else and used against me given that any asymmetric capacity i get can [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=323.789s)

be weaponized there's really only one and this is a really interesting thing if i make the adaptive capacity of they were trying to make a new civilization as a model and the new full-stack civilization new economics new governance new infrastructure new culture that has comprehensive loop closure right doesn't create [345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=345.389s)

accumulation or depletion doesn't have rivalrous games within it etc if i try to have some unique adaptive capacity via certain type of information tech the other world will see that information tekken is it for all kinds of purposes including against me where there's an incentive to do so and the same is true if i used military tech or if i use environmental extraction technology the [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=367.319s)

advantage of the way the civilization structured has to do with increased coherence in the [[sensemaking]] and choice making between all the agents in the system all the people in the system increase interpersonal coherence this cannot be weaponized and anyone else employing it is now just a system itself propagating so for instance when we start playing rivalrous games we start realizing that it's not just us against somebody else it's teams against larger teams right answer them the idea of the team is we're supposed to cooperate with each other to compete against somebody else but compete against someone else idea ends up going fractal and i end up even competing against my teammates sometimes and that's part of that why the [[collective intelligence]] doesn't scale thing is because ou cooperate with my other buddies on the basketball team unless there's also a thing called the most valuable player and i'm in the running for it and i have a chance to make the three-point shot rather than pass even though it decreases the chance of the team winning now i have a incentive misalignment so i might go for that and then it gets bigger where [435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=435.539s)

there's a couple of us that both want the same promotion to the same position at the company and we're actually going to try and sabotage the other one even though that harms the company because my own incentive is not coupled with their incentive and with the company and then i can look at say a couple different government agencies that are competing for the same chunk of budget it will [457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=457.71s)

actually seek to undermine each other so they get more of the budget when they're supposed to be on the same called that country and so what we realized as we get this thing called you know like fractal disinformation fractal decoherence and defection happening everywhere and that creates the most broken information ecology and the least effective coordination and cooperation [477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=477.199s)

possible and that's everywhere right that's ubiquitous and it's the result of that underlying rivalry so as we mentioned before now if i have some information i want to make it to where nobody else can use it i'm gonna trademark it patented protect my intellectual property and before i've released it i actually want to dis inform everybody else about it right [499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=499.129s)

tell them the gold is somewhere else so that they go dig in someone else and don't pay attention when i'm doing so if i am both hoarding information dis informing others and keeping my information from being able to be synthesized with others that means that i'm going to not let my knowledge about cancer research and whatever it is be out there because i got to make the farm [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=518.75s)

on your back so the best computer that the world could build doesn't exist because apple has some of the ip but google has some of the ip and ten other companies there some of the ip and to the best computer that science knows how to build can legally not be built in and the best phone and the best car and the best medicine and the best every thing there is because we keep the [542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=542.899s)

actual adaptive knowledge from synthesizing let alone that everybody is having to reproduce the same work because we don't want to share our best practices and then almost all the budget is going into marketing against the other ones rather than actual development and the marketing is just lying in manipulation you know at least about why ours comprehensively better [563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=563.42s)

when they then have to say the same thing about what their ip does that's good in our ip does nothing now imagine if we had a world where all the ip gotta be synthesized nobody was dis informing anybody else nobody was sabotaging anyone else everyone was an incentive to share all of the info and to synthesize all the info to synthesize all of the [585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=585.23s)

intellectual property ideas etc work towards the best things possible imagine how much more innovation would actually be possible how much more [[collective intelligence]] and capacity would actually be possible now if our source of adaptive advantage is that right is we make a world where and now we have to come back to we were talking about if you possess a good and [605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=605.93s)

i no longer have access to it were in a rivalrous relationship right you possessed a piece of information and that i don't didn't get to have access to were in reverse information of knowledge etc but if you have access to something and we've structured the nature of access where we have engineered the scarcity out of the system such that you're having access [624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=624.529s)

doesn't make me not have access and you having access leads to you being a human who has a full life and some of your full life is creativity and generativity and so now not only do you have the full access to those transportation resources but also maker studios and art studios and education and healthcare and all the kinds of things would make you a healthy well adaptive creative person and every [644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=644.48s)

well adapted person's creative because nobody wants to just chill out watching tv all the time unless they were already broken broken by a system that tried to incent them to do that nobody wants to do or if they can get away out they will be there broken person but if someone was supported in an education system to pay attention to what they were innately fascinated in and [662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=662.209s)

facilitate that they'll all become masterful at some things within eight intrinsic motivation to do those things and so now in a world where we support everybody to have access to the things that they are intrinsically incentive to want to create which if right now i get status by having stuff but if we are engineering secure seos system everyone has access nobody possesses any of it [685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=685.13s)

everybody has access to all but there's no status of having things as totally boring there's no differential advantage the only way you get status the only way you get to express the uniqueness of who yours by what you create and so now the whole system's oriented towards that they don't create something to get money because money for what to have access to she already have access to it but [701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=701.69s)

because you get to be someone who created that thing in both your own intrinsic experience evident extras are they getting to offer to the world will recognize that so now we have a situation where we all have access to commonwealth resources they create an anti rivalries relationship to each other and obviously i'm just speaking about this at a hundred thousand foot [722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=722.3s)

level and we could drill down on what the actual architecture looks like but there's actual architecture here that is viable that means the designs create and we have sense-making processes where we look at what a good design would be before making a proposition for a design that don't lead to polarization and radicalization but that lead to progressively better synergistic [740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=740.68s)

satisfiers that get us out of theory of trade-offs and into race and interested satisfiers also as a way of having people be more unifying and on the same team now if i've got this world where its source of competitive advantage if you want to call it that is it it is obsoleted competition within itself so it has real coherence then not only is the quality of life they radically [764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=764.47s)

higher because the people don't feel lonely and they actually have creative  to do and they aren't being used as instrumental pawns to some other purpose and etc and the quality of life is better because they're actually making better medicine and better technology and better etc because of the ability for the ip to synthesize and you know everything else but this world can also [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=783.97s)

out in to innovate in really key ways other places in the world and for then rather than the rest of the world wanting to attack it the world it can actually say here will export solutions you want and to the rest of world sorts of creative cause like dependence relationship then the rest of world says  we want to be able to innovate why were they able to solve that problem we [803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=803.08s)

weren't able to solve what cooler guys were like sabotaging each other and their guys weren't sabotaging each other we say great here's the [[social tech|social technology]] we use now as soon as they implement that it's not being recognized that's just the world actually shifting that's where this model actually becomes a new basin of attraction the world starts flowing - and so you have to do [819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=819.43s)

that you create a prototype of an of a full-stack civilization that is anti rivalries it is anti fragile against rivalry frank's non power and that is otto propagating but by the nature of the solutions that it is exporting and by its own adaptive capacity its own design starts to get implemented other places and that's ultimately the designer that is a path to a post [845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=845.41s)

[[existential risk]] world which is building it and prototype in a way we're at otto propagates that's so exciting are there places where these prototypes are being built kind of but not really there are intentional communities where people are trying to practice some things that they feel will be relevant a closed-loop agriculture system right where they at [868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=868.81s)

least have [[regenerative agriculture]] and maybe some kinds of social coherence technologies where they have a better system of conflict resolution than our current judicial system better parenting better education like we have those things and those are cool and they're valuable but they still have to buy their computers from apple and fly on a boeing to get somewhere that depends [889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=889.3s)

upon environmental destruction war and so they can't actually provide a high-tech civilization so then they're not yet civilization models and the civilization models are all part of this one dominant subluxation model so this is a next endeavor and before a full-stack civilization occurs obviously partial ones but that are directed towards a full-stack civilization have [912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=912.76s)

to occur because in the world we're talking about there is no place for the things currency called judges or lawyers or politicians or bankers because those systems don't exist now that doesn't mean that there isn't a equivalent of a judicial system but it's totally different from the level of the theory of ethics to the jurisprudence and somebody has to be getting trained in [932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=932.23s)

the civic's of that system and there's nothing like banking but there are things like paying attention to how the accounting of this new economy works but people have be trained in that i'll give you one for instance if we think about the physical economy so we'll take attention now and just look at physics we see that there's at least three different kinds of physics involved in [952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=952.24s)

the [[materials economy]] that are fundamentally different in their math so there is a physics of atoms physical atoms there is a physics of energy and there's the physics of bits and right now those are all fungible i can use the same dollar to buy software or to buy energy or to buy metals or physical stuff right food but there's a fixed number of atoms of a certain type on the [978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=978.91s)

planet that are reasonably accessible and right now we're just taking them from the environment in a way that causes depletion and then putting them back into the environment as wastes and way the caused accumulation talks to see on both sides you can't keep doing that we have to closed-loop it where we have been a give or take finite amount of metals and [996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=996.01s)

just medals but hydrocarbons everything a finite amount of atoms that are in a closed-loop relationship but it can be up cycled because we have the energy to upcycle them which means putting the same atoms into higher pattern where the pattern is evolving the pattern stored in bits so if i take the atoms out of one battery put it in a new battery which evolved as battery technology that [1015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1015.06s)

new battery is in bits a blueprint and i'm going to use energy to take the atoms in the current form disassemble them and reassemble them into this new battery and so there's a fixed amount of atoms we have to close loop those there's not a fixed amount of energy we get new energy from the sun every day but we have kind of a finite bandwidth to how much we get so we have to operate [1039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1039.63s)

within that's not closed loop right we can use that up and it has entropy but within that bandwidth we have to work and then dips are fundamentally unlimited limited only by the compute of the energy and matter so that can keep you know expanding basically indefinitely once i've made a bit i can reproduce it exponentially without any unit cost because i can [1063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1063.54s)

reproduce it exponentially without unit cost once i've developed it once i can get exponential returns on software in a way that i could never get on atomic stuff which is why elon has a hard time raising money for physical stuff and what's that sold for 19 billion dollars it's why all the unicorns are software and mostly [[social tech]] or fintech or something that is actually doing not [1087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1087.36s)

good things for the world but it can create exponential returns and it's why silicon valley has been basically mostly just invested in software stuff if you make those fungible you'll actually be moving the energy away from the atom and away from the energy into the virtual will away from the physical into the virtual even the virtual depends on the physical so you're actually debasing the [1110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1110.88s)

substrate upon which it depends and so you notice that since the bit we can keep having more of forever they don't go through an entropic degradation when we use them the energy we can use it entropically degrades but we get more of it every day and the atoms don't entropically degrade but we have to keep cycling them there's a fixed number the physics the [1131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1131.07s)

accounting of those are totally different that's not one economy that's fungible to itself with one accounting system that's three completely separate but interacting physical economies and now again we already said we're not owning goods we're having access to shared common wealth services but this is just first to really go into it it's a lot of things but these are examples [1151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1151.049s)

of some of the considerations that have to happen to actually be able to think about things like economics at a level of depth that is appropriate to the nature of the issues if we don't answer the question of what makes a good civilization and we simply say would allow civilization to endure and so we start with let's just say we don't want excess centralized traffic risk and [1175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1175.019s)

there's a whole bunch of different types of excess and from [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] that all have the same [[generator function|generator functions]] so we have to create categorical solutions to the [[generator function|generator functions]] it turns out that those are the [[generator function|generator functions]] that have made all the things that we intuitively have experienced that sucking like violence and environmental devastation and that [1194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1194.37s)

solving those [[generator function|generator functions]] doesn't just allow us to survive and maybe some dystopian dynamic anti [[rivalrous dynamics]] with each other and closed loop dynamics and the proper relationship between the complicated and the complex scalable [[collective intelligence]] systems and a right understanding and theory of choice in relationship with theory of causation [1214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1214.529s)

end up being a way of mapping to a world that is definitely proto becan any meaningful definition of proto p and any meaningful kind of consideration of what good could mean and so we come back to this mythopoetic we can't keep going the way that we're going there's a purgatory coming and it's gonna go one way or the other and one way is really fitting one way is really lovely that's the true [1238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1238.86s)

story and bucky fuller said utopia or oblivion and it's gonna be hit or miss til we're actually there when i couldn't know which which way it goes this the thing i would just kind of end on is what it takes if we try to solve the various risks in isolation is impossible we fail if what it takes to solve them categorically ends up also mapping to how we in [1261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1261.809s)

everyone in creating the true the good and the beautiful that is there to create progressively better both up regulating their [[sensemaking]] of what that is with themselves and with each other and being able to make that scaling the [[collective intelligence]] that is progressively answering those questions better can you leave us with some book recommendations for anyone who [1282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1282.159s)

wants to read up on this a little more and and expand their understanding books are are there resources yes i wish i could share more things than i can but a lot of what we're thinking in terms of new civilization design like this has is new doesn't mean it's not drawing on lots of elements so a couple things we mentioned jeffery west's work scale on [[collective intelligence]] that's very valuable we talk about some of the dynamics of [[game theory]] that have to shift and so finite and infinite games is just my favorite starting point and it's one of the types of books that is very simple but has multiple levels of depth of meaning that if you read it multiple times you'll be in new insights yeah that wouldn't blew my mind yep me too james cars very beautiful and [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1324.52s)

you know i have a blog civilization emerging calm that has some articles and these types of topics and there's also a book list there with a heap of books great great awesome this as always is enlightening and and so fun you know there are books that are valuable and there's obviously like all of your podcasts are valuable if you had the experience of anything that i said [1350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1350.47s)

making sense and actually seeming obvious but then you also realize you never thought it in that particular way and there's a question why did i never think it in that way even though it seems obvious after the fact and that's one of the principles that clarity when the properties that clarity has is it can add a novel insight but it seems obvious and kind of prima facie relates [1370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1370.149s)

to everything that you know let me say okay i wasn't thinking about [[rivalrous dynamics]] and upping the ante clearly enough i wasn't thinking about the exponential economy in software and atoms all being fungible like there's a problem there i wasn't thinking about open loops closed loops in this particular way but you can if you start just asking for yourself what do i think [1391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1391.84s)

is actually wrong and of all the things that seem wrong what do they have in common and why are those things that are wrong wrong what is going on and then go deeper keep going deeper with that and don't look for one answer are there a number of different things that come together that are partial answers to this and what would solving that look like and there are [1413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1413.49s)

resources of other people's thinking on these things but they won't replace they will inspire they won't replace your own deep thinking on these things for your own [[sensemaking]] and so the resource that i would offer the most is when you are bothered by something where you wish some beautiful thing existed more than it does really think hard about why things are the way they are and know [1435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1435.9s)

that the first thought you will come up with are not that good but if you stop you won't get beyond there but if you really keep working on and thinking about it and then going and researching in light of that question and then thinking about it more you actually start to get novel and meaningful and deeper [[sensemaking]] that is aligned with what is yours to pay attention to a [1455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1455.73s)

marker to relate to what you said earlier i think it really helps to use different modes of inquiry people can get stuck in just intellectual enquiry or just spiritual inquiry but you know all are valuable and when we can see the same thing from several different perspectives it becomes a 3d object rather than just being flat you just actually mentioned one of my favorite [1481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1481.26s)

practices is really endeavoring to see and experience the world through the perspective of someone else and actually see and experience it and if i'm still thinking no if i was in their position i wouldn't do that i haven't got it yet so i was in that position would be if i'm really putting myself in a position i would get enraged by the things they're enraged by i would get excited by the [1502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1502.74s)

things are excited by and so this both has a practice of empathy in connection as a practice of understanding as a practice of intelligence and learning because i see different things if i look at the world through the lens of a mechanical engineer i see everywhere that mechanical engineer see that you never saw which is different than if you look through the lens of a [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1522.45s)

fashion designer where you look through the lens of you know a [[game theory]] person they're looking at different things or an evolutionary biologist well is the universe that wasn't paying attention to like when you buy the car and you see it everywhere you put on the lens you start seeing all kinds of stuff your factory sends me but also as a kind [1536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1536.62s)

of spiritual technology of getting out of the default mode of what you think you are and when i'm trying to be someone else it's not my personality that can do that if i'm trying to take their personality well it's not my perspective that can do it it is same consciousness of witnessing my perspective that can then make me somebody else's as soon as i do that i [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1555.28s)

actually dissociate from just being my personality and then i get some more spaciousness around it and less reactive by it and this also relates to not just looking through the lens of different personalities or different modern frameworks it's also looking through the lens of pre-modern frameworks or even animal frameworks and that can all be very useful as well because if we look [1577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1577.24s)

at the world through the lens of quote-unquote primitive tribe then different things come into focus and different things become very meaningful and very powerfully meaningful like it resonates through your whole being just you know wow and that's not to be dismissed because there's something there i mean at the very minimum for self-discovery it's super useful because [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1598.81s)

you know we spent more time as those primitive versions of ourselves and we have the modern versions and you can kind of untie a lot of behaviors that you don't really realize you have based off of just looking at the world from a primitive standpoint well your air has some people decide to go visit the amazon and live with the tribe and experience the world through those eyes [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1620.56s)

and be affected by it and then look at how they can incorporate elements of that experience of the world and their previous experience of the world to being able to live more fully they'll be beautiful i really appreciated being here with you both and i think i really do want to say that i love war podcast and i level you're creating both of you together [1644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1644.5s)

it's very easy to have well informed dystopian beauty and it's easy to not think about things or it's easy to have poorly informed positive views but to have well-informed positive views is actually tricky because if we keep being anything like the kinds of people that we have always been that do really wonderful and really atrocious  with our power but having [1671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1671.49s)

exponentially more power they're all dystopian scenarios and so we have to be something really different than we've ever been which requires some type of deep shifts that could make that happen that requires some deep thinking right in some deep imagination and i know that's what you are really dedicated to doing here on the show and minded of this quote from the book of romans it [1691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1691.17s)

says the pathway to heaven is narrow and steep and the pathway to hell is wide and many and it's kind of just like a way of thinking about thermodynamics which is that there's just more ways to break shape than to build it there's like not that many ways this all the cells and your body can come together that make you with the [[emergent property]] of you there's a lot of ways that you [1712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1712.679s)

just get like 150 pounds of goo and so who is they like okay we got a lot of power and most of those scenarios with a lot of power suck how could we have this much power that doesn't suck how could we have this much power not use it against each other and we start seeing orwell in control systems and we start seeing how that sucks too and to keep thinking through how could we have it [1734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1734.19s)

that doesn't suck oh and i can't depend on aliens or jesus with coming back like how do we get us to be that kind of consciousness it's a really good way of thinking about how to actually address these problems because if we can't no voltaire's without vision man perishes if we can't even see a well grounded positive future and positive use of the technological capacity you have we are [1756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1756.69s)

not gonna make it and so i love that you all have this space dedicated to exploring i think incentive is always evil to mitch so i don't want to move from [[perverse incentive]] to positive incentive positive incentive means my [[sensemaking]] has determined what i think is good and i'm going to try and extrinsic ly override your [[sensemaking]] to make a choice aligned with my [[sensemaking]] i'm gonna use a extrinsic reward strategy to co-opt your sovereignty and have your choice making be based on my [[sensemaking]] incentive scheme are the neurons and that is always the basis of evil if i once have a [[collective intelligence]] that's actually intelligent i need everyone to have intrinsic [[sensemaking]] and choice making that is uncorruptible [1806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1806.6s)

which means it's not being co-opted by extrinsic reward and punishment schemas i got this wrong at first i used to say we have to create a world where the incentive of every agent is rigorously aligned with the well-being of every other agent and of the commons that is wrong what is right is to say that we must rigorously remove any place where the incentive of an agent is misaligned [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1833.12s)

with the well-being of other agents in the commons but a adequate future is one that has no system of structural incentive that's a mind-blower the cells in your body are actually not trying to get the other ones to do what they want them to do they have their own internal [[sensemaking]] processes and they do what makes sense to them and what makes sense them also happens to be what's good for [1859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1859.22s)

the ones around them because they depend on the ones around them and vice versa and they're in a communication process but the brain is not overriding the salesmen and in no way could handle the complexity necessary of the cells not doing their own [[sensemaking]] and so better incentive schemas as a transition which is happening in the [[blockchain]] is nice [1877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1877.94s)

it's worse than more births incentives but it is transitional not post transitional it actually does not address [[existential risk]] it doesn't give us the right [[collective intelligence]] the right [[collective intelligence]] has to be fractal sovereignty meaning at the level of an individual and every group size it has its own intact [[sensemaking]] in choice making it ends up being vectoring [1898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1898.37s)

towards omni consideration the level of that we're talking about is hard to imagine yeah and what has to be invented to even begin a transition and then be put to rest so that the next version can come along is such a long road the reason that we incent people is because we have a civilization that needs a lot of done that is not fun it's dreadful stuff [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1926.96s)

we want to get the people to do the dreadful stuff if we created a commonwealth river and had access to resources then nobody would do the dreadful stuff and so then the state would have to force them that's why we don't like communism then you get the state imperialism so we say okay cool we'll let the free market force them instead it's the economic servitude but [1946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1946.13s)

at least that doesn't look like somebody did it because the market is the just anonymous thing right if you don't do the shitty job you're homeless and your kids can't eat cool but we'll tell you the story that you can work your way up and you know become wealthy even though statistically we know that it's silly it happened to those two guys that one time even though statistically the rest of [1965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1965.17s)

the time having more resources makes it easier to make more resources and having less resources makes it harder to make more resources into the system as a gradient it makes it actually continue in the direction of inequality not that you know otherwise but so that's where incentive came from right was that's the good side at the negative side is a few controlling of many one to use incentive [1987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=1987.38s)

reward and punishment and to get people to do the shitty things we have to do that this is using choice to create a system of causation incentive as a causal system [[game theory]] as a causal system to control the choice of others controller co-op i want to have my theory of choice effect causal dynamics that are only causal ie if i make an automated robot i haven't [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2012.91s)

actually made a sentient being a utility so i'm gonna say something even deeper which is instrumental relationships are evil can you expand that yeah i'm interacting with you to meet some people that you know to get my network ahead or to get some knowledge from you or to gain access to something or to whatever it is i have something that i want to do that you are an instrument towards [2041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2041.53s)

you're a path towards to utilitarian ethic then you are a into a means for me so however i relate with you however it affects your own sovereign sentient experience is a place i might externalize harm because it's not why i'm relating with you yeah yeah and so in a healthy world world of the future other people need to have intrinsic value independent of [2069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2069.379s)

utilitarian value to everyone that's a part of the culture and not just the other people and other beings all kinds of sentient beings but relationships have intrinsic values so i'm gonna invest in the integrity of our relationship independent of me getting anything out of it because it is actually the basis of meaningfulness itself which is why in a utilitarian and [2091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2091.429s)

instrumental dynamic we're getting ahead while feeling utterly meaningless and destroying everything that is meaningful in the process that is us being hooked to addiction to a stupid game where what we think we want is not not what we actually want and what we think of as a win is actually a omni stupid thing and this is why you know like the the hindu concept of [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2116.78s)

dharma was a virtue ethics not a utilitarian ethic and and there was a very meaningful set of concepts if do what is inherently right in your relationship with life independent of what the outcome might be because you really don't know what the outcome is gonna be and if you try and just figure out the outcome is gonna be you're gonna be wrong a lot of times and [2137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2137.51s)

you're also gonna justify a lot of unethical styles and utilitarianism is kind of the rampant ethics that anyone who's paying attention to ethics pays attention to right now and it's not without any merit but it is also problematic it is up there with democracy and capitalism you know in the philosophy of science in terms of being a problematic thing to be the dominant [2158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2158.9s)

system because we cannot actually predict and [[complex system|complex systems]] well enough to do a utilitarian thing and they intrinsic dynamics of a relationship and another being in that becoming moved to being a means to an end other than them and as soon as i start factoring everything meaningful along the chain of whatever i think my howcome is to where my outcome is actually being in a way [2184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2184.73s)

that is an integrity with an honoring of all life now it's the virtue of it yeah i i was having this conversation recently about people who are obsessed with life hacking and optimizing everything and when they get into that mindset eventually they get to what what they call optimizing relationships and then they start putting people on a value [2206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2206.579s)

hierarchy where they want to interact with high-value people and they want to get a high value woman and they're using these tactics to find and attract the most high-value woman and it's funny because those people in my experience are some of the most existentially unhappy people that i've met and they will never demonstrate it outward in an outward way but that's what i've noticed [2229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2229.23s)

that you know people who try to optimize everything in this kind of utilitarian way end up really profoundly unhappy yeah what's the same thing as continuously pursuing a better hi it's i'm getting a hit from winning at a particular thing so i got to try and win at it all the time but i need the hit because my baseline is the lay feels meaningless [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2250.71s)

because i don't actually have any real relationships and there i don't even know what meaning needs i don't even know what intimacy means and so that hypo normal environment needs a [[hypernormal stimuli]] to feel anything and then the fact that i used people instrumentally has people end up not liking me which makes me hurt even more which makes me want another hit ii [2270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2270.99s)

people like you make it super dc you just come on and it's like we listen to audiobooks all day and then we get to actually talk to the person who is coming up with the cutting-edge ideas themselves so it's quite interesting thank you y'all it's always wonderful getting our brains blown by you thank you thank you both this is really fun all right that's it thanks for listening [2294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPSXsOeX6lM&t=2294.95s)
