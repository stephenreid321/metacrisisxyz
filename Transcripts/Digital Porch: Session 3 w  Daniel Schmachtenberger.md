the stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of what's happening now all right we should just have a listening music with daniel party i think that would be quite fun um welcome to the store everyone um the digital porch third edition uh so i imagine most people are aware of [33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=33.04s)

the the format uh this is sort of an open session so unlike the other sense maker in resident series uh there's no prepared topic or powerpoint or anything like that we're just going to sit on the digital porch and ask daniel schmuckenberger who's the sounds maker in residence for [51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=51.039s)

for this day and this month um questions uh and dana and i decided i mentioned this in my mailing list uh our mailing newsletter last night that we're gonna just uh have the tractor the broad attractor of [[personal development]] and personal practice during the [[metacrisis]] or the transition between game a [[game b]] and this crazy time that that we're in um so we're going to stay away from more abstract uh things like the war on [[sensemaking]] or system building and stuff like that so that being said some of you sent not that many people actually sent the questions in the survey but i might pick on you if [88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=88.24s)

you you um or choose you i should say if you asked a question but feel free to drop your questions in the chat now um maybe have a question or q before it if you don't want to be on youtube just say read on your behalf and i will do so um that being said i will allow everyone to unmute himself [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=107.6s)

daniel how's it going my friend good good to see you peter i appreciated your last article that you shared right before this on reality tunnel switching right anything um come alive for you when you read it how to navigate the interface of many very different reality tunnels like [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=133.599s)

you were discussing a kind of particular christian approach to thinking about hell and demons and uh saints and then come back to something like philosophy of science and logical positivism and say what the do i make of that is a very interesting and true tricky topic i don't know if that's the direction [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=156.16s)

we'll go down at all but it's an it was valuable to at least have you acknowledge that gaining the first person experience of a way of experiencing reality is possible without being obligatedly bound to it forever and then you can step out of it and do something with it [173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=173.599s)

so since i got first question rights i will take us down there um and some people did ask questions related to kind of like evil um so i'll read a portion of the question um is it necessary for us all together to confront evil on a cultural level i don't mean just the evil within ourselves but also collectively [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=193.519s)

acknowledge the shadow of psychopathy within the collective conscious um and i'm curious about this as i've been writing about kind of like demonic possessions and stuff like that um and i am curious about what your thoughts are on what evil is as a phenomenon or a construct do you think it exists it [210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=210.48s)

doesn't exist and if you do think it exists or something like it exists how should we personally and collectively respond to it i'm very curious to start that one with a sampling from people here of how they hold the concept and reality of evil how would you like them uh to indicate [242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=242.159s)

that on the chats or talk uh anybody wants to maybe say something just kind of indicate in the chats uh i think we should avoid popcorn style for this one um someone said that exists uh tyson flows if you can unmute yourself sure thanks when i first thing that came up for me was um like something that something is in like an entity an energy a person that wished to take advantage of me or like my insecurities or weaknesses or something to um like create suffering in a way that would further its own interests and agenda um yeah and and then the visual that came with it was like energies i've experienced specifically like in dreams um that it was like i was sleeping and i was in my bed and i was like in this like totally like vulnerable state and like some um [306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=306.639s)

uh and i encountered this entity in a dream and it's like oh you're coming after me like while i'm sleeping and i was like that was kind of felt like an encounter with something that was like the closest thing to evil maybe i've experienced yeah peter can i uh pop in because i'm the one that asked the question [328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=328.32s)

sure um where i was coming from was looking at how we as individuals talk to each other and encourage each other to do shadow work but it there's a part of me that feels like despite our best intentions and if we all do our shadow work they're still going to be malevolent people and and to like institutionalized uh [351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=351.72s)

uh systemic psychopathy that will always take advantage so that basically it's like a feeling that there's not much we can do uh that's really gonna have any impact on that force i get that sense maybe since it was your question i'll i'll uh [376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=376.479s)

say something i by no means i'm an expert in the odyssey i have friends that are scholars that have spent their whole kind of thinking career on the nature of evil from lots of different reality tunnels so i'm just sharing some rough senses that i have of it as soon as we realized that humans [406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=406.24s)

really got creative with torture techniques and tried to perfect the amount of subjective suffering that other humans can go through we realize that there's something more  up than just kind of uh effective utilitarian [[game theory]] there's something more up going on there in the [424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=424.96s)

reality of not just psychopathy but sadism right the actual positive experience associated with the negative experience of another then when we use a term like evil as opposed to um a term like say malevolence or sadism it engenders a metaphysical sense of is [445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=445.52s)

are there demons or entities or a dark side of the force or a devil or some kind of like is there a foundational ontology of evil um other than just it being distortions in the psyches and bodies and brains of people and you know there's more religious versions of that like a devil or polytheistic or animistic [473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=473.039s)

kind of demons ideas or hungry ghost realms or things and then there's kind of more new age science versions like morphogenetic fields sheldrake's work maybe there's morphogenetic field of certain kind of self-propagating destructive tendencies i'm not close to the idea that there is [499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=499.28s)

some antic reality outside of our belief or perception of it about those things but i have no good reason to believe there is more i have pretty good reason that when people believe there is it is usually an easy place for those people to get messed up i have found some people who take seriously the idea of [524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=524.159s)

demons and devils and whatever and some good comes of it but it's very easy to go down directions that i would consider net not positive from that belief which is different than saying from that as a symbolic psychological process i think it can be quite valuable if it's held as a symbolic psychological process so you're on a heavy dose of mushrooms doing a mushroom journey and you see some demons coming after you and it's possible see like even the cognitive frame of how to hold that if someone holds it as the mushrooms are helping them see into the astral realms and the demons are actually there and they have to like protect themselves from the demons in [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=570.8s)

that realm because there's some reality to it i have seen people become traumatized from journeys in that way because now they are scared of what's happening in the astral realm they're scared to go to sleep they need protection with them things like that if you hold these are phenomena arising [588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=588.88s)

in my experience arising in my mind and my phenomenology and that can't actually hurt me something arising in my mind can't actually hurt my other part of my mind or my body the fear of it maybe can so i go towards it as opposed to go away from him the same would be say in a dream we talked about this some last [606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=606.48s)

time and you know i had this experience when i first turned towards the demons and they were gonna come eat me and i'm like this is a dream this is a trip great eat me like i can't actually die here go ahead and so then the fear dissolved [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=629.76s)

because it couldn't actually really hurt me and i'm like please eat me and then so it tried to become something scary or some nasty like cockroach monster that was going to eat my eyes out and there was a moment of fear and i'm like no go go for it and so then that fear can dissolve so then it became like a black hole that was going to swell up the [644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=644.0s)

universe and like go for it and then it was like a devil that was going to eat my soul and like go for it and then it all just turned into light right there because there was no more fear there was nothing that was going to get me to go into reaction with another part of myself in that way um so that was relating to demons in a symbolic way that created psychological integration of parts of self i think that can be very helpful in terms of psychology of sadism what makes people like the psychology of sociopathy is or psychopathy is one thing how does [693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=693.92s)

someone have their empathy decoupled from other people where someone else can be feeling something they don't feel anything but then how does someone get to the place where it's flipped right where they actually feel positive emotional valence on somebody else's negative emotional state i wrestled to understand this because i couldn't really access that experience very much in myself and i still don't know that i understand it competently or fully but i have some insights some people who when they were young suffered at the hands of other people a lot felt controlled felt like they were in suffering and felt very alone in that when they go on the other side and induce someone else to be in that in that state there's something like connection that occurs someone else's experience what they experience i have witnessed that as one of the phenomena also where someone had a profound lack [753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=753.839s)

of control and they felt a lot of uncertainty and fear and insecurity and the answer was gain control sometimes people who are sadists really actually will take joy in bringing other people excitement and bringing them hope and then and bringing them sexual arousal and then also crushing them and then bringing them back because it's [771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=771.68s)

not just in anti-coupling that they're happy when the other person is miserable it's that they're happy when they get to experience their own control over reality and particularly the subjective reality of somebody else so those would both be examples of evil as a result of a compensation pattern for trauma [793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=793.12s)

right the thing that we would call evil or malevolence and people as a particular kind of trauma response that's mostly how i hold it on an individual level and then collectively there are whole cultures that are basically auto poetic traumatizers you know that are traumatizing people systemically and then those which is then conditioning people to propagate those traumas and so then you start to say like okay well if it is autopoetic there's almost like a being to it right like let's say we take capitalism capitalism is this auto-poetic self-propagating self-evolving thing right self-evolving because it goes from barter to some people wouldn't even call [838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=838.16s)

that capitalism yet but the owning of capital property um from barter to currency to fiat currency to fractional reserve fiat currency to algorithmic high-speed trading on fraction reserve fiat currency it's like an ai it's evolving its algorithm for how it does that right so you're like okay who did that well nobody did that take [861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=861.6s)

the person who figured out algo trading out of the world in history and somebody else would have and so you're like there is some auto-poetic self-propagating thing that's happening there is there almost like a spirit of that thing an entity of that thing that's why i really love that article on slate star codex meditations on molok [881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=881.68s)

because you know he's describing the autopoetic property of [[arms race|arms races]] and then kind of describing what the spirit of that thing seems like and it is really tricky when you get the sense of like okay those who seem to do the bidding of the game of power those who seem to do well at the game of [904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=904.56s)

power get more power in the system and in turn keep modifying the system to be better for people like them those who oppose the game of power including the worst evils and injustices of it are also opposing the people who are doing well at it so then those people work to get rid of the other people and so there [922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=922.8s)

is the self-reinforcing dynamic and you're like that's a very powerful [[collective intelligence]] what the do we do to keep that thing from just running to zenith which is a [[paperclip maximizer]] and this is i mean i think it was intuiting that after the you know world war one and then world war [944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=944.399s)

ii that led to lord of the rings and star wars as these great modern mythos right of sauron and the orcs or uh the death star and the empire that were like this kind of seemingly undefeatable self-propagating [[paperclip maximizer]] type thing and how was it that a small rebel alliance or fellowship of a ring [965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=965.839s)

could actually do something about it i think the energy of hopelessness that you mentioned is something that one needs to feel and not pretend that they don't feel otherwise they'll kind of fragment inside but then recognize whoa that hopelessness is actually an expression of the depth of desire for hope in me which is a which is a result of the depth of love and care in me and let me reconnect to the love and care and then reconnect to my sense of agency my sense of agency is overwhelmed so i care more than i feel like i can do anything so how do i come back to the care and [1008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1008.24s)

then how do i look to grow or increase my agency in steps rather than be able to say okay my agency's here here's this whole set of issues i can't address all of them so i'm just overwhelmed someone needs to take a more developmental approach to how to increase their agency [1025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1025.28s)

uh with that because otherwise i think one of the ways that evil gets to self-propagate is by causing overwhelm in those that would oppose it right or basically decreasing will or agency except where it has sociopathic or sadistic expressions because typically anyone who has sociopathic or sadistic orientation [1044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1044.24s)

towards power doesn't get overwhelmed and lose power right they keep seeking how do i hold empowerment more so of course okay two more things i'll say about it when we ask what is choice i'm the whole question about will and determinism is [1072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1072.24s)

like foundational existential question but if we were to define choice as being anything that is worthy of calling choice then it's distinct from just causation or summed up causation otherwise there's no basis to call a choice and then we say what is a good choice the fundamental question of ethics we can say to the degree there is a [1095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1095.28s)

reality of choice a good choice furthers the field of choice it expands the phase space of the possibilities to keep choosing so choice is reifying itself whereas a choice that debases the possibility for future choice is kind of [[self-terminating]] choice so if i am if i'm making a choice that [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1117.44s)

decreases my own agency and sovereignty we can say pretty straightforwardly that's not a good choice it ends up debasing the possibility for choice if i make choices decrease the agency of others that and i am not decreasing the phase space of choice for the whole that's also then the next level of the question a good choice increases the [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1139.6s)

face space of choice for the whole which also means the possibility of choices that would suck so you don't ever get an absolute law or binding on no choice that sucks without actually debasing choice itself um maybe you guys will have forrest on some time to speak about that that's kind of the beginning of how he [1161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1161.2s)

talks about choice and then he defines evil as that which does not further that which shuts down the possibility to further the reality of experience and choice i have a rabbi friend who describes evil as always being the result of a breakdown in intimacy and that i can't hurt somebody if i feel really connected to them and [1184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1184.559s)

if there is a sense of us as part of the web of life if there's a sense of intimacy with each other in the world evil can't really arise in that presence so they're basically disconnectedness a breakdown in the authentic intimacy of reality because because there is authentic connectedness [1202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1202.72s)

becomes the niche in which evil can arise probably just opened up more questions than answered but those are the first thoughts that come to mind all right and and um forrest landry is coming to the stoa on october 27th for those of you who are interested um what's it called so keith yeah keith you [1224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1224.88s)

had a follow-up question um so i had two sort of follow-ups it's good to see you again um and so the first follow-up is uh it can you speak to the way cultures select for institutionalized sociopathy and then the second one is and i'm thinking about that in terms of the pushing to the margins of perception [1250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1250.48s)

that you might see in media where certain things are highlighted and certain things aren't in a way that allows the culture to ignore things that uh might stop it or make it second guess itself um and then the second one is uh kind of related to that how do you set up your personal empathy stack like what emotionally valent content do [1269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1269.36s)

you bring into your life intentionally um to kind of relate to the world the first topic i've talked about on a lot of podcasts of how um how [[arms race|arms races]] work and the cultures that do the more uh effectively [[game theory|game theoretic]] things get selected so i won't say too much on that i think one thing i'll say [1305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1305.039s)

is because you brought up media specifically one very easy way to do one of the easiest ways for a whole culture to buy into evil is to believe that it's righteous and all you have to do to commit an act of evil and believe it's righteous is believe the other to to be evil [1327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1327.76s)

and so it's easy to take other subjects who have [[subjective experience]] and put a label on all of them together that makes them an object and actually makes them a nasty terrible object right they're terrorists they're racists they're whatever it is and now i'm not actually relating to a being with feelings i'm relating to some bad entity that needs stopped or [1353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1353.6s)

hurt now to the degree that i heard it i'm actually doing a good thing and so there's there's this ted talk everybody should watch uh it's called something like on being wrong and um it's this lady who wrote a book and did this whole analysis [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1376.08s)

on people's psychological experience of being wrong um and in the beginning she asked the question what does it feel like to be wrong and people say well it feels embarrassing and shameful and stupid and she goes no no that's what it feels like to find out you were wrong after the fact but you were wrong for a while first what did it feel like before you found out well it usually felt like being right um because you were usually pretty certain that you you're right and in the same way what does it feel like to do evil well it usually feels like righteousness right that's the holy war um [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1410.559s)

so in the name of i'm sure my side is right and i'm sure their site is wrong even though i haven't spent real time with them and can't empathize with them and only have straw man versions of them i feel right in attacking them because i'm on the right side of history uh so anything that otherizes in a way that disconnects our empathy which breaks the intimacy ends up making evil easy to propagate and be hidden that's one thing i'd say and on the second question i can't empathize at the speed that i can take in information about the world digitally they have different process rates so if i'm with a person in front of me who's telling me about their illness or [1481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1481.44s)

their loss of a family member or whatever it is i can feel and grieve with them and there's more of a binding because of scale of the information they're sharing and the emotional experience they're in and i can kind of process it with them where my my empathy doesn't leave me so [1500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1500.159s)

overwhelmed that my only opportunity is to shut down but if i take in the war in armenian azerbaijan for five seconds as i move to the war on the india pakistan border as i move to the increasing chance of war in the south pacific seas as i move into starvation in africa as i move into what's happening in the amazon and some new [1520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1520.159s)

whales that went extinct and there's no way i can feel that right and so it actually starts to condition relating to information about others without feeling it starts to make that a pattern right a pattern of dissociation it's not very healthy so there's a partly i would say [1541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1541.76s)

just reconnecting at human scale for enough percentage of the time is actually important if i'm if i'm focused on what's happening with animal rights globally i need a certain amount of time at the local animal shelter with real dogs right with like just actually connecting to be able to ground it and if i'm [1560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1560.32s)

moving through the news quickly i need some times where i move not quickly and i'm not just trying to info process i'm trying to actually connect to the reality of it that's one thing all right any follow-up questions keith i guess uh if i had a follow-up um i am kind of curious i definitely feel daniel uh what you're talking about with [1594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1594.32s)

just the getting turned off emotionally by you know like i think anyone who's engaging with highly cognitive you know trying to save the world kind of content is going to run into that barrier um and then it's like okay i guess like my initial thought is like okay well maybe i'll just try to get [1619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1619.6s)

figure out like where my agency is and then emotionally relate to the things that i actually have agency over and then but then there's this question of like is that fundamentally limiting my like i'm limiting my scope and do i just like turn on world food maps and see everywhere that's starving and then like [1638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1638.799s)

try to reorient with this more objective overview i i don't know what you do um so i'm kind of curious how you break it down yourself um this is a very crude example but it's not worthless let's say you have an athletic goal that's very far from where you're currently at so for fun let's say you want to binge press 500 pounds [1673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1673.679s)

there's actually no amount of trying to bench press 500 pounds it will ever let you get it you'll just hurt yourself because you your muscles can't actually develop in that direction without bench pressing 180 pounds and then 200 and then 220 and so you can keep tuning into it you can keep watching the person who can for inspiration you can keep being aware [1699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1699.2s)

that it's a direction you're wanting to trend but then you also have to come back to actually work at the edge of where your current capacity is if you want to grow your capacity because if you just keep trying to bench press the 500 you can do that for years and never actually make any progress [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1713.919s)

there's a similar thing where most of your time having your study be associated with things you can do stuff about so you also get closed feedback loops on am i getting this right is it working right i get some empiricism actually helps you understand it better and grow your agency well having some attention on the bigger [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1733.84s)

problems to know emma of all the directions i could develop what direction do i want to develop in um but they're in the same way that you want to have a relationship between the cognitive knowledge and the feeling you want to have a relationship between the cognitive knowledge of the big picture and the sense of what you can actually do about it agentically and that there [1752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1752.48s)

is a growth in your agency that could converge towards the things that you're studying and it doesn't mean you have to know all the steps of how it converges you actually have to let go of knowing that but you have to have a sense that your agency's actually increasing from the nature of your endeavors [1770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1770.64s)

okay um so many good questions uh ryan you're up next hey daniel thanks so much for being here i've been really enjoying your work thanks peter for having us so yeah just curious how you personally parse those things apart how you personally avoid limbic hijacking in the ecosystem of media as it is today [1808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1808.559s)

i don't avoid it uh i would be i would be lying if i said i could avoid it it's like saying that i could smell pizza and avoid having a physiologic response hunger response like i might choose not to eat it but a response is gonna occur right and because there is a those those molecules in the air have a real response and the same is true with [1841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1841.679s)

those bits on the screen and so when i see the framing of um whatever right cops attack a bunch of protesters and i see that thing i'm like i feel a fired up thing so then the question is how do i process that since i know that it has an effect and since i know that [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1871.44s)

it's all bias i don't let myself share the piece or believe it or act on it before i do the rest of my [[sensemaking]] work right so i then go look to see okay is there another side to this story that's reporting a different way and it usually limbically hijacks me the opposite oh [1893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1893.36s)

those cops came after these people attacked them um and whatever and i see like a nearly opposite limbic hijack and so i can't say we'll have no bias i can say we'll try to take more different biases that are in dialectic so that i'm not just controlled by some of them so rather than say unbiased i'd say bias [1914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1914.08s)

corrected um so simply identifying whenever there is a view whether it comes down to what is true or a value statement that is polarized i want to make sure that i actually understand and have felt and could argue both sides of it well [1937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1937.84s)

before i share anything or take a position sometimes it's not just two things in dialectic sometimes there's a few perspectives that are really different and trending i call that the narrative landscape so i want to understand the narrative landscape um once i can kind of put myself in the position of how different people are [1956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1956.64s)

seeing and feeling this then i can kind of not just empathize with them but also get some parallax beyond it all right um let's go with harry harry you had a question hey daniel um i just want to say i actually love listening to all your stuff so this is really cool uh [1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=1982.96s)

my question is actually what you kind of finished on last time which is something you're interested in around how do we create systems where we can best see where people at different developmental stages can develop at what rates so my question is is on the topic of that [2003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2003.039s)

how do we take into account the different stages and i'm using the integral model here as we map out heading into [[game b]] and do you have any insight into creating a methodology that takes each stage whether it's the ethnocentric ecocentric or the global centric stages into account to bring us collectively [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2021.44s)

into the ability to hold that globalized empathy or perspective i actually think historically i'm bad at this um have zach stein come on and talk about it he knows this much better than i do uh i find that i can do a decent job with this one-on-one where i'm getting to [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2051.119s)

ask a lot of questions and really get a sense of how someone is modeling something and how they're responding but as far as the generalizations of different one-on-one learners into a group that we call a developmental level and how to appeal to that developmental level differently than other ones [2069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2069.599s)

i don't think that's something that i understand well or i'm great at uh i think it's important which is why i would encourage you having zach on uh i think i can if i'm not talking to a single person where i'm getting to calibrate i think i err on the side of assuming people can hold more complexity than [2094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2094.0s)

they actually can pretty often and then sharing things that are actually not that useful uh so i usually rely on other people who are better at that to help make sure that's being rightly translated and zach is coming back to the stoa this thursday is going to be a guest star with greg henriquez and they're going to [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2116.0s)

have like meta system sex so maybe you can sneak that question there um all right i think uh who said this one uh regarding proto-b's didn't copy and paste your name if you're going to mute yourself if you know who you are oh nathan that's you you're going to mute yourself okay i'll read on your behalf nathan uh [2148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2148.72s)

regarding proto-b's i've been studying aspects of proto-b structures that can help transfer over to [[game b]] how can we prevent them from becoming a cult-like structure us versus the mentality would being physically decentralized grouping help prevent some of this uprooting not necessary so it's a hard it's a hard topic [2195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2195.28s)

um i don't know the answer because we haven't had proto-b's that are successful to like i don't have enough empirical background on that in general if a community wants to prototype a way of living that's very different than the rest of the world they usually want a certain degree of autonomy from the world to build that [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2220.88s)

culture and not have dominant culture keep pulling it back into other norms and usually they're doing that because they think that there is some way of being uh and behaving together that is better than the current [[social structure]] so then it's hard not to have a sense of separation and better than and maybe [2242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2242.0s)

even assessment of real like if you assess that current civilization is a [[self-terminating]] [[paperclip maximizer]] and most of the aspects of culture probably part of that it's very easy to do that thing again where you convert the subjects in it to part of that object structure um and you know feel [2261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2261.28s)

dissonance or superiority or at least a lack of connection and so to say well the goal of having it be able to include everyone well that's not enough because the crusades had the goal of christendom being able to include everyone right um but in a way that didn't really include the actual intelligence of others that [2290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2290.32s)

might be different it just included that everybody should think the superior that we think it's almost like there is a certain kind of faith in [[collective intelligence]] that is important where i have a sense that other people who think differently than me if we can engage in good faith that i would trust [2314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2314.48s)

the quality of the output of that dialectic more than i trust myself because possibly they'll surface things i'm not seeing right like there's a this was almost like the the spirit of democracy that was held almost religiously that there's this idea of a [[collective intelligence]] that is trusted where someone is willing to lean in and do difficult work and make [2336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2336.56s)

compromises and listen to that they don't agree with and the thought that it could act is actually has higher potential for good insight and [[sensemaking]] than them or their subgroup that shares the same bias as you know i lived in this uh i went to this university undergrad [2362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2362.079s)

uh called maharishi university and it was a really funny place that maybe the most extreme town gown division that i have witnessed anywhere because uh there was a college in the middle of the corn fields of iowa in this little town called parsons college been like an old beautiful kind of victorian campus and uh there was this kind of vedic [2383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2383.599s)

hindu teacher who wanted to bring meditation over to the west and then actually have it be the basis of a whole educational system and they were looking for university and they got this good deal on parsons college so you end up getting this like university of higher education largely based on eastern thought in the middle [2405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2405.599s)

of the corn and pig fields of iowa and so so you've got like a you know basically an intersection between physics consciousness studies and a hindu temple and then you know a bunch of farmers and it was very easy to feel a certain sense of like the better understanding and eliteness of the people in the university [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2430.72s)

environment and see the corn farmers as some simpletons but it was only easy to do that if you didn't interact with them deeply but then you interact with them deeply and you find out that they actually spend a lot more time on the earth and under the sky and connecting to the plants [2449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2449.28s)

than the people who are in the university do and that there's a certain kind of connectedness to nature and wisdom and maybe reliability and integrity that they have that that the people in the other place didn't didn't have the same way and so i think if the proto-b is connecting with people outside deeply [2468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2468.64s)

enough to actually stay connected to the the humanness of them so it doesn't go into kind of um separatist superiority that's one helpful thing all right um man i don't know a question to choose david sweadlow uh if you can find yourself yeah thanks um i'm curious what you're learning [2500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2500.4s)

um from your entitlement inquiry on facebook um we had we had a glassbeat game last week and it came up and there was a really robust discussion but i'm curious what you're taking from the comments there or your thoughts on that uh premature i just posted that i think two days ago and have only had a chance to read about [2522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2522.16s)

half the comments and not really sit with and reflect on them i was i was actually positively surprised that there were a lot of quite insightful thoughtful things from different perspectives being shared it was actually a higher quality [[collective intelligence]] input for a facebook thread than i [2543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2543.68s)

have experienced on a lot of other questions i put out there and so i'm kind of curious as to why that is why that question in particular posted a question of what do you feel entitled to and why uh and so of course people got into the semantics of what does entitlements mean are we saying entitled by law because we all agreed [2566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2566.4s)

in law or entitled by um a cultural set of norms or entitled by universe in some kind of absolute sense or um and it is entitled as a court of law would support versus feel entitled um and then there's a big difference between i am entitled to this versus i value this and would work hard to protect it but don't assume [2590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2590.24s)

that it is just a given um i think one of the things that a lot of people surface it was valuable is there are human rights that i really appreciate there's rule of law that i appreciate but if i feel entitled to it and everybody feels entitled to it nobody takes the responsibility to maintain it then it will break down [2609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2609.2s)

turn into you know tyranny so it's actually critical to value it and not feel entitled to continue to do the work and maintenance um and so saying i don't feel entitled doesn't mean a kind of nihilism of that there that we don't want a society that does a [2626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2626.16s)

better job of rights it means that we have to bind the responsibility to do the work to ensure that thing one of the things that i noticed is i didn't ask the question what does your behavior demonstrate that you feel entitled to in your day-to-day interactions that you aren't admitting like if you thought more about it [2653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2653.68s)

because a lot of people took it to the macro level of what do i feel entitled to by the state or by the market or by law or you know by god or something like that but it's interesting how often we just get pissed off at someone else because they didn't do the dishes or whatever it was or they didn't you know tell me the thing or [2672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2672.0s)

acknowledge me or and it's very clear i felt entitled to like i i felt that they were supposed to do that thing and i got disappointed and upset when they didn't and so it was very interesting to see how many people said i don't feel entitled to anything which means when they're cognitively reflecting they acknowledge that that is the like [2692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2692.56s)

formally true thing but then to take the next step of but where are all the places where that actually is in your experience and what do you do about that differential so those first few insights but i'm actually looking forward to having some more time with it all right uh kelly you are up [2711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2711.28s)

hi uh can you hear me okay so thanks uh first i want to thank you daniel and contextualize this through one of your past appearances here where someone asked you about something you connected with right livelihood and you basically propose that we can think of livelihood outside of the context of income and what it is that is mean what matters to us and then pursue that so that kind of like unlocked me to think about what matters to me and i found a thing that matters to me and i've been beginning to work on it for me that thing is homelessness and i'm working on contextualizing it i'm aware my work is like pointing out [2759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2759.359s)

what we here probably all know that it's rooted in these systemic issues systematic issues like the game a world right so all my work in trying to conceptualize it i'm getting stuck because i don't i can't see the new vision the new story of homelessness so my question for you is what do we do when we know what [2785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2785.68s)

matters to us and we understand why it matters and like what the barriers are but we're in need of frame breaking in order to unlock this the new [[problem space]] so to speak if that makes sense one thing i try to do is to see if anyone has actually figured key parts of it out that i'm [2809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2809.92s)

just not aware of um i like to know where the boundary of the best thought is because i acknowledge that there's a lot of smart people that have spent a lot of time on a lot of these things and it might not be like common knowledge but it's knowledge um then if nobody has worked on something knowing that is really valuable and then [2828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2828.079s)

i say okay well what is the process for to get other thoughtful people and kind of work on this thing together and figure it out but uh as far as homelessness goes like i think the the first process that comes to mind for me is i would i would look at examples of places that don't have [2847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2847.92s)

homelessness and what they did right i would do a positive deviant analysis positive deviant on any problem is where you have a distribution and you look for who's doing best with that thing to understand the mechanics in common of that i would look for any places that have had relatively good homelessness [2864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2864.72s)

solutions they had homelessness and now they have much less or much less you know consequential homelessness and see what interventions have worked well and then similarly what are the projects that are in process that seem best informed uh so you know i know of a few on this topic mimi silbert and the delancey street foundation did really good work on um reform of uh drug-addicted violent felons um usually multi-generation drug addicted violent felons so they were born into gang families or whatever and getting them to be able to hold a job and hold a home and stay out of prison so it was homelessness but [2913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2913.52s)

a deeper set of things and they ended up figuring out some things that worked really quite well and lastingly um i have a friend named nelson del rio that i think has one of the best homelessness solutions that i'm aware of that uses mostly market solutions where he can make affordable places where people pay rent that are is actually rent that is going towards [2940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2940.0s)

ownership and a co-op model that is goes along with teaching people financial literacy and job literacy and those types of things so the homeless people go from homeless to having a place to be to eventually gainfully employed homeowners and the kind of responsibility of ownership that comes um and he put together a financial model for a real estate play that makes that possible i think that's probably one of the most promising things um there's obviously the like make tiny homes and put them somewhere and put the people in them and it's cheaper than what it costs to keep putting them in jail and having them not on the street not in [2977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=2977.76s)

jail is probably better but if it doesn't offer some like developmental direction where they become more self-authoring that's still pretty limited and uh so the direction where people are not just living on a handout or not just renting but moving towards uh a sense of something like ownership um with as long as we're within a frame [3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3000.24s)

like capitalism uh is quite helpful uh kelly looks like you have to follow up if you want to jump in well i so that's i really appreciate everything you said and it makes me reconsider if i was like thinking too big but maybe i want to press you and and my thinking is that all of the things [3025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3025.119s)

you described similar to like all the like silly sort of toy ideas i thought of are still kind of framed in working which i guess we have to work within the systems that exist so but i'm more like curious and maybe it's just an impossibility like to how do you like i want to think of like or like work with other people [3046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3046.88s)

to discover like a new vision or like rediscover an old vision like how do we like to me when i see homeless people i recognize that they are like trapped in a space and i feel a certain way towards them that i know like other people don't feel so i want to figure out a way where people we don't have to try to do [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3067.52s)

anything to make it so that like homeless isn't a problem but so that people have a new sense of what you know what i don't know i might be thinking too big and maybe i just need to start in a more practical way say again you were starting to say that you you want people to have a sense of [3084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3084.079s)

so oh i like i i think the like ideal solution is that people have a sense that or maybe i'm just trying to reconnect the dots but the thought i was going with was like if you have to create a program to remediate homelessness then you're not re-envisioning homelessness you know if if homelessness if the way [3109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3109.68s)

that we envision the thing like the this the contributors to homelessness were truly changed then you wouldn't have to try which i think so the point that you made about looking where homelessness isn't a problem i think that's actually a really good idea i didn't think of but um i don't know if that gives you anything [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3128.559s)

more to think about or if i'm again like kind of pushing too hard yeah so i mean if you want practical examples you look at place where places where there isn't much homelessness or where they've solved homelessness problems and you see what they did because then you know it actually works maybe that maybe their situation doesn't work for [3146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3146.24s)

all other situations but at least in some context works then you need to make sure you understand the context well enough was it a country that has a big sovereign wealth fund that was able to afford it and other countries couldn't or was it a small country that had a very strong religious homogeneous culture that had a sense of [3162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3162.079s)

you know charity like because if you try to apply something that was unique to a context outside of that context you might be missing something but you can at least start to see some things there are other ways to reimagine homelessness so you can there are some future oriented projects [3179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3179.44s)

that don't assume capitalism or don't assume you know [[private property]] ownership of homes or something like that they'd have thought about re-envisioning homelessness like the venus project um jacques fresco of the venus project was actually very influential for me early on um and you know he's passed now but uh the venus project continues and peter joseph is extending some of that work and so they propose a kind of commons-based cybernetic society in which most property is not based on [[private property]] ownership but generative access and so you can look at something like that from the point of view of like [3223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3223.68s)

reimagining at a whole global level though of course there's a couple questions you have to ask one is it's never been implemented and you have no idea if it's actually going to work and two you have to ask in order to get it implemented and to have it work what does it take and one of you know peter thiel's [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3240.319s)

question of you have an idea that you think is better there's some people who really don't like that idea what level of violence do you need to employ to get that idea put in place and is it still a good idea factoring the amount of violence it takes to make happen factoring counter pressures [3255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3255.04s)

which is kind of a classic libertarian question right which is since i'm not god or king and get to just decree it be so the kind of omniscient question of what can't we all just get along what's the best way that we could just make it all happen well okay there's a pretty big gap from imagine right john clinton singing [3274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3274.8s)

imagine to how the do we build anything here with all the people doing the things where with with some people really wanting a zionist israeli state and some people really thinking that that's the great tragedy and the world can't be okay until it's gone and wanting a caliphate and um some people really believing in [3294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3294.24s)

social darwinism and wanting the wealth concentration and you got to say okay so with this world with these people right and these dispositions how do we move this thing forward so it's valuable to imagine what it could be but then the path there ends up being where there's a lot of devils in the details [3315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3315.04s)

that ends up being very kind of meaningful so this is why i have much more appreciation for the things like what nelson del rio's doing that are can actually take people out of homelessness and actually put them on a path towards more self-authorship in the current world effectively without needing violence [3335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3335.119s)

and i'm like oh that's actually quite meaningful is it and and can it continue to advance itself can it develop capacities that can be reinvested to develop more capacities so that it eventually converges as far as other things where you can think about reimagining homelessness you can go backwards [3358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3358.799s)

and look at indigenous cultures where there's some sense okay nobody there was homeless they were all kind of communally cared for but then you can then you have to ask why did that thing stop and is that commensurate with the ideas of classical liberalism um and kind of nation liberal [[nation state|nation states [3383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3383.76s)

]] which it's obviously not and so then you say well from the nation-state liberalism capitalism point of view where people are wanting where there's a system that's wanting to at least in theory maximize individual independence and sovereignty and not be controlled by some top-down state that we don't trust [3402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3402.079s)

or some top-down organization then that also means people can their lives up and what responsibility do they have for themselves and how do you solve the free writer problem of if the if some other group is then obligated to wealth redistribute how are they obligated is there some physical violence that is going to force [3422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3422.48s)

them to put their capital there so these are these are tricky problems a lot of people have thought about these things maybe you will come up with some very meaningful breakthroughs that nobody has and i would say if you're willing to dedicate some real earnestness to it you probably can and enough people have done [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3444.96s)

enough good thinking it's probably worth understanding both the success examples and the [[problem space]] pretty well and then there's that saying the master has failed more times than the average person has tried for you to make real innovation in the space will require not getting disheartened when it's really when almost all of your answers are wrong for a long time all right uh christian you just popped in a question that's interesting if you can unmute yourself yeah sure daniel my question is what are the aspects of [[personal development]] and personal practice that you've been thinking about the most lately um also where do you think in terms of personal practice and development we need to pay generally speaking the most attention to like where are we lacking the most and what's getting um looked past and then what are any like recent developments you've seen uh in these areas like maybe in terms of new psychotechnologies that are popping up that would be useful for people to explore thanks i really like the bildung concept that thomas bjorkman has been talking [3543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3543.599s)

about peter v thomason good because it transcends the agency communion or individual and collective divide which is how do i develop myself as an individual in service to bettering not just my life as an individual but the collective um so it's [[personal development]] of effective citizens not just effective people uh i think those ideas are very often decoupled where there's [[personal development]] for like most people's vision boards when they're doing [[personal development]] is like a dope life for them um and pretty individualistic and they're doing good to the degree that that makes [3596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3596.16s)

them feel good and it's a dope life for them um or someone is willing to work for the collective at great sacrifice so they'll go be a soldier or they'll be a frontline non-profit activist worker whatever but they are developing themselves to a limited point to start to use themselves and not [3621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3621.68s)

continuing to develop themselves to be in greater and greater service so the idea of an ongoing development of self to be ongoingly useful to all other selves uh i think it's really important that those two are bound so that's one thing i would say and so i i really like the the build-on kind of model for that [3645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3645.04s)

and then with regard to specific psychotechnologies so let's let's kind of categorize them you've got things like cbt and the lefco method and byron katie's the work and basically cognitive models where you're doing you're looking at experiences that have you create a generalized belief or meaning [3675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3675.28s)

structure and then working on seeing the effect of that belief or meaning structure overlaid on other environments has it's not effective in working on changing that belief or meaning structure and then you've got uh emotional work like um gestalt and catharsis work and emotional release and primal screaming [3699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3699.119s)

and things that are around where emotion was experienced and there was kind of physiologic sensation emotional sensation and it didn't get to move how do we actually allow it to move through us and out and then you've got somatic work like is there a way that this is connected to my body of the kind of embodied cognition the brain is not the only part that has consciousness related to it so you have trigger point work and heller work and somatic experiencing and all these things that are working on connecting to emotions in connection to the body and moving them or unwinding there then you have like sensory stuff like [3739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3739.039s)

where someone is triggered whenever they hear a loud sound because the gunshot sound that happened in vietnam or they're bothered by yellow because that was the color of the room that they were beaten when they were a kid or whenever they see a man that looks like a certain thing that there were sensory [3757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3757.44s)

images that were pavlovian associated with traumas and they want to change those sensory conditions that are the triggers and so you'll see things like nlp techniques that are designed to pull up sensory images and or some psychedelic assistant psychotherapy and change the pavlovian association [3774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3774.88s)

with those sensory images i would say that those are not fungible the those all do different valuable things and they don't do the same valuable things and so i'm i'm as far as psychotechnologies i'm less interested in like here's a favorite psychotechnology and more [3798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3798.72s)

saying it's valuable to be aware of the different spaces and levels in which they act and the partial value that they each have and the synergies that can be there between them so that someone kind of pays attention to working across those spaces i had experience of going through a [3816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3816.0s)

particular psychotherapeutic process and going through my whole childhood all the events linearly and having healing around all kinds of things and then going through a different psychotherapeutic process they work from a totally different angle going back to the things and having totally different insights that related to increased [3831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3831.44s)

freedom and happiness and capacity you know many times um and i think that's where things like the integral model come in that are saying how do we take multiple different valuable things see which ones are best for us at a given time and how to not become a fundamentalist to one technique but to be able to see what [3852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3852.24s)

actually seems meaningful and useful so i would say the binding of the development of the individual to their dharma and the contribution to the whole and the binding of the different parts of self work to each other uh are a couple things that come to mind for me so i have a follow-up question uh with [3876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3876.48s)

that so christian who who just spoke he's doing something at the store called bespoke psychotechnology where he's you know he shows his own psychotechnology stack and kind of empowers us to figure out how to create our own uh and and as you know we have a wisdom gym here at the stoa where we have reoccurring events like collective presencing empathy circle we have a wim hof guy comes in three three times a week bioenergetics is coming um and we're doing like these short research type r d projects where like margaret the lady who spoke last week we did communitas club where we're [3908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3908.319s)

investigating all these different intersubjective and conversational modalities and if they work we can import it in the wisdom gym we're going to have something like a psychotherapy cafe where we do the same with all these modalities a sovereignty society and the idea is to have sort of like a robust wisdom gym maybe like a metasanga [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3924.96s)

that has all these different kind of practices and maybe wisdom trainers can kind of guide people and all that other than that i have no idea what i'm doing but um given all that that framework i just said do you think there's any potential there and how would what would you uh say to guide that process a couple of thoughts that come up is uh there's some kind of developmental work that makes shifts that once they've happened they can't be undone right they're really kind of directional shifts and then there's other kind of work that is really more like exercise like you can be very buff and stop exercising and lose it and it really requires [3968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3968.4s)

maintenance and it's valuable to know which is which um because one of the things that can happen is someone takes a period where they're doing a lot of study or a lot of developmental work they reach a certain level of clarity and feeling of empowerment where they start saying okay now i can go build stuff in the world based on this [3986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=3986.16s)

but it's some stuff that requires maintenance they drop the maintenance and they're like taking it for granted and then lose the the foundation with capacity um so it's valuable to know what kinds of things are like oh i've i've had that insight and now i can never see it the same way again versus [4004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4004.48s)

um this is a kind of muscle that has to be ongoingly it might not take as much work to maintain it just like muscles as it does to develop them and then what is an ongoing development routine i think maintenance is super unsexy for the most part i think like new is has its own novelty uh dopamine hit to it [4025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4025.359s)

and in general like it's more fun to build a house and get to see there's a house and there wasn't a house than it is to like wash the dishes forever and all i get to show for it is forever that they're it's the same as opposed to that it's different in a finite period of time [4046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4046.0s)

um and yet the house is not very good if i don't do the maintenance stuff right um and so i think one of the things that's super valuable is to actually culture a very high value around the maintenance because otherwise there's a whole lot of take two steps forward and then take two steps back and it's all very exciting and that net in [4067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4067.68s)

ten years you actually didn't change your life very much versus if i can make a small bit of progress but maintain it and this progress i made in my relationships when i was putting a lot of attention there now when i go to put movement in my business i don't lose the relationship focus because i'm doing the maintenance [4083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4083.92s)

even if i'm only making a small bit of progress in an area at a time but then i'm maintaining the areas that i developed over the course of a decade i might have actually moved a lot so i think actually creating a high value around the maintenance of things that are meaningful and that require it is very helpful [4104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4104.56s)

and then another thing when you're talking about uh you know a wisdom gem is when i shared that there were processes i went through that were very powerful and then later on different processes or sometimes even the same process just later with more emotional majority that had whole other layers of insight [4131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4131.52s)

i think there's a benefit to settling into the personal growth happens forever there is not like uh i'm going to push real hard and get there and then once i'm there then i'll be able to do my work in the world then i'll be able to have a relationship or be fulfilled it may be that there is a particular place i want [4151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4151.12s)

to get to before i move attention to like just not be depressed all the time or to feel like i can communicate well enough to have a decent relationship but i'm still going to be working on my own evolution as a person forever in layers and so there's a certain kind of settling into that that is willing to [4170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4170.08s)

and takes delight in continuing to put effort in without the impatience of when do i get there that's uh that's helpful yeah we'll keep the mind is uh like similar to spiritual bypassing maybe there's like spiritual distraction where like oh i have to you know level up before i actually like [4194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4194.32s)

engage in my dharma in the world um you see that as a phenomenon yeah i remember i mean it was so important for me and it sounds so immature and it was but uh it's usually hard to see ourselves as really immature in the moment because we're looking through the lens that we have um in retrospect it's [4222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4222.4s)

usually quite easy uh i remember i had this very strong when i was young monastic impulse and a very strong um romantic poetic lover impulse and they were very torn the monastic impulse was both in terms of like depth of meditation and practice and dharma work that i wanted to do that i thought would be so consuming that i couldn't possibly be a good partner and i didn't want to be a shitty partner but i also had this sense that the foundation of the meaningfulness of everything is love and there's a way in which that expressed itself an intimate relationship that was so meaningful one [4265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4265.12s)

to be honored this was like a huge source of inner conflict in my early life and so at one point i had to uh say okay i'm gonna give the monastic thing full rain so it stops pulling me out of not being able to be in my relationships fully so ended a relationship with someone who [4287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4287.04s)

was really incredible who i really loved i was maybe 20 and took a one-way plane ticket to peru to go off in the jungle by myself and however long it was going to take to be with myself and do the things that i needed to do and it was really important that it was a one-way plane ticket and that i said goodbye to everybody and [4307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4307.44s)

that i didn't bind it and one of the there were a lot of very powerful things that happened it was very good that i gave myself that not everybody needs that at all i i did because i had a lot of heroes that were monastic when i was young or you know something like that but one of the major things that i saw [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4328.64s)

that brought me out of it was that life had really made this perfect [[personal development]] ashram for me and i was just rejecting it because i had this idea that i was supposed to do this monastic thing and i'm like actually when i was in relationship and when i was in work i was getting confronted by my triggers all the goddamn time which were my own lack of [4351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4351.76s)

wholeness which is exactly what i needed to work on but rather than embrace that as my development i had some idea of no no spiritual looks like this other thing and i need to go do this and i'm like actually it's kind of easier to not be triggered out here and it's also kind of meaningless and there's certain kinds of growth that i just can't get out here [4368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4368.32s)

and there was a deeper embracing of uh kind of all of life as a developmental path uh rather than being separate so yeah yeah yeah i was gonna um like mention like the monastery is your world type thing or the world's your monastery and then each thing is a forcing function to to improve and develop i i want to sneak [4394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4394.719s)

in another question in regards to the um the wisdom gym uh margaret and i were kind of like we're collecting all these different practices and we're thinking of having like multiple taxonomies or meta systems to kind of organize them um and and for the psychology of [4410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4410.84s)

practice that might form in the wisdom gym do you have any you personally use or any recommend maybe descriptive like meta systems or frameworks maybe like ken wilbur wilpers like growing up showing up cleaning up um and ones that might like systems that might help negotiate what practices to do [4432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4432.64s)

uh at any given time yeah i think the wake up grow up show up cleanup model is a nice model um i found that this specific type of methodology matters less than someone's connection to the therapist if they're working with someone um if your therapist says they're doing [4474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4474.64s)

gestalt or cbt or jungian work they're really just a person that has a lot of experience and if you feel like they have an embodied wisdom around things you're working on and you feel like they grok you then what happens there will be beyond whatever the method that they claim they primarily do is so [4496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4496.719s)

uh as far as working with somebody goes i think the feeling of right connection is pretty important more important than a model idea of appropriate method and then one person that you're working with might be relevant for a while until whatever that is completes and then something else is you just have to be careful when you [4522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4522.48s)

feel a sense of completion is it actually completion or is it now we're getting to the stuff where they're pushing on something i really don't want to see and so i'm trying to get rid of them um so you know that's just the depth of earnestness in our own inquiry um and similar to that i would say there's one can have a model of okay [4543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4543.76s)

well i did this lectical assessment on myself and i'm in this level of complexity of development therefore these types of models are the most appropriate meditation or psychotherapeutic process so i'll do it i'm not saying those considerations are worthless but paying attention to what your experience and a different practice is and doing [4562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4562.88s)

the ones you feel called to is also pretty important um i think if you're doing a practice and it doesn't feel resonant it doesn't feel like anything's moving you can give it if if you've heard really good things about it you can give it good face attempt for a long enough time to see if [4580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4580.239s)

it clicks but it you're also going to get more movement out of something that you do because you feel resonance with it so basically i'm saying i wouldn't try to formalize it too much right yeah that's been my intuition as well and sometimes it's actually critical to pay attention to something that is [4604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4604.08s)

experientially meaningful that you don't cognitively understand and where it's actually critical to not cognitively understand it you're somebody does a session with you with crystals or chakras and it's like actually profound and you notice that you're not triggered by anymore you're like but i don't necessarily believe in crystals [4622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4622.96s)

you don't like it's easy to say okay well for crystals to work it either means that it's a placebo or it means that it's some electromagnetic effect based on the crystalline structure of the molecules in the lattice well maybe not maybe it's a whole other set of that you're not that's in your unknown unknown set that you can't [4642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4642.32s)

conceive of properly so it's okay to say i don't necessarily believe in a specific proposition of how crystals work but i believe in a meaningfulness of my experience that i'm letting myself have and so i don't have to become across the light of a specific way of describing it that doesn't make sense to me but [4662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4662.48s)

because it doesn't make sense to me i also don't have to reject the experience sometimes it's important to let yourself have an experience that feels meaningful and you'll understand it progressively more later i like that a lot someone joe's on the chats uh you don't get to choose what ends up working um [4684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4684.08s)

all right so let's uh sneak in one more question before the hour uh hannah you had a question i do thank you thank you for teasing me um so i would very much like to start bringing some of the tools that i'm learning here to some of my other communities and relationships and so i'm wondering uh [4711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4711.92s)

what what skills can i work on interpersonally interpersonally to start facilitating or moving towards meaningful conversations between tribes so something else are a meta thing i'll comment here is this whole format is just weird this this format we're doing i appreciate it i think [4754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4754.96s)

um i i hope that people feel that there is some uh value in it it was a experiment for me and it was for um peter i didn't feel like saying yes to sends maker in residence to speak on some topic i've spoken a bunch of times somewhere else um but it felt like since this was live [4773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4773.679s)

and it was a community of engaged people um and inter interested in the intersection of personal growth with meaningful topics in the world a chance to like just talk about what's alive on the personal growth side would be interesting but the like one-to-many structure is strange because there's plenty of people on the call who have [4794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4794.08s)

wisdom on these topics that i don't have and yet we have an hour here together whatever it is um i'm glad that there are many other uh people that are contributing to this place and i i imagine i hope that you guys have people like diane hamilton and zach and um maybe verveiki and other people that have worked with people for a long time have a lot of depth of experience that are part of an advisory council that is ongoingly contributing i imagine that's the case but normally if i was having a conversation with anybody here one on one i wouldn't answer questions typically like the question having you just asked me the first thing i would do is ask you [4835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4835.199s)

back what is your sense on that what are you working on where do you find that you have limitations in that currently and yet that doesn't scale to being able to talk to when there's hundreds of people and trying to say what about this question might be relevant to everybody so just even as a meta point [4851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4851.679s)

um a question straight to an answer is usually not the best method of either learning or healing but the it's nate the nature of the format if you're interested in actually facilitating i would say pay attention to which methods you're going deepest with and getting the most benefit from [4876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4876.32s)

and actually see if they have programs where you can learn how to be a facilitator many people learn at a certain point in their life how to be a therapist of a particular kind not because it's their dharma to do therapy forever but because they're deepening their own knowledge and practice of it [4895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4895.199s)

and oftentimes if there's a pattern that's really deep for you and you work with a lot of other people who have it and seeing clearly and objectively the way it shows up in them you get deeper and deeper insights into it um so yeah you might actually decide to take practitioner training and then as far as bringing it to [4917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4917.28s)

different communities and what skills you would develop other than just the practitioner ones the ability to translate reality tunnels or translate ontologies can be very interesting now it's just a kind of like cognitive philosophic thing that is not necessarily always relevant but if [4936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4936.96s)

you're wanting to bring some experiential phenomenological thing to a rationalist community that maybe doesn't have a doesn't even have antique entities for those things right like um then being able to translate it in a way that can relate to something they do have a relationship to uh and then kind of on board just the [4964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4964.639s)

willingness to explore um that can be very helpful and so this is like the skills i would say are twofold one is the ability to say okay well what is this kind of ontologic worldview what is this one and how would i translate them and that's kind of like a communication clarity process the other is an empathy [4982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=4982.0s)

process of being able to see what are the people here actually interested in and what are they open to and how do i connect there i don't know if that answers at all what you're asking would like to follow up hannah i don't think it does answer it but i think you've stated why and some methods for moving forwards anyways and i am satisfied by that fairness and i believe that is uh the time here right peter yep uh we're gonna land the plane now uh any any closing thoughts uh for us daniel i'm also curious uh maybe something you can mention later [5040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5040.08s)

but anything you're interested about this community in particular these sessions um that might inspire some questions for us for next time yeah i think i'm particularly interested in the people who are called to reimagine the future whether it's the future of homelessness or agriculture [5065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5065.84s)

or economics or law or whatever it is or all of them together you know [[game b]] some kind of new world the people who really care about that and want to think about it and work on it and find community of other people who do and who recognize that not just their cognitive learning but their development [5085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5085.44s)

in other ways is part of that because they they want to already become citizens of that world right they want to notice the the non-[[game b]] resonant things in themselves having been conditioned in this world and work to like become inhabitants of that world so they can sense it better and help bring it about [5102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5102.48s)

um i think that's a that's a necessary and particularly beautiful intersection and so what i was interested in here is people who are considering the big picture and considering some of the difficulties of how do we transition with [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and with whatever and then what happens in me that decreases my capacity to be effective [5127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5127.84s)

with that or that could increase my capacity the intersection of the like what do i work on in myself to increase my effectiveness in my being of service to this larger thing that we're all here on how do we address the [[metacrisis]] i think that is what i'm most interested in with this community what i'm most [5150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5150.0s)

hopeful about and specifically more questions in that vein would be what i'd be interested in doing addressing in our last time speaking together great so i'll probably send out a survey with that frame and we'll get some questions in for your last session uh so daniel thanks so much for coming to the stop once again we'll [5169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5169.92s)

see you next week um i will make some closing announcements uh but first let's take in tyson because uh right after this uh we're going to stay on the same link and there's going to be rap unbattles that's going to be led by tyson flows so tyson if you can kind of unmute yourself and [5188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5188.32s)

plug that sure thank you yes in this same room we are going to be engaging in the third version of rap unbattles which is a new experiment here at the stoa where we repurpose freestyle rap and the concept of rap battling but instead of trying to like make our point prove ourselves right [5208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5208.639s)

win over the other person we take freestyle rap and use it as a way to engage and inquiry together practice good faith dialectic and ultimately build communitas so i've really been enjoying it and i look forward to seeing you here very soon awesome uh and uh after i make some closing announcements we'll just take a big [5228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWfyOU07vgE&t=5228.56s)
