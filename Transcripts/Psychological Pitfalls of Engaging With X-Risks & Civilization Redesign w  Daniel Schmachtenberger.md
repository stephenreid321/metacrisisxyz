music times all right everyone welcome to the stoa uh our friend daniel schmuckenberger has returned uh he was here last week with a really awesome session on the health index uh and uh today the session is called the psychological pitfalls of engaging with x-risks and civilizational redesign [34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=34.48s)

uh i'm super jazzed about this one and i imagine a lot of people at the stoa are as well if you recall a couple months ago we had a symposium at the stoa on the [[metacrisis]] a lot of people came in talked about x-risks suffering risks uh and uh effective altruism you know they talk about kind of burnout from engaging with this type of stuff [56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=56.559s)

we had someone talk about embodiment and exorus michael smith came in so i imagine a lot of people have a lot of cool thoughts about this and so how today is going to work i'm going to take in daniel in a moment and daniel will share his thoughts on the the topic at hand and then um we'll pivot to q a so if you have any question anytime [76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=76.96s)

during the um today's session just put your question in the chat and i'll call on you you can ask your question to daniel if you do not want to be on youtube just indicate that and i'll read your question on your behalf um so yeah i'll take in daniel now so feel free to share your thoughts my friend and uh welcome back to the stella [95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=95.2s)

all right good to see you peter good to see everybody it's fun seeing everybody's face turn on as the uh music plays um yeah this was a topic peter and i were discussing and there was there's nowhere else that i would really share it because it's not even a well-formed set of thoughts it's [116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=116.399s)

a handful of observations um that kind of present themselves maybe as a useful topic for community inquiry and community dialogue so obviously the nature of broadcast doesn't do dialogue all that well so i'll be sharing kind of the things that i uh think are at least seeds for a conversation and then maybe something [135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=135.52s)

will happen in the space if it's interesting to explore further specifically what motivated it is um i've had lots of people reach out to me some from the still community others from just kind of watching podcasts in general talking about the [[existential risk|existential risks]] [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] that they have been paying attention to are working on and um the mental illness that has come from them for working in the space um and the extreme difficult interpersonal issues that have come so like i just see this a lot also people who are working on it from a psychological disposition that is [175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=175.12s)

clearly going to be less than optimal it's not quite problematic and so i just there's things i've seen a lot and i thought it'd be worth talking about so this is for basically world-saving endeavors in general anything kind of frame that x-risk is a bit unique like the possibility of [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=193.84s)

uh homo sapiens gone or all hydrocarbon life on earth gone or something like that frames up world saving in a very unique way [[catastrophic risk]] in general even if not full [[existential risk]] the grid shuts down or massive [[climate change]] just disrupting all coastal cities or whatever they're it's a unique kind of thing to [213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=213.76s)

focus on but even the topic of how do we make a fundamentally better so and what does the future of a high-tech civilization look like the scale of these things is not really a human scale right these are not things that evolutionary history would give us any scale for or even the history of local [230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=230.879s)

civilizations and getting things wrong because of scale issues of grandeur um psychologically issues of overwhelm having a hard time with your agency matching it like there's just the the scale and the consequentiality and the unprecedentedness and all of those things are create for [249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=249.599s)

a situation where there would be a lot of reasons to not be attracted to want to pay attention to the space and those who are attracted sometimes have things about them that are strange um and then also engaging with it has interesting effects so i thought i would just mention a handful of things that i've [267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=267.68s)

experienced working in the space people that i've worked with and things that i've noticed came up for me as i worked in the space and to pay attention to by no means will we be doing anything like a comprehensive list so take these almost more as examples of like the types of ways to think about how psychological dispositions relate to how one comes to a space and then also the nature of being in a space how that affects someone and then how the ongoing kind of process of their psychology effects can do in this space but you know i'll i'll probably cover the tiniest percentage of the [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=305.12s)

total space of things worth looking at here before we get into what happens working in x-risk and uh civilization design and what however one wants to call it uh i wanted to start by what what are some of the strange psychological dispositions that can attract one to the space that are not ideal [332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=332.32s)

that you can watch for and everybody you know everyone can have shadow elements so you're in a place like the stoa cause you're interested in looking at this um so i'm speaking to people here who i'm assuming are earnest in terms of having a real motivation and earnest about wanting to look at their own [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=352.0s)

proclivities and see how to integrate heal upgrade themselves compensate for things like that there are obviously some people who come to any space for reasons that are mostly just weaponized and i'm not speaking to them here uh though i might be speaking to you of noticing them [373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=373.36s)

um you can imagine why a topic like [[catastrophic risk]] or [[existential risk]] would be a very interesting one for people who are interested in power of different kinds more than their desire to really prevent it or serve life i have a friend who helped set up a lot of the x-risk community who told me of uh [395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=395.36s)

some of the billionaire class that was donating early on one in particular very strategic said really it's just a recruitment strategy for him he donates to the space because you know super smart people are attracted to the space and then he can recruit them into areas of [[exponential tech]] um like in the in the uh for profit section [416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=416.639s)

and so you can see someone signaling their interest for a reason other than what it is someone wanting someone running a kind of uh military contractor type organization wanting to see what are the best distributed red team scenario planning people can do to then be able to actually win at the [[arms race]] rather than try to prevent it or just any space that starts getting attention and having some because of the attention power associated will always be a honey pot for people that are seeking attention and power and want to signal and ladder climb so uh that thing happens i don't assume that i'm speaking to any anyone who's doing that because there's usually some self knowledge of that i'm assuming i'm speaking to people who have what most of us have all the time which is that they're different facets of self and um i was just seeing if this comment was saying my connection was bad no okay [480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=480.56s)

um there are different facets of self that have different motivations for the same thing it's very common someone will have a motivation to uh from a deep part of themselves to genuinely serve and protect life uh motivation in the cognitive domain to want to learn about interesting and important things uh an interpersonal motivation to want to work with good people on an important topic where you feel camaraderie uh some unresolved ego places that want to feel seen and recognized for doing important work some unmet needs that need compensated you know it's like there's going to be a number of things coming together so what [516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=516.0s)

we're going to look at is some of the ones that can get in the way that are worth noticing and i think it's worth saying we you know like a conversation like this could be had about any profession there are psychological dispositions that attract someone to be a police officer or a doctor or a politician or whatever um and then there are psychological effects of working in that space obviously some of those are really important like how do you attract highly empathetic and compassionate people to the role of a police officer how do you keep them highly empathetic in the presence of the thing that they're [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=552.48s)

paying attention to and that they're experiencing all the time like that's that's a real issue huh what is the effect being a doctor of the malpractice issues and liability issues that you have to deal with to not lose everything and have your family lose everything and simultaneously the fact that you're [568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=568.32s)

overworked radically and don't have time and you're dealing with dead people all the time and like so the the types of um psychological professional hazards and weird attractors in the space are not unique to the space i just haven't worked as a police officer or a medical doctor actually i don't have much to say about those [585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=585.92s)

those are more established fields so that there is more kind of known in terms of professional psychological insight and help for the established fields and uh specifically i think there the still community or at least some portion of the stowe community is interested specifically in these topics of how do [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=607.839s)

we design a different future and both from the positive side of how do we participate in designing a better future but also from the negative side of it seems like there are really shitty futures that have high probability how do we prevent those and design a better future so insofar as people are paying attention to that and they're here rather than in [624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=624.399s)

some other forum because they're both interested in that and interested in their own [[personal development]] to be in better service to that and hopefully also relational development so that they can work together that's why it seemed relevant so with all that preface so if you just think about [646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=646.64s)

what types of weird psychological dispositions that might be problematic could attract someone to the space of looking at [[existential risk]] and [[catastrophic risk]] in the first place you could probably just start to guess them if you haven't already even noticed them right uh so there's a bunch of things that have to do with fear [667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=667.92s)

um someone's fear of uncertainty and fear of just bad happening can of course attract them but where there can also be distortion because of that fear that has them weight everything through an anxiety lens and there's this very interesting symbol grounding thing where it's like if you feel let's say that i have a [689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=689.36s)

bunch of unresolved fears of the unknown because i had a traumatized childhood where at any moment my parents could behave erratically and messed up ways and so i just had hyper vigilance develop well i now have an embodied sense of anxiety and hyper vigilance not connected to anything free floating that i've just projected on and so things that look negative like they could go bad still true to me because they'll resonate with my existing feelings that have nothing to do with observing reality but old stuff i haven't resolved if i see a different scenario where things look possibly secure or good it won't feel true to me it won't land as true [725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=725.92s)

i'll be suspicious of it because i don't have those feelings so there's a place where there is a feeling of truth no matter how logical someone wants to be because they can always say well that argument looks really logical but i think we missed something where does that i think we missed something come from it [742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=742.24s)

doesn't actually land that's feeling true so i'm going to look at it again versus i hear it initially as a hypothesis and i'm like that's the hypothesis i want to go study and see if i can verify because it feels true so i think people underestimate no matter how logical they're being how much the symbol grounding the [758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=758.8s)

embodied feeling ends up being a huge part of it so fear of the unknown and general fear of uncertainty making me want to be a forecaster so i have more certainty about the future and fear of negative things happening this is a huge one and fear of death specifically and so then i can project my fear of my own [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=778.48s)

death onto the fear of death of everybody and i'm going to solve my own existential fear of death by solving the death of the world or civilization um i probably don't know that's happening right i probably think no i'm just being very rational about the fact that ai risk is [794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=794.32s)

a very real thing in biotech risk and et cetera and that might also be true because we're complex creatures with multiple parts operating but the uh to be both a lot of what's driving and a lot of what creates distortion this topic of uh that i just mentioned about like fear [816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=816.079s)

of my own death so let me solve civilization not dying can also be like fear of chaos say in childhood family felt chaotic and didn't feel like i could solve that so i'm going to solve chaos in the world the projection of our own unmet needs that we actually feel low agency over and they're too traumatic so [839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=839.04s)

we project them in the world and try to solve them it's unbelievably common right not in this space alone in all kinds of spaces and so this is why the taoist saying if you want to protect your feet from rocks better to get shoes and try to cover the world in leather um all of those things around why your own psychotherapeutic healing [864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=864.0s)

work is important is because all of you your knowledge of science your knowledge of cognitive biases and logical fallacies and your unresolved traumas and interpersonal issues and fears all of you will come to bear and how you assess and how you act on the situation and so as much as you want to develop [884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=884.72s)

your cognitive abilities and your knowledge of the technological stack and your knowledge of how to do bayesian forecasting and other types of good you know confidence margin calibrating forecasting you also want to work on clarifying the grounding and the psychology of it as much as possible another thing i've noticed is there's a there's so many people who [909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=909.519s)

just really don't think about catastrophes that much at all they're thinking about positive things um or if there's negative oh yeah i know [[climate change]] whatever it's a bummer but their mind doesn't keep gravitating their mind gravitates to what is near term or whatever there are some people whose mind gravitates to [927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=927.68s)

real negative things and gravitates to it so much they can't not try to think about it and figure it out and then if my mind gravitates towards those things so much that i don't just think about [[climate change]] or [[species extinction]] or nuclear risk but all of them and try to think about x-risk as a whole category [945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=945.68s)

there might be a disposition to focusing on the catastrophic that is worth looking at in cbt cognitive behavioral therapy one of the main uh dispositions that messes people up psychologically that they tell you to look at is what's called catastrophizing right and in your own personal relationship he [966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=966.399s)

didn't call me back it means that he dumped me he's gonna die doesn't love me anymore whatever it's like you just going worst case scenario with some tiny little thing and it obviously leads to huge amounts of interpersonal stress and anxiety and i think it was mark twain who made the quote uh i've suffered a great many [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=984.48s)

terrible things in my life a few of them actually happened and the idea that almost the great greatly terrible things that i suffered was a i made up in my mind that still suffered from so the disposition to catastrophize it's quite possible if someone has that disposition they're smart and they got some analytical skills or [1008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1008.959s)

whatever they might actually be quite good at forecasting bad scenarios and be a good risk analyst whether we're talking about for a military application or financial risk analyst or ex-risk analyst they might be better than most people at being able to think through all the bad  that could happen [1026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1026.0s)

and then how to think through theory and solutions for how to address it this is actually a good a good thing of like how a particular trauma can actually have a gift in it and this is most of the time our traumas and our gifts are connected right like whatever difficult stuff we went through uh often sensitizes us to issues that we [1047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1047.199s)

weren't sensitive to otherwise often in the process of of healing it we come up with some skills that are useful for the world so this is very common but it's also true that if we don't heal the trauma the lingering trauma messes up the gift we might have a really awesome gift but it continues to have dysfunction and self-sabotage and [1067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1067.679s)

whatever associated and so we want to take the gifts from whatever bad conditioning or trauma we had and heal it enough that we're not still suffering with the trauma but have the gift so let's say i have a dis disposition to catastrophize as a result i can red team the out of your project are you the [1090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1090.64s)

700 different ways that it can fail from nth order um that's quite helpful to think through so that i don't have to actually fail from all of those things you know like being able to anticipate them put some probabilities on them see how we would test that that's quite helpful the question then is let's say in order to achieve any big thing like okay how do we create protection against weaponized drone attacks on infrastructure i can't do that by myself it's going to take a team to do that it's a hard damn thing to do how are we going to harden the electrical grid against emps and carrington events how are we going to create a closed loop [1130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1130.0s)

[[materials economy]] that addresses [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] their i have to work with a big team very well to do that now does that same catastrophizing having me catastrophize my relationships where i can't trust anybody because i assume that everyone else is either going to make the wrong decisions because they don't [1149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1149.44s)

understand everything as well as i do or they're actually badly motivated well seeing where people are badly motivated is a huge part of doing extras well right being able to see the the [[game theory]] and being able to see where people cause problems by accident which is externalities unintended externalities [1169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1169.28s)

so if i'm really good at seeing the [[game theory]] and the externalities can i also not apply that when that's the wrong tool i'm like amazing at swinging hammers but now it's time to cut and i'm still swinging hammers um so the best tool is actually totally destructive when it's not time to use that tool [1189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1189.44s)

and if it is a tool that becomes a disposition right so if you want to do really hard work of this type with lots of people you have to be able to develop very high trust relationships so then there's a question of do you have capacity to do very high trust relationships that and catastrophizing don't work [1206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1206.559s)

together well also there's no solving extras that is that means anything without being an optimist in some way like i there's a kind of pessimism i need to think through all the problems but there's a kind of optimism i need to think that could be a constructive pursuit at all and that we could actually solve them [1226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1226.4s)

and that when i look at the overwhelming face of all the  that that i think about how to actually overcome it and it's almost like there's an optimism that is a choice that says i'm going to look for solutions period maybe i fail maybe i die looking for it but i'm not going to move into the compromise i'm not going to ask are there solutions or not it's a wrong question i might get a bad answer to it i'm going to say what would it take to solve this let me understand the design criteria enough what would it take to solve it and then so i'm committed to find solutions and not get stuck but since i [1267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1267.6s)

want them to be good solutions that i can believe in as a most naive optimist not a naive optimist right a post i go from a naive optimist to a cynical pessimist to a post-naive and post-cynical optimist right you have to get to the post-cynical phase that's [1283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1283.52s)

critical um so i want my optimism to be a post-cynical choice that i'm going to keep looking for adequate solutions and ultimately that i trust in the bigness of the unknown possibility space that there might be  i just haven't thought of yet so i'm not going to come to the certainty there are no solutions false certainty [1304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1304.48s)

about negative stuff is one of the biggest problems right the holy wars were all fought over people's certainty right thing um nobody really does great acts of atrocity in uncertainty so if you have to decide which side to air is that i'm certain there are no solutions okay well then we just have to radically depopulate because that's the [1326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1326.48s)

only thing or or i'm certain that ai is gonna take over okay so we have to figure out how to upload our consciousness to the cloud so we're gonna justify some really up experiments for a while or how to whatever it is so you can see how when somebody has a a false certainty because they couldn't [1342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1342.48s)

possibly know the whole possibility space of stuff that's in the unknown and yet they preclude there could be no possibility there then they start looking at bad possibilities in so there's this post-cynical optimism that then uses cynical pessimism to red team the solutions to make them better right not to throw them out but to make [1364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1364.88s)

them better and so i'm going to come up with why they might not work so that i can come up with solutions to solve that um so if somebody is in the naive place that doesn't recognize how hard these issues are and how much uh how much actual [[game theory|game theoretic]] nonsense as they are even in the space of people [1387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1387.84s)

supposedly working on this and etcetera you're just going to fail and you'll move to this next space soon if one is in the cynical place there are real upper bounds on the kind of trust creation and the kind of design solution you can really do so there is a post-cynical place one must be in to be post-cynical authentically you have to know that there are other people who are post-cynical because if you're cynical you think trust is impossible trust is something that naive people do right you think the way machiavelli would talk about it and so you think oh whoever i trust the most is who i get the most by so whoever doesn't know who the sucker in the room is is the sucker [1430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1430.0s)

um there is a kind of trust that is post-cynical where everybody knows [[game theory]] because they're like whether it was this or not i'll use it as an example right we can see the way the kathar's all decided to die together to in service of this thing we can see the way the founding fathers when [1454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1454.24s)

they're writing the declaration of independence and signing their name no they're all signing to be killed if the british catch them uh in terms of sedition which also means they're signing to be killed if any of the other guys defect so what they're doing is saying i trust you enough that i'm that i trust you under duress to not defect on [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1472.08s)

this kind of thing so um any decent rebel alliance uh or fellowship of the ring or whatever has to be post-cynically grounded in a way where there is a transcendent loyalty to the cause that we know each other share which makes a transcendent loyalty to each other uh and so you can't catastrophize your relationships right you can't bring trauma into those relationships and have that thing work you obviously have to not be stupid you have to use really good discernment but good discernment means not projecting old patterns it means clear of old patterns actual discernment i might want to come to the space of x-risk [[catastrophic risk]] or even just i'm going to solve sdgs or whatever kind of world-saving proposition just purely for the ego reason if it sounds like the dopest thing to do like what are you working on oh you you're working on a local homeless shelter that's cute i'm i'm actually gonna save the world uh you're solving cancer i'm solving the ability for anyone to ever solve [1538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1538.08s)

anything ever again because otherwise it's not going to be able to happen right so if i just want to one-upmanship my way all the way to the top i'm solving the world um and so you just have to check that right like um ego has a role in life we we have individuated senses of self it [1558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1558.88s)

has a role if one doesn't have transcendent experiences of connectedness to everything that are not mediated through words and mediated through their name and mediated through being a human with a gender and a language if you don't have a transcendent experience of that that includes but transcends the ego you need to work on that because you can't actually do the right kind of work only from the ego place ultimately without this biosphere i'm nothing at all so if my but my ego doesn't include the biosphere hey what's in it for me how do i get ahead whatever and yet i don't exist without all the stuff that i [1597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1597.2s)

depend upon that isn't included in my little sense of self which means i can harm things that i depend upon in service of this little myopic thing and so one needs to have a sense of life the inner connectivity of all of it that's actually embodied this is the purpose of any kind of mystical spiritual doesn't require weird [1616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1616.96s)

beliefs it's actually not about beliefs at all beliefs mess it up it's about experience experience of uh consciousness not mediated through the semantic and a transcendent connectivity associated with that you can have that without any beliefs you'll still come back to having an ego come out of that most transcendent [1638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1638.64s)

experience whether it's through meditation vision questing ayahuasca whatever and then you'll still have an ego and so any model that shames the ego and says it's a bad thing we need to get rid of just puts us at eternal conflict with ourselves because it's a dimension of our self the ego is the mind is [1657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1657.36s)

the emotions are so they all have an evolutionary purpose it's just how do we tend to them and integrate them so a healthy ego doesn't the hole for itself right it it actually subordinates to higher self it's an important thing and then in so far as the ego wants belonging and wants esteem and those types of things it wants [1678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1678.72s)

it from things that are actually aligned with its highest values and aligned with long-term interest rather than short-term interest so it's not uh [[hypernormal stimuli]] so if there's a part of me that wants recognition i would it would be better to think about things like what will i feel best that i [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1698.32s)

had spent my life on on my deathbed and how do i want the people who are gathered when i'm dead thinking about me about who i was as a person and who i was to them and how i interacted how i touched them and those types of things that's still ego motive it's just an ego motive that because it is relational and [1716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1716.159s)

because it has more duration ends up being less problematic than just visualizing myself getting the nobel prize or whatever the the um near term less holistic consideration is so you can watch like a way you can tell this isn't happening so like let's say i'm focused on x-risk i want people to be nurses like [1742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1742.32s)

i they're there are people who are going through [[existential risk]] themselves this moment they're they're in the process of dying or about to die or their kid is right and it's like it's it's everything that is sacred about the big picture in a microcosm embodied now and i can't help that but that nurse can or that person who's doing rescue work with dogs in the [1764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1764.32s)

in the pound or the whatever it is like i want everyone bringing that full depth of love to whatever is theirs to do so i can tell if i'm in a conversation with someone do i listen to the thing they're into and get fascinated by it and get proud about it and get wrapped and want to support it and not need to talk about my thing do i talk about my thing in a way that actually makes what they're doing possibly seem less important even to them if so that's an thing i gotta fix music there's and then there's a million things like this it's kind of if i have [1802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1802.0s)

big control issues i might be very interested in designing the future because i want to feel like i have control in the biggest possible thing i could want to have control in um i i want to feel like i can bend the world to my will or whatever it is it very much alexander the great napoleon conqueror [1820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1820.64s)

kind of mentality um applied in this domain like there's a lot to be very concerned about in those spaces um so these are a few things about uh dispositions egoic dispositions trust dispositions fear dispositions the um catastrophizing ones that might attract us to the space but might also mess up how we show up [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1847.12s)

there and so what we would do is say how do i inventory these and how do i work on them what therapists can i work with what practices can i do and also who can i be in close relationship with that i can trust where they can help check me on this and i ask for that and i can help check them on stuff so can we because the definition of a blind [1865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1865.84s)

spot is i can't see it so there's gonna be stuff in the way that i'm showing up where i think that i showed up pretty well and they're like nah you you totally seemed like an arrogant  or um no you seemed really disconnected and way more interested in your own stuff than anyone else i'm like i didn't know [1882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1882.24s)

and so i need people that i trust to give me feedback and i need to want to hear it and i need to make it really safe for them to give me that i won't always agree it might be some of their trigger i should take it really seriously and err on the side of trying to agree and trying it on we can get now into the topic of what happens working [1904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1904.64s)

in the space of having all of your attention on very abstract things very long-term things and all the particularly most negative things uh but i guess i'll stop here and say are there any questions or thoughts at this point on the attractors to the space topic [1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1921.279s)

yeah that's um a lot of good stuff here and we've got tons of questions coming up so let me just uh take a moment to feel into what is the best one to start off with um yuli uh if you can uh be taken in first hi thank you um so which of my questions you're talking about the which organization's question very last [1955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1955.12s)

one uh whatever ones feels alive for you um uh okay i think the most alive one is actually so from a tiny bit of context i think there's not a single thing you mentioned that doesn't apply to me so i i work in the effect of altruism space and i you know when i hear these predisposition uh [1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1978.399s)

predispositions i think about how they're constantly showing up and um it was very difficult for me personally to inventory them properly and to see exactly how much work i should be doing on improving the various elements that i'm noticing um because again i'm sort of like balancing a whole bunch of stuff [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=1997.2s)

so uh maybe the question could start with like how do you recommend we effectively inventory and i know you touch this in terms of like building high trust relationships for people to point out the blind spots but if there's other easy access tools i think it would be really useful for me to hear about yeah and then any deeper part of the [2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2018.48s)

question might be something like you know there's basically infinite personal growth on some level so any any thoughts you can talk about how to synergistically navigate the balance between self-improvement and application of that which we have to offer would be really appreciated yeah this is uh awesome reflection so how you inventory other than asking other people stuff you can do on your own take frameworks take maslow's hierarchy of needs and in each of those say what stuff feels insecure or unmet for me there and how does that show up in my disposition where do i have unmet stuff [2062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2062.639s)

around belonging or around esteem around feeling self-actualized around feeling secure and then just say where does that actually affect my motivational complex if that was addressed would be different where does that become a hook of different kinds and so it's an example of a framework you can apply you can apply the seven deadly sins honestly and say okay so where is pride where is um greed where is you know it's things like that coming in and just as a framework you can take chakras and the chakra system has a metaphorical system for types of emotion thought and capacity is [2103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2103.04s)

a good system so um i i can explain that one later it actually it would take a while to explain all of them but if it's a familiar one for you uh so just take frameworks that look at the dimensions of a person right the dimensions of a self and do an inquiry around it [2127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2127.04s)

that's one way another way notice where your stress is and inquire into what's what the internal dispositions are that create that stress not the external circumstances but so in a very much in a byron katy way if you aren't familiar with that work cbt or whatever so get the book loving what is by byron katie and uh watch a few of her videos so it's a simplified method of cbt but that's actually quite good that looks at if you want a more erudite version start with krishnamurti's writings on the topic but he doesn't give you a very practical thing he just shows you how much what you're [2168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2168.24s)

observing is the combination of observation and narrative um the evaluation or narrative continuously and it's happening so fast and subtly that you don't even realize you're narratizing and you think that it's objective observation and which is why he said the one of the highest stages of human intelligence is to observe with no evaluation [2188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2188.16s)

which is really hard so you can take that and then be able to say okay because four different people might be in a very similar circumstance and have very different emotional results one of them gets angry one of them gets sad one feels scared one feels ashamed one feels excited one feels proud based on the [2206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2206.96s)

[[meaning making]] so the exploration of human [[meaning making]] narratizing events and then our emotions responding to the [[meaning making]] is huge uh it's like probably the area the the biggest lift you can get of any area to work on first has to do with noticing the patterns of [[meaning making]] and shifting them realizing that you actually have a genetic process over it i think byron katie's work is the work that kind of made that simplest pragmatically for people so wherever you're feeling stressed about something you're having mistrust in relationships with people you're [2244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2244.64s)

feeling overly pessimistic you're feeling overly concerned about all the things that exist in the unknown then you can just look at what are the core beliefs underneath that because the stress i'm having with this person feels a lot like a hundred situations i've had in the past like this right this concern about the unknown now [2262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2262.72s)

in biorisk is a lot like what it felt like when i was doing nuclear risk whatever the else it was and so it's like okay it's not really about the topic it's about the way i'm relating to the topic so what is the underlying generative unconscious belief that is being the that is a [[generator function]] of narrative here and it's it's something like i can't trust anybody or in order to be safe i need to know what's going to happen in order to be safe i need control or whatever right like these kinds of things so you just notice where is the stress and then you notice what is the narrative that the video camera can't see because i it's me narrating the what the what the video camera sees the video camera is doing third person i'm doing a second person thing on it right and then what is the generative belief that would have me narrated that way and narrate a thousand other videos in related ways [2318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2318.24s)

then how do i work on that belief that's another way um another way is you look at where you have had the greatest failures and blockages in your work including the ones that you blame on everybody else i'm not saying you do i'm saying one and try the experiment of if i take 100 responsibility for that failure even if it was other people were such and such why did i not have better discernment about that better structuring of it better whatever it was if i uh because otherwise what i'm saying is i have learned nothing and i'm completely unempowered and like [2364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2364.48s)

feeling scared about the world or disappointed about it or resentful of them is all i got and so if i go through something i want to say could i go through it again differently and better well i only can if i learned something i could do differently so look at the areas where you've had the [2381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2381.359s)

most challenge the least success the most disappointment and say if i take 100 responsibility for it what what are the patterns and how i showed up that contributed to it going that way that if i did it differently differently maybe the people would have behaved differently maybe i would have i would have behaved differently to them maybe i [2404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2404.24s)

would have picked different people maybe i would have whatever right when you say there's an infinite amount of areas for personal growth starting with wherever the failures are biggest taking responsibility that the failures have more to do with your psychology than one thinks [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2419.92s)

i think failures have a ton to do with the psychology of the person going in where the same skills and capacities they have with a different psychological disposition could be applied much more effectively um and and starting with how do i work on the psychological dispositions that i can [2441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2441.119s)

identify as having a at least partial causal relationship to where i get stuck the most that's a very good way to like focus on where you're going to get the most leverage out of the work um and then there's a thing around having experiences where you really have [2463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2463.599s)

a sense of i am not my current identity i'm more of the transformative process because there's some continuity of self from when i was 5 and 15 and 25 and now and i'm a totally different person i went from being a liberal to a conservative to an a trans political i went from being having views on this to this i changed [2484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2484.4s)

my religion i changed my what the am i that is different than all these beliefs different than these skills and capacities right now i'm super identified with this role in these capacities but i was identified with other before i'd ever thought of any of this stuff and so if you realize in 10 years i might have totally different capacities hopefully do totally different dispositions etc so more than my current state the process that is seeking to evolve that is seeking to grow and become and that it's also specifically seeking to take responsibility for failings and areas of [2522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2522.0s)

weakness and heal them means i'm not that area of weakness i am whatever kind of deeper care and love is willing to integrate and shift that and i'm not my current skill set and whatever deeper kind of value and love will develop new skills that are useful wherever it is to be of greater service so if you take that on seriously then [2540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2540.4s)

you are welcome criticism about where you are currently because it's not actually criticizing the essence of you it's criticizing a particular developmental state that you won't continue to be but you will only get to transcend it if you see it and so then there's this place where it's like i can look [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2558.8s)

compassionately satan like oh wow i didn't realize i was doing that that makes perfect sense do you have any guidance on how i might fix that i just asked peter the other day for guidance on you know peter and i were talking and i said are there any ways that i've showed up in the stoa that suck [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2578.16s)

that seem like they're not that great or helpful and particularly we there there was a conversation where somebody said something to the effect of that uh i i mansplained something to them and i'm like did i do i do that um and it was interesting because i'm like [2600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2600.96s)

sometimes i get criticized for saying things that seem too obvious and people already know and they're like come on give me some  credit but even more often i get criticized for using terms and phrases people don't know and assuming they do know the and being like dude you have to explain [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2618.4s)

the stuff more and i'm like i i don't know how to calibrate um and i need some help here so i asked peter and he's like well if you're gonna explain some stuff that maybe people know but you aren't sure if they know and it is um still helpful to clarify because you want to make sure you're on the same page just preface it every time and say [2638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2638.4s)

this is you probably already know but i just want to double check times i'd do that but after we had that talk i will do it more now um and so but i reached out and asked him right and and continued to kind of ask until getting an insight on it so this is a real valuable thing is finding people who you are asking to give you feedback [2661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2661.839s)

it's kind of like a guy who doesn't want his partner to give him any feedback on what she likes in bed because his fragile ego wants to already think he's a great lover is actually going to be a shitty lover and a guy who's like actually seeking feedback will become a much better lover and so it's there's a self-fulfilling [2681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2681.04s)

prophecy either way if i want to be seen as good i'll actually be worse if i want to be actually good i want to know where i'm not right uh so there's this just like really seek the input and the last thing i think i can say on this is um was this video that i watched it was so beautiful i was i watched it a little [2707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2707.2s)

while ago a couple times i cried both times i think it was leo sillard as an old man like a 90 year old man being interviewed about the early quantum mechanics days and all of the founders of modern physics and what it was like and and there was an affection with which she was speaking about von neumann and [2729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2729.28s)

einstein it was just super touching and the guy asked him the interviewer said who was the smartest of all the people doing uh modern physics and he's like no question it was johnny vaughan and everybody knew it was johnny bunga i mean clock speed no no no comparison and none of us were even tripping about it because it was there were no close [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2748.72s)

seconds and he kind of went on about how great he thought johnny von neumann was then the interviewer said so does that mean that his contributions were the deepest and then sillard sat back and he said no that would be mr einstein and he got teared up and he's like there was something other than clock speed [2767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2767.68s)

that einstein was doing that made his insights go profoundly deeper and even and he's like i didn't know what he was doing at the time and i've started to get a sense of it and even johnny knew that and it this is all of einstein's quotes about intuition and creativity more than just intellect and those types of things and that it's an optical delusion of [2791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2791.44s)

consciousness to believe there are separate things there is in reality one thing we call universe and like there was a set of there was a mystical but really a set of psychological dispositions that took time right it took time of him wondering what it was like to be liked in a very deep way trying to get a [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2812.48s)

first-person sense of what it was like to be a photon and trying to get a sense of i want to know god's thoughts the rest is trivia he took a lot of time in something that didn't seem all that useful in terms of chalkboard physics that also gave him deeper insight so i would say the psychological work that you do if it brings you into [2830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2830.72s)

greater wholeness the ultimate nature of reality is that all of the reductionism is useful and false it requires us trying to make models of reality that aren't reality that are useful but they aren't actually yet and all of the x-risk is actually driven in the way boem talked about by a fragmented world view [2851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2851.28s)

that optimizes parts at the expense of other parts whether it's the rivalry of china at the expense of the us or vice versa or this metric at the expense of this metric driving externality there is a wholeness that has to become the psychological disposition if we are to make it through the amount of tech power that we get and so any of the [2868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2868.319s)

places that have unwholeness in our self are actually like the work there makes us a citizen of the future and if we aren't a citizen of the future we can't help build it i very very very much appreciate all that i'll quickly reflect that i'm like noticing a ton of super useful things even in this moment right talking about the [2889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2889.44s)

relationship between how i am seeking more certainty how that's actually feeding into the narratives i'm playing out in terms of like yeah i spent a bunch of time at a buddhist monastery and then i'm out here you know sort of taking more action i'm like how do i even bridge that why do i flip flop [2902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2902.559s)

between the two why aren't they uh finding synthesis what is that how do i navigate that so there's a lot of beauty here i also see there's a lot of really good stuff in the chat so i'll learn to uh i'm 29. okay so i was still in what felt like flip-flopping between those things at 29 [2921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2921.52s)

and it was somewhere in the 30s that it felt like they braided and the flip-flop for me was um like three things there was the [[personal development]] part which both looked like monastic impulses and monastic ventures at different times but also a lot of psychological work and though that was my primary focus at [2942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2942.88s)

certain times there was the study of how do i understand what's going on in the world and that was science philosophy economics whatever to know how to work on it and then there was  i actually have to help stuff now there's really critical going on and so there was an activist impulse and the activist impulse was also critical [2961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2961.2s)

because if you don't get real one if you can stay not helping there's something wrong if you stay fully in abstraction and in the actual work you get so much grounding about what it takes to organize people um i forget who it was i think it was von klausowitz some quote about uh you think you're a really great general try organizing a [2981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2981.28s)

beach trip of 100 people um and just see how hard it is to organize people for a really basic thing and so in trying to do like even small scale 100 person activism to help a forest you you learn a lot that is relevant to the most abstract scale so those three and it drove me [2999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=2999.92s)

crazy because i'm like this needs all my attention and i always felt the stress of there's not enough time because just i can't do the right activism if i don't understand these things but i also can't do it if i have the wrong psychological dispositions and aren't coming for enough clarity and but i have to help the stuff that's currently happening and with the stuff [3018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3018.16s)

that's happening do i focus on the animals or the environment or the poor kids or the and it was when i finally recognized that the the wholeness of reality is the basis it is both my own connection to the wholeness it's my cognitive respect for that wholeness that seeks to [3038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3038.48s)

understand it as best i can knowing it'll always be inadequate and it's that same impulse that doesn't mean we want to serve life in all the different forms and that those are actually not competing with each other for time they're in a virtuous cycle that the development in each of those areas develops the other ones and when you hold it as they're in a virtuous cycle it helps looking very much forward to more of that practice thank you daniel awesome thanks julie and it's funny julie and a bunch of people from tri yule's from toronto and a bunch of people from the effect of altruist movement they went to the [3073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3073.28s)

monastic academy to stay there for a bit so perhaps you can come to the story youth and we can talk about the intersection of what you learned there um skyler brown you had a question on embodiment uh i think that'd be a good follow-up hi daniel hi good to see you it's so good to see you um yeah so the question arose earlier you were [3097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3097.52s)

talking about embodiment and um and it brought me to a question about intuition and you and i have talked about this before and i wondered if you could offer some um from your perspective the use of intuition or or right relationship to intuition and then pitfalls [3117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3117.839s)

um and then it came up again when you were speaking about einstein it was such a beautiful i was very touched by that story um really touched by that story and it made me curious um in a way what was einstein doing yeah that's my question and i think let me just add this little piece in case it comes up [3143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3143.839s)

um there's something about the nonlinear ways of knowing that you know whether it's intuition or dreams or whatever einstein was doing i would love to just hear a little bit about that i don't know peter if you've had ian mcgill crest on to if he'd be great to have come on uh [3172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3172.0s)

master in his emissary and talk about the work he's done in deeper understanding of right hemisphere left hemisphere the functions they have the relationship between them uh it's directly related and and probably the best work on the topic i'm aware of can i just daniel let me just say it's so funny because i just wrote down right [3192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3192.24s)

brain um reggie rey he talks about the somatic eye and he's calling the semitic eye is a combination of the heart the [[nervous system]] and right brain and i've read that book um but amazing your intuition was spot on right there i we could easily do um a holster a conversation around what is intuition how does one develop it what is its relationship with rationality is there a distinction between in intuition and instinct where can they be trusted where can they not like there's a whole lot here and i guess what i'll say briefly is that i [3243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3243.68s)

think of intuition mostly i'm not going to say 100 i think of it mostly as a epistemic capacity that can be developed um in the same way that i think of rationality as an epistemic capacity that can be developed and everyone does rationality but they don't all do it [3270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3270.24s)

well because they didn't develop it they didn't learn to think about what are my axioms what is the basis for those axioms what are my step my logical steps and is this something where induction is appropriate where abduction is appropriate you know logical fallacies critical thinking cetera so when someone is training science and they're training math they're training formal logic they're training rationality to work well and it takes a ton of training because there's a lot of places where it can go wrong i think it is possible to train intuition but it's a totally different set of trainings and i think [3308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3308.64s)

just like most people's rationality has them rationalize a bunch of nonsense um i think most people's intuition is very largely their unresolved biases magicking themselves up and so it's a lot of like fear desire and preconditioning saying i have a sense of that and the sense is just the projection of unresolved stuff [3330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3330.24s)

and that leads one to catastrophize if they had you know uh hypervigilance creating childhood and say my intuition tells me something's bad here well your intuition is because you have a bunch of unresolved stuff you're projecting onto every situation and so but does that mean you should gaslight yourself and not listen [3346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3346.559s)

to your intuition ever because that ends up being where you get into trouble when you really had a sense of something well this is why you have to develop it right um one of the main ways you develop the intuition is by clearing the unresolved unmet needs that create a desire and the unresolved traumas that create fears that make you not [3366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3366.16s)

actually quiet enough and that make you project past situations and unresolve stuff onto this that you can actually connect to what's going on currently right like that's a huge part of it so i think the more trauma healing that happens and the more meeting of needs so there's less [3383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3383.839s)

unresolved need the better one's intuition becomes um that's oversimplified what was happening with einstein i i have a big pet peeve around anytime someone takes a phenomena and then tries to explain in words that sound science-y what's probably happening neurologically or whatever where it's not actually science we didn't actually do something to verify that as a theory it's a hypothesis and then it's being presented with excessive certainty so i'm going to give you a hypothesis of what might have been happening it might be mechanistically totally wrong um so let's say the left brain left hemisphere and this might not even relate to the left hemisphere all that much right might relate to some other neural networks or other so like i said mechanistically this might be wrong so take this as a as a reasonable sounding model say that the left hemisphere corresponding to rationality more orients itself in the nature of the [3442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3442.96s)

neural networks to serial process more than parallel process and so our conscious mind can think through things in a kind of linear way so i have this data these are my axioms this is how i do logical transforms these are my conclusions you can give me new input and i can come up with new conclusions right so it lends itself to that let's say the right [3462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3462.48s)

brain has a different type of neural network orientation that lends itself to parallel process more the parallel process can't be isn't a sequence of thoughts that are happening simultaneously it's a pattern analysis process of okay i have a thing here and i'm holding i'm holding it up an other than conscious process to all of my previous experience [3482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3482.88s)

to see where does a pattern arise and so then i get a aha kind of out of nowhere because of a parallel processing type dynamic and so intuition often arises as a intuition in aha out of nowhere that we could think of as a kind of pattern matching which is why people's intuition tends to be better in spaces that they know [3503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3503.28s)

more and there was a talk i watched where the dalai lama and eckhart tolle were speaking about this and i thought it was quite good and they were giving an example to the effect of neither of us when we go into the power of now or kivalia or whatever you want to call it come out with the equations einstein would come [3523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3523.04s)

out with why is it because if we're just accessing the akashic records and it's all there we should be able to ask the dalai lama what the cure for cancer is or the solution to the bad guys nuclear codes or the solution to unified field theories we come out with it except that doesn't happen [3538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3538.48s)

the guy who goes in with physics comes out with physics the guy who goes in thinking about how to solve this suffering of sentient beings comes out with better insights about that the person who goes in as a very good athlete comes out more in the zone and does better athletics eckhart said something like i'm not going to kick the soccer ball well from the power of now or out of the power of now or whatever but the really good soccer player if they access that does a better job because what they're accessing is increased wholeness that is taking what's already in them and processing it differently and so it's making more connections [3570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3570.839s)

within the self and i think that is i don't want to constrain it to say that's the only phenomena that there is no non-local whatever kind of phenomena but i think that's the main way to think the best way to think about most of it which is most of the ahas are recombining [3591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3591.76s)

thoughts and insights and experience i already had with new patterns and insights that i wasn't aware of that wouldn't come through just linear process they come from a different kind of state they can do a different kind of parallel process and then that insight i don't take automatically as a verified truth now [3611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3611.839s)

that enters into a left brain process that says how do we verify that and then i take the insights from the left brain process put them into a state where i can see new patterns so so the einstein process of work on the whiteboard until on the map until he got to a block and there was no more real progress happening and then go puff his [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3634.319s)

pipe look at the clouds and and have some meditative process and then aha would come go back to the whiteboard then you'd get to diminishing return and go back there that's exactly this kind of flow between a serial and a parallel type process between a analytic and a synthetic right analyzing [3651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3651.839s)

looking at the parts how they fit together synthesizing looking for deeper patterns that connect it all but those happen through different modes of mind so we need to condition or modes of self we need to condition those different modes million more things we could say but hopefully that is [3669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3669.839s)

something thank you awesome thanks skyler um daniel you're good for another 20 minutes uh yeah um can you mention briefly the risks not the psychological dispositions of coming to the space but the what happens working in the space yeah i won't take long with it i'll just [3693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3693.839s)

highlight it and it's probably obvious see this is me applying what peter taught me last time um it's it's probably obvious to think about all right if i'm a police officer where i'm just focused on areas of high criminal behavior i'm not seeing the whole of the human condition with an equal distribution [3716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3716.16s)

right and is that going to affect my psyche in certain ways and how would i compensate for that well if i'm focused on let me forecast let me look at all the data of everything that's getting worse let me continuously look at all the data of everything that's getting worse and let me forecast all the ways that humanity could destroy itself and blow itself up [3733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3733.76s)

and also let's look at all the ways that we aren't doing a good job of solving it what's the psychological effect of that um especially when you see when you're trying to do forecasting and you start to see things that look like timelines oh we only have x amount of time before a runaway effect on [[climate change]] occurs and if or we only have x amount of time before autopoetic agi occurs or whatever it is that can create a sense of urgency combined with maximum theoretical consequentiality combined with a need for a and also low agency that can make someone crazy can make them desperate make good things uh i have seen all of this [3777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3777.039s)

it can have someone in order to stay kind of and look at everything in a very detached way and actually kind of disconnect their emotional self like oh yeah in this scenario it's actually not really existential because only two billion people die and and maybe actually the two billion [3799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3799.76s)

people dying version is what makes us last long-term because there's a population problem and and so to not be destroyed by it become sociopathically disconnected well that's a problem to not be sociopathically disconnected if i'm really sensitive how the do i handle thinking about it right and not just be crushed [3818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3818.799s)

question of how do i develop sensitivity and strength resilience at the same time the strength not not numbness but the capacity to feel that and hold a wholeness of self in the presence of it and that is again psychological or spiritual whatever you want to call it work to do cognitive it's all those [3844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3844.96s)

dimensions um you're working with looking at risks where the more people would know about the risks they could actually possibly make it worse the topic of info hazard so you have to not share certain stuff so you start getting into domains where you're thinking about why it's important to not be honest all the time that can start to have very weird [3867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3867.039s)

um it can also start to particularly if you look at the dispositions there are some people who just really like to feel like they're on the inside of cloak and dagger like we know special stuff that's going on and other people don't know and like there's some ego appeal to that um you can tell if someone knows info that they really think is [3890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3890.96s)

safe not to share they usually won't even say that right but if they're like oh that's an info hazard there's some mystique that gets made about them to even say that thing that's actually less good for classifying the information so you know there's weird stuff that happens whenever you're working with the [3909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3909.28s)

topic of things that are important but with but where you're looking at the rational risk of not being honest and all i would say is like just aware of it and there must be some people inside of circles of trust you can be honest with and you must also kind of just watch what is how is this affecting how i show up with [3927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3927.28s)

people and in relationships is is the justifying when not to be honest bleeding over into other areas where it shouldn't bleed over myopia is one of the biggest ones because it's hard to keep in awareness the rest of the universe that i'm not paying attention to when i'm paying such acute attention to [3952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3952.72s)

one part so i will weight that those parts heavier than they are so it's very easy to become certain that we're about to be destroyed it's already too late because i'm not also looking at positive features i'm not also looking at progress that makes things possibly better i'm not looking at where surprises occur when [3971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3971.92s)

people were like oh there's no way we could beat the speed of sound or we could this or whatever it was or create lift and it happens and so just the preponderance of data in my attention will affect how i feel um all i have to do is go to a youtube page that has curated videos of police violence and particularly say [3995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=3995.68s)

police violence towards people of color and just scroll the page for half an hour and i'm and outraged and like horrified just because of the preponderance of stuff coming in it feels like the most catastrophic thing in the world then i can go to a page that is curated of police taking kittens out of trees [4015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4015.92s)

and going into burning buildings to help people and whatever and it's amazing how much i know this right and my emotions change with just a preponderance of a particular kind of sensory input that's just a half hour of videos and i know the stuff so what happens about like if i'm [4032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4032.88s)

working in the space all the time how do i also stay connected to positive futures positive possibilities beauty of life now where i'm not trying to save the world i'm actually in service to the beauty of the world um it's a very different thing so there's a lot more things like this but you can just recognize how susceptible [4052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4052.4s)

we are as people to being over focused on some areas and not all of them to thinking about risks that are so huge and that matters so much but that we can't actually take full agency for how hard it is to emotionally care and not feel like you can solve it and the problems of both [4072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4072.88s)

getting just crushed or emotionally disconnecting and just being aware of these things and be like okay so it's hard so that's something to work on so how do i work on it authentically and i think that uh would set up uh evans uh davidson cutler's question um just to [4092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4092.96s)

preface it evan and i have been talking a lot about the medic crisis and how kind of the still is uniquely positioned um because we're at the intersection of like basically all three of the epistemics they're at play at the stoa not only we're talking about the uh [[existential risk|existential risks]] and suffering risk but we're talking about embodiment and doing [4110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4110.08s)

all this kind of shadow work and stuff here um so yeah i'll let evan ask this question because it's related yeah thanks peter and thanks daniel for coming on today this has been great so far um yeah just briefly uh peter outlined the beginning of it quite nicely but the stoa is in quite a unique position [4127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4127.6s)

um given those three modalities to be i think quite impactful here and and it's been experiment experimenting with quite uh a lot of different psychotechnologies as well as sort of developing its own sort of ecology of practice and various psychotechnologies and so i'm wondering if there's anything that [4146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4146.319s)

stands out to you in terms of how the stoa could be best deployed to culture a ecology of practices or develop a sort of psychotechnology toolkit in the space that would assist individuals who are working on x-risk very interesting question i mean i think the first thing i can say [4171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4171.679s)

is i like the idea of it doing that i also agree that it's in a good position to do that uh it would probably actually be worth doing a small design call to see for the people who have good thoughts on that to come together and contribute i think that would be a [4192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4192.64s)

valuable thing so that the [[collective intelligence]] of the stoke community gets to help create the answer to that um couple thoughts i would have to think about it longer but a couple thoughts that come to mind right away we did a talk here one time on this set of questions i wrote called dharma [4213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4213.92s)

inquiry um you can if you search the stoi youtube you'll see it and there's a link to the questions and they're questions designed to help someone feel into what they care about most what their positions are what might be different if they felt more capacitated [4233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4233.199s)

and towards like what does look like for them i i think right path doesn't look like directly focusing abstract topic x risk for almost anyone very few people where the right path is to focus on the abstract topic of x-risk for some people focusing on a specific x-risk like [4254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4254.719s)

cyber security attacks on infrastructure like they that by itself needs tens of thousands of people focused on it who have real skills and someone might be like i have the software skills i can focus on that thing or nuclear or they're they're a biologist and they care about bio risks right now so for most people they're not they wouldn't [4276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4276.08s)

be focused on the abstract category of x-risk like that's mostly people who are kind of philosophers who like the category theory and like abstractions of that type combined with thinking about [[social system]] design and whatever and so some people should and then there's also a lot of like before we start talking about extras and [4297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4297.52s)

[[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] we're talking about that there's extreme poverty in the world and there's still up wars and warlords and ex there's there's a rampant torture in the world i was just talking to a woman who runs one of the biggest organizations that works on on torture and she's like they're the torture today [4314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4314.159s)

is mostly hidden but because of population it is way worse than it was in the dark ages like the total global torture happening and um so a lot of people's dharma should be working on those things a lot of other people's dharma should be creating beautiful art and beautiful sci-fi and whatever about a future that is [4334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4334.239s)

desirable that could be as an attractor for where people can go a lot of people's work should be developing psychotherapeutic capacities to help people who are working on these topics so one thing is don't assume that the topic that seems like the most urgent one is the one everyone should be focused on because it that [4354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4354.0s)

that is itself myopic right all the things need done one way of talking about what do we need to do is a world where everyone is doing their their dharma if everyone is doing what is actually theirs to do that maps to what needs done is happening so one thing i would think about the story doing is not just assume [4370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4370.0s)

that people should be working in a particular space just because they're interested in it because they might not have had support finding what is actually a better calling for them um and so then what is the right psychotherapeutic and cognitive and professional and relational support for them in the domain they should actually be in [4388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4388.88s)

that's one topic music and then in terms of things like for people who are working either in x-risk as an abstracted category or domains of it or even torture issues like all of those have in common facing issues that are too big for an individual person to take responsibility [4409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4409.36s)

for hopefully motivated by compassion and love and there's like a crushing emotional effect of just staring into it so it doesn't have to be x-risk it's just really trying to solve anything that's huge and really matters uh where is there like can we create a space where people can process what is most alive for them [4437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4437.44s)

that is their overwhelm their existential angst their devastation their fear of death whatever um process it in a way that doesn't have them have to just pretend but also doesn't have them get stuck and get support moving through it can we work on developing a group of practitioners that are really good at some of those things in a group of [4458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4458.08s)

practices that are really helpful i think things like death work where people actually create peace around the topic of death is pretty upstream from a lot of it actually peter i have a friend named anne-marie keppel who i think should come on and talk about that who does exceptionally good [4474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4474.8s)

work in that space um i think getting something like byron katie's the work and there's a couple refinements on it that you can make i would be happy to suggest the refinements uh and being able to have a tool like that that becomes kind of a community well-known practice on how to be able to separate what's objectively happening from the meaning-making that's affecting how we're holding it and do a better job working with our own [[meaning making]] i think i think you guys had alania forsberg on she she developed a process she refined a process from the psychodrama tradition that she calls the golden bowl [4518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4518.4s)

um that is maybe the most sophisticated nuanced process i've ever seen for giving people feedback about their blind spots in small groups in a way that they can actually really hear it's given in a way that is both very direct and also very loving and uh yeah i just think it's a really beautiful process [4541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4541.04s)

to do that and where people could come together either here or with their own groups of five people or six people that they're close to and be able to have something like every month we're doing this thing there's something about feedback like that that also has continuity with the same people over time because then you can see is someone actually [4561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4561.6s)

taking the feedback taking responsibility and changing it or not because if if people give me feedback and i'm like oh yeah wonderful thank you and then next month i'm still doing it next month i'm doing next month i'm doing that i might just be full of and not like taking it seriously and so it's it's helpful to be able to have uh [4580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4580.0s)

continuity in practice of that kind so yeah these are a couple initial ideas but my my bigger recommendation is there are probably a lot of people i mean skyler does great psychotherapeutic work with people there are lots of people in this community that do uh get some design sessions together [4599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4599.92s)

also get people like the gentleman who was talking earlier from the ea and x-risk communities to share what they observed they'll go much deeper than what i just did and say like here's what i experienced myself here's what i observed these are the problems so you get a map of what would actually [4617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4617.199s)

use support that is grounded in terms of what's happening in the space it's a great response thank you fantastic awesome um yeah we gotta get some people doing some golden bull here at the store uh um last question perhaps uh jeff d uh jeffy has a really cool blog called doomsday parenting [4645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4645.199s)

and his questions related cool hi daniel um so i mean i think it seems to me that like if you're a parent um you're you're in the x-risk business um kind of automatically uh you're a thoughtful one and yet yeah well and yet i'm finding that it's it's it's difficult to get parents to to [4669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4669.6s)

really talk about this stuff or talk about it's touchy to talk about parenting at all with other parents so um you know i was just wondering if you had any ideas around you know how do you properly raise children without either lying to them you know by shielding the worst [4691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4691.36s)

realities from them which they kind of deserve or passing along on unfair you know world-saving expectations because that's also unfair um or or am i or am i missing something is is there some some way to surf in between those i'm not a parent i don't have the answer [4711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4711.36s)

to this i have a few thoughts but they're obviously not tested uh i might totally psychologically ruin my kids i i think i wouldn't but who knows um so uh there's i don't know if you ever had um a woman named miriam on who does uh parenting work with people [4732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4732.48s)

you have i would ask her that question i really love the way that she thinks about the process of being honest with kids and also developmental appropriateness shelley lefko also would be really quite good she does brilliant parenting work that addresses similar topics and [4756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4756.88s)

specifically the method that her husband developed is kind of like a more sophisticated version of the work in terms of a cognitive behavioral shift process but that so she took it into parenting to say how do we raise kids without dysfunctional beliefs in the first place but not just what do we think is a good [4772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4772.56s)

belief but how do we raise them to have awareness and agency in their own belief formation process uh those would both be good interesting ones and given what you're doing jeff probably good friends to have um i i do think there's something about developmental appropriateness of what is someone exposed to relative to the capacities and agency that their [4797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4797.84s)

[[nervous system]] has at the time um uh a little kid who if their parents weren't there wouldn't survive they would definitely die without their parents is not actually an autonomous being yet right it's not a agentic being it's a dependent thing and so exposing them to big issues in the world when they can't even take care [4818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4818.719s)

of themselves probably just creates a kid that is mostly terrified and hyper vigilant forever rather than uh prepares them properly at the same time having them be in a complete bubble and then see the world where they have such a stark break is a challenging thing so there's a titration [4841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4841.44s)

there's a developmental to what level do i expose them and i think zack stein would also have very good things to say about that from a kind of neo-piageti and developmental psych perspective in terms of how do we expose things that upregulate their capacity in a way that is relevant that is related to the [4873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4873.92s)

upregulation capacity they actually have uh something like if you're in the gym there's a kind of pain that's good in the kind of pain that's bad the kind of pain that is muscle soreness is good the kind of pain that is like joint injury is bad so it's is this is this a thing that i actually is a stress that i can upregulate in response to or is this a stress that something is just going to get broken in response to is a very deep question for everybody honestly but particularly for kids so i would mostly defer this question further to the people that i think know it better than i do thanks yeah i think there's something [4912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4912.0s)

about the the high end of that of that spectrum where it's like the there's always been a question around how how do you explain to a child what the dangers are in life it just seems like this particular set of dangers is is novel and i think this is where the [4930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4930.639s)

conversation hasn't been robust enough in parenting but i appreciate your uh your thoughts and sources i will say one thing on it is that i think what parents demonstrate is much more important than what they overly say and this is why being a parent is actually a forcing function for doing your own [4950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4950.88s)

developmental work if you don't want to pass your on to your kids and so a parent that is engaged in challenges of the world the kid gets to see oh this like when you're walking with them do you pick up the trash when you're walking with them how do you respond to the homeless people the [4970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4970.08s)

people that look upset had like do they get to see not you telling them something but do they get to see an embodiment of compassion care responsibility you know those ethics and then what is your work is it ah another day at the job can't wait for the weekend or is it someone who is on fire to do meaningful things [4987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=4987.04s)

and then if they see that you're addressing real issues in the world with passion but you also feel empowered and what they're learning is your emotional state of empowerment as opposed to either apathy or overwhelm or anger or frustration they should also see you have emotions right they should see you sometimes feel [5008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5008.96s)

sad or frustrated but process it responsibly so they aren't learning to be sociopathic they aren't learning to hide and then break and commit suicide they're learning that to have healthy emotional processes and process them in functional ways that lead to being able to stay [5026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5026.719s)

connected to their values compassionate and empowered simultaneously and that dialectic of what you could call feminine and masculine qualities if you want or whatever of of compassionate sensitive caring attuned and strong resilient empowered that those are always coupled [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5045.84s)

and so i would say you can tell them that but mostly you have to demonstrate it and they will get that by osmosis but in the demonstration of it no that's great and good job for not being even for not being a parent for what for not being parents even though you're not a parent yeah awesome um so we're close to the bottom [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5071.76s)

of the hour and we have a fun event coming up soon um so daniel any closing thoughts you'd like to leave us with here at the stoa today i hope this has been interesting and useful and i know probably every time somebody talks you guys have a whole thought of what the stoic community could do to advance [5093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5093.44s)

that topic and there's probably a a backlog that is bigger than the organizational capacity and people's time to respond to all of it if it happens that um those parenting topics increase i'll be happy i think those are super important if it happens that the death topics get worked on i think that would be great if it happens that the how do we help [5114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5114.8s)

people not x-risk in particular how do we help everybody in here find their own dharma better and then how do we help them with the resources relational cognitive professional psychological to do better in that dharma that would be an amazing thing right for a community to be able to help people both find their path and walk their path better and i think this is already oriented that way but the idea of that is a kind of like central design intention to keep developing and to create better [[collective intelligence]] process where anybody who has good things to offer to that can and they can be harvested somehow [5150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5150.639s)

obviously that doesn't look like something that peter can synthesize all that and run it himself that you know um and especially on largely volunteer basis so i'm not sure where that goes but whatever way it could go i would love to see that beautiful yeah um i just feel excitement [5169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkItTnRJ_1M&t=5169.92s)
