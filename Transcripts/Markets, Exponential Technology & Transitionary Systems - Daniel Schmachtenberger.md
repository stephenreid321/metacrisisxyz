hey everybody its eric torborg co-founder partner of village global a network driven venture firm and this is metro stories a podcast covering topics relating to tech and business with world leading experts hey everybody welcome to another episode of venture stories by village global i'm here today with a very special guest daniel schlotkin berger daniel is a civilization designer interested in [28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=28.89s)

social architecture and if you listen to the episodes of jordan green hall and jim rut you will love this episode then welcome to the podcast thanks for having and good to be here i want you to sort of give people a bit more of who you are and what you spend your time thinking about so i want to ask a couple of variations of a similar question and you can answer whichever one you feel most [53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=53.55s)

inspired to jump off from the first variation of it is woody how did you sort of when you define think about the work that you do what sort of threads it together what sort of the underlying thread that you just keep pulling or an another very that's looking back and another variation of the question is looking forward what are the current questions that you are most wrestling [74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=74.88s)

with you are spending your most time on trying to trying to figure out and hope that you know many years from now when you were retrospectively looking back at the the work that you've done hope you've you know taken a stab at or or made a dent in in in terms of your contribution sure i think one way of talking about the central thread is how do we best help improve humanities [98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=98.4s)

wisdom the way that we individually and as various groups and all the way up to collectively make sense of what is important and meaningful what's going on what the what a good design our strategy to serve what's meaningful without causing other problems is and how do we make choices and coordinate joyce's effectively towards a better world of the initiative world and so basically [127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=127.649s)

all of the sources of unnecessary suffering and particularly human induced unnecessary suffering kind of all or intolerable to me have always been and there's a lot of them right everything from the animal rights [[species extinction]] [[factory farm]] stuff to environmental devastation to untoward that could have been solved for other reasons that have economic [155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=155.34s)

incentives and whatever to to the escalation of those with increasing population and technology and globalization and fragility that looks like catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] and given that they there are so many that they're really unsolvable at the level of each particular instance i have been interested in not just how are they interconnected but what is underneath [180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=180.48s)

and driving why humans are behaving in ways that generate those problems and that don't solve them and so you know you use the term civilization design which is if we look at say [[species extinction]] [[species extinction]] whether we're talking about the decrease in whale populations or cutting down of old-growth forests or whatever and whether we killed the theme for the [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=203.37s)

direct commoditization of it or we killed the habitat land it was because nature was worth more dead than alive so we had a [[perverse incentive]] situation we can see a lot of situations where war is great for gdp and not war would be bad for gdp we're sick people are better for gdp where addiction is better for gdp where and gdp as a whole in an aggregate or particular groups and so we start to [226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=226.95s)

look at oh underneath lots of problems in the world is [[perverse incentive]] economic but also political etc so issues associated with differential power and the ability for some agent to get ahead at the expense of other agents or the commons and then everybody playing those types of games up ratcheting their capacity to get ahead at the cost of more expense being [247](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=247.5s)

externalized and you're not just talking about short term versus long term gdp you're talking about this fundamental misalignment at times between what's best for long term b2b or what's best for long term you know civilization well interestingly what is best for long term consideration and what's best for others often times correspond because i might have a situation where what seems like [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=270.45s)

the rational best choice for me in the short term that ends up damaging the commons or others also damages my possibility space in the long term because now i live on a ecologically devastated planet or now i've engendered more enmity from the other groups that i won the battle but have not won the war and i deployed the asymmetric technology now they reverse engineered and are [293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=293.7s)

gonna deploy it back so we have these situations where every agent doing the thing that seems like the rational best choice in the short term just focusing on them creates the worst possibility space for the whole over the long term so this is an example of the like [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] that are underneath most of the problems in the world i don't want to cut all of the [314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=314.7s)

trees down and i don't need to but if i don't the other guy's going to so me not doing it doesn't leave a forest and then he's gonna use his increased economic power to beat me in some other important ways so now we actually race to cut it down as fast as possible or do we see tragedy of the commons type scenarios or we have to race to build the ai weapons before the other guy so [[arms race|arms races]] tragedy of the commons are examples of [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] where no one is maliciously doing the bad thing and yet everyone's racing to do the disruptive things i think they start codecs called this moloch yes the meditations on moloch is required reading yeah and so you know you asked me before we started talking how i discovered your work and i mentioned i would crypto rabideau would [357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=357.24s)

let me do the gaming rathole and i discovered you know a few years ago sort of this literature around progress and and tyler cowen and his book stubborn attachments and how you know improving economic growth and gdp and technological progress was the you know highly correlated with so many things that we we care about you know in firma tality healthcare i mean so so many [377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=377.91s)

great things about the world and you know i read things like you know geoffrey west scale where it said you know says that economic growth is inherently unsustainable you try to innovate your way through it but you know that you'll reach some limits but then i read things like andrew mcafee's more from west's where it says hey you know we've now decoupled resource [400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=400.54s)

consumption or resource usage from consumption and i don't know who to believe right now that no to believe but who's right which do we get to innovate through it is the only way out is through or do you have to sub you know have this radical reformation of how we how we run our economy more charles eisenstein stuff and so that's my question to you then how do you think [422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=422.56s)

about that yeah so let's talk about limits of growth and upper bounds and that kind of question so obviously the growth of the [[materials economy]] and the domain of atoms is different than in the domain of bits and we would be silly to not acknowledge that fundamental difference and there's a third difference in terms of the physics of the [[materials economy]] the domain of atoms the domain of energy and the domain of bits all have fundamentally different scarcities and different thermodynamics associated different conservation laws so we have two different accounting for them we have a finite amount of atoms of various types and of course via better mining technologies whatever and turning the atoms and the molecules for better [470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=470.26s)

chemistry type technologies we can modulate that to some degree but we also have upper bounds on that it's also important to realize that it's not just getting the atoms that's what do we do with them after the fact which is the waste management so for the most part so far humanity's had a linear [[materials economy]] where we take resources out of the earth in a way that are not renewing [488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=488.83s)

themselves which is a ultimately causing net depletion and then we use them for some time a period of time and then we put them back into the earth in a way that they can't actually be reabsorbed properly so toxicity net accumulation the depletion and accumulation in the ecosystem where the ecosystem before humans doing a [[materials economy]] had closed-loop process as the the animals [512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=512.05s)

the plants the fungus is that everything in an ecosystem are made of the same atomic ingredients and can be fully recycled and so anything dies and it becomes food for new things and the food for new things doesn't try to figure out how to mine and get like savings accounts in very effective ways because they don't have to lin evasion so you get these kind of clothes we process as [532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=532.18s)

this issue part of the antifragility of how ecology's work so obviously we have to move from a linear [[materials economy]] to a closed-loop economy that's pretty straightforward where we take responsibility for closed-loop on the atomic cycles so we aren't producing accumulation on one side or depletion on the other now we can keep cycling them [551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=551.71s)

so we don't have a situation that once we've used it it's gone right but we do have a situation where we start moving from increased growth of the number of atoms in measuring growth or progress in terms of the number of atoms to that the atoms are being put into continuously more interesting forms the forms are defined by design that is stored in a pattern of bits and obviously the bits [574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=574.42s)

don't have a similar type of fundamental limit to them than the atoms do so atoms we have to think about closed-loop accounting on now to be able to process the old stuff into new stuff atomically takes energy energy has a different kind of conservation to it which is that we get a finite amount of energy bandwidth every day we can use it more efficiently solar and you know other types of things [601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=601.87s)

but we don't have an indefinite amount of energy so we have to be cycling the atoms within a limited energetic bandwidth and we have basically unlimited amount of bit pattern limited only by the energy and atom needs of the computational substrate but then the bits are only useful in so far as they can actually be put into form and or there is limited human attention to be [624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=624.99s)

able to engage them as types of software and so human attention becomes another fundamental scarcity that is part of this equation and so when people look at things like the fundamentally non-rivalrous nature of software you can't abstract that to the domain of energy or atoms right like you really have to think about these in the accounting of them differently the [648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=648.97s)

moment you think about attention as a scarce resource to compete over monetizing everything gets evil and  and hurting as we see in the world with all of the problems associated with [[social media]] type dynamics and marketing because monetizing other people's attention which is obviously at the heart of the idea of marketing right but not just [669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=669.94s)

marketing propaganda in a government way and every the desire to control other people's behavior for personal benefit the benefit of the corporation or the political party or the whatever it is but if i'm if i am a political party or at google or facebook or i'm an advertiser on there and i'm a multi-billion dollar kind of organization employing tools of radical [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=691.18s)

asymmetric advantage to be able to use the most effective [[hypernormal stimuli]] to cause addiction entrapment to you notice all the stuff tristan harris and those folks talk about to people there is a kind of asymmetric information and [[narrative warfare]] for people's attention and you notice that there's no definition of consciousness you can give that's meaningful that doesn't require [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=716.44s)

defining attention or a definition of choice so attention is very fundamental to what it means to be human and what it means to have any kind of sovereignty so using asymmetrically powerful tools to capture and direct and split test optimize how effectively you were able to capture and direct someone else's attention is trying to put any degree of free will or choice they have under your [738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=738.37s)

control for a purpose that benefits you and not them and again as an asymmetric type warfare so we have to stop thinking about the attention economy that way and so now we can start to look at why we think of it that way and what would it take to change the macro economics underneath that so are there fundamental limits of growth yes can we create more efficiency to where those limits are [760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=760.51s)

extending but still bounded yes and so you will get to a place of diminishing returns on the increased efficiency where we don't have increased resource per capita multiplied by increased population on a linear or an [[exponential curve]] forever we'll get diminishing return and so we do have to think about [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] in a intelligent way and do we do we have to think about [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=789.46s)

that in a way that sort of top debt like do we steer the market a little bit or that you know do we have to get involved or will the market sort of figure that out on or solve problems on its own agency we don't have a market so every adam smith type arguments about the self-correcting intelligence of the market even though it wouldn't have been true then and [811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=811.249s)

super not true once you have bank bailouts and you subsidize oil companies and you have monopolistic kind of investments in military manufacturers and things like that so that there's no self-correcting nature of a market there also when you think about fundamental like theory of why a market would self correct you have this idea that humans are going to be [[sensemaking]] what they actually want that provides a good quality of life and that that expresses itself as demand and the demand is kind of the environmental niche if we try and reify this with evolutionary theory refight area of markets devolution in theory the demand causes an evolutionary nation which different providers of products and services that there is a demand for emerge and so the variations [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=856.339s)

and how they make their product or service are kind of like mutation and then some of the companies will succeed in to that survival selection and some won't and then a couple companies that have different ip or a different approach or different market segments might merge and so that's like mate dynamics where you get combinatorial dynamics so the idea is that markets are [876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=876.019s)

like evolution and so there is this kind of correcting increasing complexity type dynamic and of course that people competing against each other to provide the best products and services at the best value to rational agents will pick the rationally best choice is what actually increases the quality of life for everyone this is a cute idea that's obviously silly because there was a meme [900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=900.799s)

going around on facebook that said that the smartest people go to the best colleges to go work at the biggest tech companies to figure out how to engineer addiction for children more effectively and we call this meeting meaningful demand and the self-correcting nature of the market the moment that you can manufacture demand the intelligence of the whole thing's broken and it's [921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=921.11s)

important to understand that supply and demand will have a cemetery between them on aggregate meaning the company that's supplying in the collective body of all of the demand but there is no coordination or intelligence of the click body of all the customers but there is a coordinated intelligence on the supply side so it's really the supply supply [937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=937.339s)

side against a single customer that is an asymmetric dynamic that doesn't have the same good for both of them there's a lot of times where the person doesn't need to buy the new that now they feel like they need to buy for status or addiction or whatever type thing it is it won't actually increase their quality of life in a meaningful way but we can use the supply side can use asymmetric [959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=959.089s)

manipulation tools to get people to want to buy it and also confuse them about what the best product or service is because people aren't actually seeing what the best product or services they're saying what the best marketed one is we can also then use our market dominant position to squish smaller competitors that have a better product or service so it doesn't have a choice [979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=979.399s)

of actually emerging on and on so the self-correcting nature of a market is not a real thing anymore to the degree that it ever was a real thing and i there's actually a deeper argument as to why it never really was but even in this situation the asymmetric ability to manufacture demand that actually breaks the intelligence of demand as the basis of selection is actually a fundamental [1003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1003.37s)

broken kind of situation not to mention then that government's the whole idea of the [[nation state]] or government is to bind or regulate the most predatory aspects of where there would be perverse financial incentives so it'd be very profitable to do crime extortion so we're gonna make a law not to do it would be profitable cut down all the trees so we make laws to say no we're [1025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1025.569s)

protecting state parks but as soon as the regulator is supposed to regulate economic interests but that individual regulator is nowhere near as motivated to be effective at that personally as the economic interest is motivated to break their ability to be effective at it this is the libertarian public choice critique of this kind of [[liberal democracy]] structure representative [[liberal democracy]] then you end up getting a situation where market forces capture the regulating forces through campaign financing through paying all the lobbyists through getting compromising information on representatives through whatever they capture them and then have them actually serve their interest and now you don't even have the checking forces [1071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1071.5s)

of market competition because you actually have the regulator doing the opposite of regulation because obviously the regulator will always be something that we want to try and capture the market in now it's a 210 so it's important to see all the places where the idea of the thing right the idea of what a healthy market would be and what a healthy constitutional republic would [1091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1091.69s)

be and how they would work together you will see like in this nation the founding father said again and again things like this system only works with a comprehensively educated public that understands the history of what governance systems failed and which one succeeded in why so that they don't get compelled into those things it is educated enough to not be susceptible to [1114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1114.28s)

propaganda that if you don't actively engage yourself in civics you're consenting de facto to be ruled on and on there's quotes funding for other quotes i think this one is jefferson if i could either have perfect news and the route trash government or i could have perfect government and trash news i'd take perfect news right because if people will comprehensively educated [1135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1135.61s)

they could reform government not the other way around yeah though we don't we don't have that and so what you can see is that internal vested interest forces cause predation to the structures that were designed to be the best structures they could be and so we've had radical [[institutional decay]] to where markets incentivize predation and extraction more than they [1157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1157.3s)

incentivize meaningful production of the things that most matter and representatives don't represent the people they represent the financial interests that get them in place and governments don't govern for the good of the whole they pay attention to what will get them reelected on for your term cycles and how they figure out to make a lot of money on the very small salary in [1172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1172.6s)

so i don't know if i actually answer your question i said that the underlying myth that there is this thing called a market and it has self-correcting properties is is really important leap gibberish and we have to acknowledge that if we want to think sanely about things that so here's to take a stab at alternatives or even characteristics of alternatives that could emerge in [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1198.34s)

maybe the medium term and so you mentioned the attention economy the problems of that like what's an alternative to that or for exactly and you you've talked to in previous talks about how you know when we talk about regulating a market people get concerned start thinking about communism and that's not really talking about but you've also talked about how you know [1217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1217.24s)

it's not democracy is all sorts of failures with it like you all this isn't that we currently have aren't up for the task or that don't meet the the problems that we currently face so what does or what could yeah so fundamental principle that we have to factor is that any game can be gained the moment you define what the success criteria is and what the laws and the [1242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1242.86s)

whatever there will be places where you can violate the spirit of the law while meeting the letter of the law there will be places where you can figure out how to externalize some cost to something that wasn't accounted for in the model well being able to benefit it the thing that was accounted there will be some place where you can figure out how to have [[plausible deniability]] or hide culpability to be able to get ahead and so it's an important thing to understand there is no such thing as a perfect [[social system]] and there never will be and meaning when we think about a perfect [[social system]] when we try to imagine what that would be what we're usually thinking about is okay how do we remove all the [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] from the system such that no one ever has an [1284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1284.98s)

incentive to do something that is for anybody and how do we make sure that the system of incentives predisposes everyone to make the most on the considerate positive choices for them in the whole in the near term in the long term and what we're actually asking is how do we remove choice and make a system that predisposes everyone's choice in a particular way and as long [1308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1308.169s)

as there is the reality of choices the reality of the possibility of people making choices that are intentionally benefiting the whole but wrong mister [[mistake theory]] or not intentionally benefiting the whole or even intentionally damaging this this is an important concept i'll come back to the more tangible in a moment but i think you'll find [1332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1332.649s)

that if you try to define meaningfulness like the meaningfulness of existence of life you won't be able to find any definition that doesn't bind the concept of meaningfulness to the concept of choice and so insofar as we are we would seek to make a system that actually compels people's choice to be a particular way so their choice is no longer actually choice it's the result [1358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1358.539s)

of the causation of social engineering we're actually trying to make a system that debases the basis of meaningfulness so and i can also say that there will be no matter if i have a system that tries to look at a bunch of metrics not just gdp but i'm gonna look at a bunch of things that are metrics that are uncommon terrible so i'm gonna look at co2 and nitrogen affluence and [1382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1382.119s)

microbiome of the soil whatever all the things i can and factor them into some [[complex system]] optimization waiting function there will always be metrics that matter that aren't included that we don't even know exist yet the unknown unknown set is never factorable into the thing and so there isn't a perfect system this is asimov science as the ever [1402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1402.099s)

writing of wrong there is only progressively hopefully better systems where the failures in the current system get acknowledged and improved but that takes humans that have a kind of general intelligence beyond the system dynamics to notice what's wrong with the system and make choices that the system is not predisposing to make good choices independent of system predisposition and [1421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1421.989s)

to then also work to improve the system so we want to make the best systems that we can we also want to develop humans that make choices not just influenced by but beyond the influence of the current types of social coordination systems so the reason i say this is because what that means is that there is no answer to a civilization that doesn't totally suck that doesn't involve the comprehensive [1447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1447.009s)

education and development of everyone to be good stewards of human choice and any attempt to do something that doesn't involve that will always end up being some kind of propaganda for a system of control and so that's fundamental it's also important to understand that no matter what proposition i offer for anything or anyone offers i can also say how it [1470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1470.92s)

could be gamed so again this would take some people being earnest and smart enough to notice where that was occurring to be able to work with it and bind it so that's a fundamental statement now that's not me answering your question it's saying why that question is unanswerable and a perfected form so i can give some examples of what progressively better systems and the [1492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1492.63s)

writing of wrong are and we can still go into where they would be game about and then what the next progressive step would have to be perfect and i'm also curious even go deeper on how to make but what a good steward of human choice looks like how to make those what it doesn't look like and how we can and i don't know if it's a segue into force landry stuff but how we can how we can [1514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1514.45s)

do that which way do you want to go first proposed transitional systems your choice it's your choice and there with you transitional assistance let's say we're looking at economics as a system that is predisposing patterns of human choice and we think of it that way it's a system of extrinsic motives in scent 'iv to create coordination it's not just resource allocation it's also extrinsic [1538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1538.75s)

incentive right so that we can get people to do the labor jobs and those types of things but it's not just get people to do the labor jobs which is a how do we extrinsic ly override people's intrinsic motives it ends up being kind of a system of incentive writ large and so a dollar or whatever kind of currency is a fungible singular would maximally reduced unit of value for all types of [1567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1567.7s)

value that's the idea so that we can take value whether it's a service or a product or whatever something made out of bits or attention or atoms or energy or whatever it is and we can decide how much it's worth so that we can create exchange between them so we have this kind of abstracted value metric well there are kinds of value that actually matter that are not measurable they're [1590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1590.83s)

not quantifiable there are kinds of value that are not extractable and exchangeable so insofar as value that is measurable and extractable and exchangeable will confer [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage to me over the kinds of value that are not then i can't make decisions that optimize sunsets or rainbows or songbirds or you know future generations [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1618.58s)

of children getting to fall in love or whatever i can't optimize for that because insofar as i put resource time attention energy or physical resources into those things i'm actually losing maximizing my own power and advantage relative to those who are doing purely measurable extractive exchangeable things this is a this is a [[multipolar trap]] issue and it's based on the fact that the metric off' ocation right met relation of value is actually a fundamental problem we have to make choices in service of values that can't be put into fungible metrics so now when we're talking about how do we condition good human choice we can see that very fundamental to something just like the idea of currency is conditioning choice in a way that is not what we would call [1668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1668.89s)

being a steward of good choice that if we look at wisdom from any tradition any kind of good thinking on what wisdom is it would have people make choices that are not fully based on the type of metric accounting so if someone has a [[fiduciary responsibility]] to utilize their resources and they have now quantified the value of other people's lives as human resources in terms of [1691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1691.81s)

their hours and what they get paid and whatever we've quantified you know all of those types of resources and they have to maximize shareholder returns as part of a [[fiduciary responsibility]] they will be obligated to destroy real value in service of the types of value that confer game-theoretic advantage and that are on the fiduciary relationship so this is just one of a lot of examples of [1717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1717.46s)

why you can't leave choice to a system the and yet why it was also very hard to develop humans it would make choice outside of what moloc or the [[paperclip maximizer]] of the system orion yeah there's a version of this in silicon valley which is you know measure what matters if it matters you'll measure it if if you don't measure it you will pay attention to it of course [1741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1741.97s)

problem is that the things that truly matter in our lives we can't really measure it and so there's this conundrum there do you try to find better ways to measure the things that are unmeasurable hoping that you'll then prioritize it and not corrupt it in the process do you just acknowledge that there are certain things that you'll never be able to measure and you need to find ways to [1760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1760.72s)

prioritize it or do you get rid of all metrics altogether and yet that seems exactly these all seem like a perfect solution of course you don't get rid of all metrics but you have a choice making process that is informed by but not determined by the metrics because there will be a general intelligence capacity to look at all the metrics and say there are things that matter that are not [1783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1783.22s)

being captured here adequately and i can understand qualified things that aren't quantified i can understand some quantified things that i just paid attention to that aren't on my dashboard of metrics to look at i can understand that my simplified algorithm is probably actually really wrong that's paying attention to how i did an economic model or whatever it is and so the ability to [1804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1804.73s)

hold responsibility for choice and this is one of the other things is that people actually get out of ethical responsibility even to their their own self by creating a decision-making system that they have to follow when that says troops were being tried in the hague after world war ii and they were being asked about war crimes they were all asked did you believe in everything [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1829.539s)

that you did and 90% of them said no we actually like we started too and then we didn't believe in it and then they were asked did you try and stop and all of them said no we didn't try and stop and then when asked why they quoted the german phrase that said something like officers orders we didn't have a choice so the moment that you say [[fiduciary responsibility]] or company policy or this is what i gotta do to you know compete with the market you can be a nazi right you can actually remove all ethical culpability by saying you don't have a choice so the question was how do we develop good stewards of choice and we can see that it's not only the [[sensemaking]] the calculate stuff well it's also things like it's also things like depth of [1867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1867.56s)

congruency and knowing ultimately what your life is in service to and what is meaningful to you and what matters beyond what any dashboard might be able to represent yeah knowing and here's the difference between virtue and virtue signaling virtue is where there's something that matters to me that is not expressed in some type of [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage it's not expressed in dollars [1891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1891.65s)

or likes or tweets or status or election that i am willing to sacrifice those [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage in service of virtue signaling is using the performance of a virtue that people will care about to get more [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage and when it comes down to the two masters issue of will i actually sacrifice um personal [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage and service of this if the [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1917.48s)

answer is no with some justification its virtue signaling and so this then becomes a core thing and choice is where am i willing to do something that doesn't maximize profits it doesn't mean that it makes me unprofitable or crashes my company right but where am i willing to do something that doesn't maximize profits or slows the speed of growth or doesn't maximize market capture or [1938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1938.51s)

whatever because there's something that i care about that i'm actually committed to that i have devotion to deeper than that thing and if people don't know the answer to that then i don't trust them as stewards of choice at all and is it also being good steward of choice is understanding the power of but also the limitations of the scientific worldview or scientism or that as the main sort of [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1962.45s)

guide for how you make decisions or determine what's what's meaningful or makes sense yeah so just like you were saying do we get rid of metrics or not there's a and the answer is we're informed by but not determined by we're informed by scientific process and methodology but that doesn't actually determine the choice and so when asked to ask what is what is the methodology [1985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=1985.22s)

that is relevant to influencing choice that includes but is not limited to the methods of science because you know we have this classic is odd distinction inside and science can say what is it can't say what odd because science specifically the way you know there are some extensions but the way we think about science in a pop arian sense is it is [2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2008.919s)

the epistemology to study things in the domain of the measurable and the repeatable something has to be both measurable and repeatable to be able to be subject well there are things that are real that are measurable but not repeatable there are things that are real that are not measurable measurable is in the domain of third person and obviously first person itself is not [2028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2028.509s)

measurable you can measure third person neural correlates that and then over norm how well you think they're correlated and use a physicalist assumption to say that physical is primary and first third person was primary and first person must have been a phenominal none of which is grounded in anything other than a self referential assumption so the real is [2050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2050.049s)

not exclusively measurable and repeatable so science is a necessary but not sufficient epistemology so when i'm asking questions about choice making i'm asking aunt questions not just it now they have to be informed by az otherwise they're ungrounded right so one of the problems here is that the philosophy of science gave us so much power over religions and other things to be able to [2074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2074.46s)

understand the physical world and then apply that as technology and engineering to have more power over the physical world so anyone who paid attention to newton's calculus could make cannon balls hit the target way better than the pendulum dowsers could and could do a lot of things so those who kind of paid attention to it just started to win via war economic war or military war or [2096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2096.49s)

whatever was but then what happens is we have a dominant system a dominant kind of philosophic system it says we can't say what a good choice is there is no basis for the there is no reification of the concept of good or the concept of choice both of those are concepts that we don't actually understand so we assume choices summed up causation from particle physics in the brain or jeans [2120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2120.16s)

or whatever domain we happen to study and good is purely a nonsense social construct the best we can do is look at evolutionary biology reo fight with [[game theory]] and say good is that which doesn't lose in a rivalrous context maybe trying reified down to thermodynamics and say who can garner the more the most scarce thermodynamic energy right but that's [2139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2139.42s)

not actually a definition of good in any meaningful way and so good choice is both of the words are outside of the domain of the philosophy of science and yet it's gonna create all the power that empowers the choices that were making through whatever methodology to be more powerful in this win and so then we say okay well if science gets applied as technology which increases our ability [2164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2164.91s)

for warfare and economic extraction and production and narrative control and you know information control and all those things then what is guiding how that technology is implemented well the economics that funds it and so then the economics is basically saying a good choice is the [[game theory|game theoretic]] choice that wins so when you have technology and getting into the phase of [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] all of the philosophy of science empowered by [[game theory]] as its ethical system that system ends up in my assessment [[self-terminating]] because unlike animals that can't increase their [[game theory|game theoretic]] capacity radically within a life that only increases very slowly over over natural selection time periods in relationship to the co selective pressures that all of the other animals [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2220.299s)

in the ecosystem also up regulate predator only gets a little bit better right through a mutation and then at best they start to eat a little bit more of the slower prey which in breeds the faster preys genes which make them get a little bit faster so you don't get radical asymmetries of power which is key to how the meta stability of nature works but the moment we had stone tools [2243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2243.88s)

we were able to increase our creative capacity faster than the amazon then the mammoths could deal with it faster than the whatever and we started extinct tting species and over hunting environments and then rather than having our population come into steady-state with the environment like every other predator we could just move to another environment become the [[apex predator]] everywhere then start farming environments then start mining source and moving to a you know fundamentally net unsustainable type dynamics the tool-making gate which was early philosophy of science right before formalized philosophy of science it was our abstraction capacity mediated ability to understand principles right the principle of sharpness that could [2286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2286.16s)

make a sharper knife not just use a sharp rock and then to test kind of empirically does this thing actually work better our ability to do that broke the symmetry of us with regard to nature and also of the most powerful humans with regard to the other humans and that kind of symmetry is key to what allows metastability of evolution so we're still using an evolutionary motive ie be [2308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2308.809s)

the [[apex predator]] but without evolutionary capacities with capacities undermined by evolution because our capacities are evolutionarily unprecedented no other animal could kill the whole world we can they can't ruin whole ecosystems they can't genetically engineer new species again because our capacities evolutionarily unprecedented the power of our choices the basis of [2332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2332.809s)

our choice also has to be evolutionarily unprecedented because we have the power to influence the whole so much we have to have consideration for the whole in our choice making because our capacity can influence the long term so much we have to have consideration of the long term in our choice making if we keep making choices to optimize our near-term [[apex predator]] status but with capacities that break the entire metastability then we selves terminate yep and evolution is as a terminus concept as a field is used to justify or explain you know lots of different things about how society currently works do you do you have and how people work and why they do things do you have served any different views from the mainstream evolutionary there in terms of how we should interpret [2378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2378.469s)

darwin or or other sort of important sort of divergences that have different implications for what's quote unquote natural or or appropriate or irrelevant for us it's a big conversation there's lots of things in here and the idea that the mainstream thinking about darwin that was just individual survival of the fittest without considering symbiosis or [2404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2404.48s)

ecosystem dynamics like that critique is now i would say fairly well known by anyone that's paying attention and that if you look at an ecosystem and you look at the relationships of gas exchange between plants and animals and all of the food cycle dynamics and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the soil and you see that most of the things are actually very codependent interdependent you know [2425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2425.27s)

symbiotic it happens to be that the the competitive things just stand out in an interesting way right when when bucks are you know budding antlers it just obviously stands out and it ends up being that of course really focusing on that whoever really focuses on that and wins wars those memes get selected for and so in the same way that you know genes that have certain camp dominance [2452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2452.01s)

get selected for so do memes even if they aren't actually holistic or true or you know in that sense so there's a there's a lot we could talk about of not just looking at individual animal selection or individual species selection but selection at the level of whole ecosystems that's really critical because obviously if an individual species got so successful relative to [2471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2471.74s)

the other species that it depends upon that it debased the ecosystem that it depends on its own short-term success would kill its long-term success and this happens right like we've seen invasive species come in devastate an ecosystem and then they're gone and so the only things that make it through long term are the things that lead to self stabilizing ecology's but when we [2494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2494.359s)

don't pay attention to that part of evolutionary theory when we are justifying being the [[apex predator]] in the market so that's very important there's a lot of things like that that are very important but i think the main thing i would give is that the moment we understood how to create tools via abstraction we were no longer evolutionarily precedented and so we [2518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2518.0s)

can't apply evolutionary theory to us in the same way and all you've got to do is just like look at a gorilla attacking and then watch a nuclear bomb go off and look at a beaver cutting trees down and then watch and burn and look at a great white eating tuna and then look at a mile-long driftnet pulling up you know hundreds of tons of fish and you're like oh we're [2542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2542.31s)

not [[apex predator|apex predators]] right look at abby dam as beaver dam is the most radical environmental engineering of any animal then look at la as you're flying into it and so okay we are not evolutionarily precedented creatures and religions talked about us being between the animals and the gods and needing to ascend into our godlike nature and really what we can see with [2565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2565.62s)

exponentially increasing technology is the power of gods right i'm speaking metaphorically but but something that is less like the power of animals and more like the power of what we would ascribe to who can create and maintain and destroy the whole and so if you have the power of gods and you don't have the right choice making to hold that power ie the love and wisdom and prudence of [2586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2586.95s)

gods then that's a temporary story what should serve the role that we that mainstream thinks evolution serves what's a different theory or school or as it is it created it should be great like if we are gone beyond evolution how do we so evolution is a process by which new things come to be that were not before tool-making or technology design as a process by which new things come to [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2618.27s)

be that weren't before the unconscious relationship between those two self terminates at a certain point we can think about in a very general sense and we could go deeper into this but in a general sense we can think about evolution as an unconscious process there's not like a central top-down mediated to here we want creatures like this there's mutation is an unconscious [2639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2639.72s)

process and then survival selection everybody wants to survive inmate selection right so but what happens is the the fact that mutation is distributed across the whole system and the selective pressures are co selective creates a radically decentralized radically parallel type of process that ends up being very slow most things fail but what makes it through are highly [2664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2664.17s)

interoperable increasing in order to complex it equal and tool-making so we can think of we can think of evolution as a kind of decentralized unconscious parallel process but that is actually tending to the meta stability of the whole tool-making as a conscious process can happen in a single individual can happen in or small groups can happen in serial [2688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2688.89s)

not parallel someone can take insights and you know recursively work on those insights and it creates parts ready to create up regulates one input variable relative to others to be able to up regulate some output variables relative to others through the conscious ability to understand that so there is a new third creative process so if we say that evolution is unconscious tending of [2716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2716.64s)

holes that obviously i'm simplifying radically to make a construction here and tool-making is conscious creation of parts then there has to be a new process that is the conscious creation and tending of holes and because if all of the agents are acting like parts and up regulating their capacity but breaking the power symmetry that is where the meta stability comes and not thinking of [2739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2739.77s)

the long-term of the whole and it when anyone deploys more asymmetrical power power everyone then ends up reverse engineering it also deploying it you get this [[exponential curve]] of power deployment all of which is driving entropy and driving externalization that ends so as soon as we can affect the whole that significantly there has to be conscious governance of how that occurs [2760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2760.5s)

which is where there has to be large-scale sense-making and large scale values generation meaning thoughts about what is good beyond just what wins and rivals contexts and then large scale coordination capacity and so and this is where we start to talk about well how do we develop humans that can do that how do we develop relationships and communication processes and protocols [2782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2782.55s)

that work better at shared sense-making and shared values generation to inform better shared choice making where we actually have better capacity to coordinate than getting stuck in things like [[perverse incentive]] and [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] yeah this making a couple things one is as it makes sense to think of humans as a means to an end in terms of some other being that has you know more powers than just like we you know we were some other being before us was it was means to to us and does this resonate or the idea of like global brain or the noosphere or like and how do you see that manifesting or or playing out do i think that we are part of the hydra hydrocarbon bootloader process to make the advanced silica-based a eyes that then deplete [2828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2828.43s)

replace all the hydrocarbons and are better or that humans give rise to the trans humans and some sense in terms of how we technologically modify ourselves our physiological substrate both of those sound pretty dystopic to me and i would very much like to make sure we are not heading down those trajectories i think that we it's kind of like you see a plant that has some traditional [2856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2856.569s)

recognized medicinal value and then we try to use scientific method to identify the active ingredient extract that active ingredient potent eyes it and then give it as a drug and we're paying attention to one thing that that herb supposedly did and we're measuring that one thing that one metric and we say look at this is a more powerful but there there's often also a process where [2879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2879.279s)

now that more powerful thing might also cause side effects that the plan didn't have there's externalities because there was a synergy of the way the molecules work together but it might also be that there were a bunch of other things that were not the primary objective that were positive things that were happening that are now lost so oftentimes something makes it through whether its genetic or [2901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2901.69s)

mimetic makes it through an [[evolutionary process]] that factors everything in a closed-loop way and then we try to understand it by reducing it to some number of active metrics that we can then measure and optimize and the unknown unknown set the set of things that are relevant that we don't even know that we don't know that aren't in our model is more important than we [2923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2923.019s)

account for most of the time and so yeah i think that there is a fundamental information theoretic problem and the way we think about ai the way we think about crisper and synthetic biology which is we will define what we're trying to achieve as good with one or two or five known metrics and we will seek to make a technology that has the first-order [2950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2950.17s)

effect of increasing those metrics right the first-order effect meaning a direct effect and the calculation to be able to see a first-order effect on a known small set of metrics is relatively easy but the ability to calculate for second and third and fourth order effects on a very large unknown set of metrics is very hard there is a you know a p naught equals np issue here and so but if i'm [2975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=2975.97s)

being driven by kind of first to market or first to publish kind of dynamics i have not i have the opposite of an incentive to do deep and protracted safety analysis i have all of the incentive to say well we learn from mistakes and you know let's go but the level of mistakes when we're making things that replicate like it's a really big deal to get that pattern replication [3001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3001.14s)

tack it's different it's different even than moocs cuz nukes don't make more nukes and detonate themselves but biotech dollars and you know and possibly autopoietic a i could write so the moment we start getting into technology that is self-replicating or just too powerful when we don't have safe to fail probes and we don't even recognize how shitty we are at safety [3022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3022.23s)

analysis on second third fourth order effects over longer periods of time on metrics we don't know to look at this is a this is an information theory issue that we really have to pay more attention to with the level of technology capacity we're getting so i'm saying this to say that i think a lot of the oh we understand the genome well enough to start editing it is is stupid [3042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3042.599s)

hubris and that doesn't mean that i'm a luddite that says there is no way to move forward it means what is what is the actual complexity of the situation information theoretically and then what's the complexity of my analysis in terms of orders of magnitude and are they close and if my analysis is factored tend to the five bits and the reality of the situation is maybe ten to [3064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3064.65s)

the twenty bits of information i probably shouldn't do the thing yet and i should think about safe to fail now this is an information theoretic thing but i think mostly it's actually not in information to everything it's a motive thing because i'm not even motivated to try to do good safety analysis and motivated to do the bare minimum safety analysis as a source [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3083.73s)

of [[plausible deniability]] to say that i did safety analysis to actually move forward as fast as i can on getting whatever that one or two metrics that gives me [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage that i'm trying to optimize for i want to go back to a choice making and then to transitionary systems a couple questions one is you mentioned in a different episode about how sort of that [3106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3106.17s)

we have these false paradoxes between sort of or false you know false dichotomies between mind body or heart brain or are there others i'm curious we unpack that a little bit wouldn't be where it comes from or why it's false and then mention if we think about science is one tool in the toolkit is there what's another important tool how do you think about that that's woke up [3127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3127.47s)

broadly in terms of you good choice making and then maybe this is related to and i know this is a huge topic so it's a little bit of an injustice to just shrink it to a minute but if you could sort of write the crux of what you find really interesting about forest landers work or what you think is contribution is i accept that's related yeah in terms of the need to have a ethical system [3153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3153.03s)

that is commensurable that is able to have logical congruence with the philosophy of science so that the philosophy that gives rise to our ability to make more powerful choices is also connected to the ability to make better choices working towards that in a meaningful way is one of the areas that forests work has been that i think is most meaningful of a contribution [3188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3188.82s)

there's lots of things i think a very meaningful contribution and so you know again we said the philosophy of science looks at the domain of the measurable and repeatable or we can say the domain of measurable repeatable specifically which is always going to be third and so there are some philosophical assumptions about what third-person means what first-person means and what [3212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3212.68s)

the relationship between first and third person are or reifying what we mean by subjective what we mean by objective and what the relationship between subjective and objective are that forests work starts at that level and the reification gives the basis to then be able to ground the philosophy of science and something deeper than it like well obviously if we're looking at the domain [3237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3237.039s)

of measurable and repeatable we we have to start with measurable and the measurement always involves a measure or measuring some measured there's a triplicate relationship between the observed the process of observation and the observer and yet then what we try to do is take for the most part the measurement process and especially the measure for granted and create an [3258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3258.759s)

ontology of measures even though the fundamental basis of the concept of measurement itself isn't even semantically frame abaut in a logical way without those three concepts being bound so it's very interesting if you look at kind of vedanta kai deal ism or buddhist idealism or solipsism in general on one side and you look at physicalism on the other side i would [3284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3284.949s)

say that they make the exact same reductive mistake so physicalism says that objective or physical is fundamentally real and subjective is either not real like it's just an illusion all uh you know radical limit of ism or it's an epiphenomena it's a you know secondary and they have a very compelling argument for that right the compelling argument is it requires [3316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3316.179s)

assuming a bunch of things as more epistemic ly grounded than i think they are but so bigbang just a bunch of plasma and then particles and whatever it doesn't seem like there's anything we can call consciousness and they're eventually planets at a certain point hydrological biological process protocells whatever it's very hard to think about consciousness before that so [3342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3342.22s)

it seems like there was physical stuff before there was consciousness stuff so then consciousness must have emerged out of there and if people can describe their [[subjective experience]] while hooked up to an eeg or an fmri and we can look at their brain and we can see some type of statistical correlation between patterns of brain and their [[subjective experience]] and we can say there's a correlation between subjective and objective but we think that the objective is controlled by the objective ie that physics is causally closed therefore your brain state this moment as the result of your brain state a moment ago and the particle physics that governs you know ion differentials of what's going to actually happen in the brain in relationship with the body in [3383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3383.53s)

the environment so if there is a one-for-one correlation between described subjective states and observed objective states and the objective states are the result of scientific causation and this closure over that then subjectivity must be a a causal epiphenomena right like there's various versions of that argument and as you can see you know argument between sam harris [3407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3407.77s)

and m dan dennett who both would typically think of themselves as being mostly informed by the philosophy of science come to you know dan dennett says that consciousness is not real but free will is and sam says free will is not real but consciousness is and at the end of their argument sam said something like it appears we have fundamentally different intuitions on this which is [3433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3433.03s)

actually very important which meant that the symbol grounding was actually the the key thing and this is where you get tarce keys theorem you know coming out of girdle's theorem which is that any formal logical system involves ideas that cannot be reified in that system and that means that there is no logical system that is consistent that's also complete and i now this comes back to i [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3454.0s)

said there is no perfect [[social system]] and it comes back to why the first thing lao tzu said when he wrote this book is that the dao that is nameable as eternal dao is the formal system that is complete doesn't exist right okay so we can see how basically philosophy of science is and obviously i'm radically oversimplifying to go quickly and we can [3481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3481.1s)

do the nuance thing at some point so the question what is real philosophy of science says well the stuff that is measurable and repeatable seems to be pretty clearly real because we might think that sound is faster than light but we can all measure that it's not and it's the same every time and so the the congruence of objectivity and the repeatability of it and its independence [3502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3502.4s)

to our beliefs about it seems like a good basis for real and then the fact that we can make predictions with it and make out of it and that works and whatever and so then of course you have an epistemology which is measuring and repeating and then testing and you know like that which is given epistemology of third person that is the epistemology that makes sense starting with the [3525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3525.29s)

oncologic assumption that what is real is the stuff that you can assess me about epistemology and so then you do a bunch of third-person assessment and all you find is causation and third-person and so of course you end up then coming to what is real is third-person stuff because your whole process has been measurements on third-person stuff so there's an ontological assumption that [3545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3545.0s)

creates an inappropriate epistemology that then proves the ontological assumption so then they don tor buddhism did the exact same thing on the opposite side they say that subjectivity is fundamental and objectivity is either an illusion or maya you know etc or in epiphenomena the structures arising within consciousness and they argue it in a very similar kind of way on the [3567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3567.35s)

opposite they say well i don't really i can't prove that i'm not dreaming or in a hallucination or anything else so my measurements might all be part of a dream and you and the repeatability of it is all part of my dream so i have less epistemic ground on the objective stuff out here than i have on the basis that there is an experience arising that i'm actually experiencing something [3588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3588.32s)

they've hart said something obviously very similar to this and so what i have the most epistemic grounding on is that experience is occurring but my perception of myself as experience or might be an illusion is a self here but it might be different than i think it is and there's a world but it might be different than i think it is so there is some self experiencing [3607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3607.97s)

a world experience or experiencing and experienced that they the experienced and the experienced or might have delusion but the experience is prima facie occurring so what i can what is real is that which can be experienced as opposed to measured and repeated therefore i have an epistemology of inquiry and noticing the nature of experience and running experiments in [3633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3633.68s)

there of moving attention in certain ways and seeing what happens with experience and so i get a phenomenological epistemology and then that ends up confirming see everything that i noticed is experience and everything that is objective is a riot i can only say even exists because i'm experiencing it if i couldn't actually experience the measurement the [3653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3653.06s)

measurement wouldn't have occurred this is the if the tree falls in the forest and there's no one there to hear so i would say that they both basically made an oncological that then created an epistemology that then confirmed the oncologic assumption in east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet and then of course silicon valley and [3671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3671.18s)

whatever we do this very funny thing like take principles of buddhism to do a mindfulness practice to crush the competition more effectively which is a very funny strange hybrid of kind of the [[game theory|game theoretic]] versions of both but underneath the experience so ok the vedantist will walk you through a process and say notice the tree now notice that you want the tree you're the [3700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3700.4s)

one noticing the tree ok so notice some other objects notice that you aren't those objects you're the one noticing the objects now notice your thoughts those thoughts are objects objects of attention so notice that you you can hold an image of the tree in your mind so you aren't the thoughts you are the witness of the thoughts and you aren't the emotions the sensations because [3718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3718.67s)

you're witnessing them on and on and so all of those are not ultimately what you are they're changing what is unchanging and all of them is the witness therefore you know the upanishads say again and again only the self is real only the witness is real right but they start with an observer observing and observed right i had to start with the tree i had to start with a bunch of objects to even [3743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3743.15s)

point at the subject because the subject is not even defined a ball outside of its relationship with an object whether the object is a perception or the perceived right answer i took for granted that i was only able to even notice subjectivity or consciousness or reference it by starting with subjective objective in the relationship between them which is the same thing as i start [3765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3765.02s)

with in science taking a measurement and there is clearly a conscious experience of registering a measurement through a measurement process then i'm going to take for granted the conscious registering of that and the measurement process to make an ontology of the measured so there is a deeper process that says that to even define observation or experience or [3788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3788.75s)

measurement well there it are these binding of the concepts that are necessary and sufficient and there's a triplicate kind of binding if we can define a formal philosophy there a formal metaphysics there then the unti epistemology of the objective which will be a reified philosophy of science is now founded in something that also can give us a epistemology of the subjective [3814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3814.04s)

and an epistemology of the relationship between the subjective and the objective and ethics actually lives in the relationship between the subjective and the objective which is why you have to factor objective measurement metrics utilitarianism and why that is necessary but not sufficient so forests work you know if somebody google's eminent metaphysics you'll see a pdf come up and [3838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3838.13s)

then he has a few other writings on a website you vsm calm forests work so we know from from girdle's theorem we know from car skis theorem that we cannot have a system that is both perfectly complete and perfectly congruent so one of the things that forest ends up doing in the metaphysics is actually defining an upper bound on the knowable and in any domain where the upper bound on the [3866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3866.359s)

noble is that's something called the increments raishin theorem and then being able to define what the appropriate epistemic process within the domain of the knowable is and then also how to do inner domain transfers across the epistemic so different systems and so basically as a metaphysics it is not complete but it defines the upper bound of what level of completeness could [3889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3889.22s)

happen and then it it offers the upper bound of completeness that's at least the claim and it was interesting for me when i first looked at it and i had you know decent background in both science and the philosophy of science and philosophic systems including you know person whitehead and other people that had done things that were maybe closest in that direction it really just looked [3911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3911.06s)

like gibberish when you read the axioms and modalities it is hard for it to make any sense and it also seemed kind of like impenetrable gibberish so if i only got the book i would have definitely not done much with it after the first half an hour and then gave up it was only because i got to spend a decent bit of time with forrest and he was able to actually show me the application of it [3934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3934.73s)

to solving problems that in domains that i knew well that i'm like oh that is actually a novel insight in the entire space that i actually know well and that that happened across enough spaces that i gave the benefit of the doubt to say oh there's actually an epistemic there that i can see the expressions of in areas that i have more domain knowledge so then the long haul [3958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3958.07s)

of working to understand it came in and i will say that it's been extremely helpful in being able to take other epistemologies like evolutionary theory or [[complexity science]] or mathematics or whatever and understand them in terms of a meta epistemology that both gives more clarity and insight and more capacity for inter domain transfers formal inter-domain transfers jordan hall and i [3983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=3983.06s)

were having this conversation the other day because so much of the time that is a epistemic system that we use when discussing other things we're like how do we it's so hard to have conversations where people don't have this now because it is such a powerful set of tools so we're working on helping forests develop ways of having people be able to learn the rel [4003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4003.85s)

and parts easier because right now it's not very easy totally sam harrison jordan pearson had this sort of famous debate i don't know exactly what the contents were my understanding is that john pierce was pro religion and sam harris was sort of anti religion and then brett weinstein stein also has a sort of own view on [[game theory]] and the importance of and you sometime you talking about rising above [[game theory]] but he is a strong no no we need to harness [[game theory]] theory and use it in the right way to understand trade-offs and you talk about you know not needing or trying to rise above trade-offs i'm curious does anything there that's interesting that's worth commenting on so when i say things like having the power of gods requires [4043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4043.07s)

love and wisdom of gods i think a lot of people especially in the you know jordan peterson kind of world think that i'm gonna try and do jesus muddling and and i'm not i'm i'm using that phrase in ace in a symbolic way not a literal way and because it i think metaphorically or symbolically has insight that offers so i'm gonna say a [4070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4070.06s)

few more things that are taking a religious idea and i'm not going to do jesus smuggling i'm simply saying that there was actually philosophic insight expressed through the religious tradition that has value so the no false idols concept in the commandments the way that i think of that there's a few different ways but the way i think of that is that a model of reality is not [4093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4093.95s)

reality and this is back to i so moths ever writing of wrong right and this is back to that no consistent system will be complete and when you even look at the definition of a [[complex system]] in [[complexity science]] is a system that when you model it meaning model it means a finite set of variables and a finite set of transforms or algorithms right which will predict some percentage less than [4117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4117.98s)

100% of its behavior so when you create a complicated model of a [[complex system]] it still has some behavior not explained by the complicated system that we would describe as a [[emergent property|emergent properties]] and if you add more variables you might get closer - you go from 80% accuracy to 85% accuracy or whatever but you don't get 100% accuracy so of course the i you [4142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4142.5s)

know the the like nixie an idea is that 0.99 nine nine nine indefinitely you run the limit of it equals one i think there's a fundamental philosophical amir this is numerically very useful that it is numerically valuable to consider it as one versus is one is actually a really important distinction so similarly there's a we see some correlation we assume some causation we [4167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4167.88s)

see that as we add more variables it gets closer therefore we assume it is purely deterministic on a finite variable said that we have not understood all the variables of completely but we're converging on perfect understanding no we're converging on statistically better understanding that will always continue to have unknown unknown and gaps in it [4186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4186.21s)

and so given that biology and ecology and psychology and sociology and all the things that we really care about are because i would say we only care about tools and infrastructure insofar as they affect those things the things that we really care about are all [[complex system|complex systems]] which the model of the [[complex system]] will never be the thing right it doesn't mean it's not useful it can be [4211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4211.679s)

totally useful but also if i make a model of a thing that doesn't describe its behavior perfectly there's some [[emergent property|emergent properties]] not described by the model then if i owe my 's for the model where the model doesn't map to the realities where i up the reality and we see that all the time with very simplified economic models of rational human actors and you know malthusian [4231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4231.21s)

insights and whatever and reality doesn't follow the model perfectly so it has some benefit and then some up things right so then we try to make a slightly more complicated model so the no false idols is that the model of reality is never reality so don't ever get too attached to it don't ever get emotionally religiously attached to capitalism or to communism or to a [4255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4255.09s)

particular scientific understanding of a thing hold it as useful and maybe the best we currently have and as fundamentally and inexorably inadequate so there is a reverence for reality that is beyond current and ever description and that reverence for reality has a seek to want to keep making better models while not being attached to our models just saying they [4277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4277.35s)

are relatively better than other models and inadequate and we're pretty sure a thousand years from now we'll have much much better models and then a thousand years from then again right so religion i've been reading the founding fathers of this country letters to each other a lot lately as i've been thinking about [[public education]] and the need for just an almost mind-blowing an increase in [4303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4303.12s)

what we would call [[public education]] and one of the things they spoke to again again we can think this is an antiquated idea of a bunch of like old white dudes in a time where science had in advance enough and i really think that that is a mistaken assessment they talked about the need for a religious education as being as critical as a education in the sciences and technology and trades and [4331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4331.5s)

etc and some of them said things like i actually don't care if they're studying confucius or rumi or you know whatever it's that there needs to be a transcendental operator there needs to be that whatever our current model is we need to be able to have at least some frames for an intuitive connection to something that is beyond the limit of those frames and so this is where i [4354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4354.3s)

would say that you know utilitarian ethics is necessary but not sufficient virtue ethics also serves a role because in utilitarian ethics first if i take negative utilitarianism i want to minimize suffering then obviously the best way to do that is to just kill the universe and i'll have the least area under the curve of suffering into the future we can see that every one of the [4374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4374.219s)

utilitarian series if hypotheses if i do a reductio ad absurdum i can see that it doesn't actually further and this is again one of these partial considerations of something more complex than the model can hold and so in utilitarian calculus i have to assume higher degree of epistemic certainty than i usually have when actually making choice right because often time [4402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4402.09s)

i'm making a choice in not only the complex domain but the anthro complex domain the domain of humans interacting with lots of humans interacting with biological systems interacting with technological systems and so what i'll end up doing is say ok the things that matter are these things and the effect of this action is going to be this and so i'm willing to have the ends justify [4423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4423.059s)

the means and i'll sacrifice some harm here for some greater good here but so often i cannot actually say that that will be the greater good that in terms of the effect of the action that the harm will be limited in that way that the benefits will be that because the unknown unknown set is so large now i'm not doing a god of the gaps argument i'm saying simply we can't predict the [4443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4443.67s)

weather 10 days out and so one of the place where people start to look at virtue ethics is ok be where i don't have the epistemic certainty to just run a utilitarian calculus on a finite set of metrics is there something that creates more integrity in the moment where then the next moment unfolds from greater integrity and we can say that the way that people think about both [4468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4468.059s)

utilitarian and virtue ethics are like they're not even using deep enough cognitive tools and you know so we can that this is where i do think that the metaphysics is you know a deepening of the cognitive tools that are being used it's very interesting so i think you know religions were obviously like there were philosophers who were wise people who were having deep experiences and [4491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4491.459s)

noticing humanity and paying attention to earlier philosophers that had genetically identical brains to what we have today and who were sharing wise things and then there was the capture of that by political forces that distorted it for up purposes and it's both and there's heaps of up dhamma relevant stuff and there's actually keeps of really deep insightful things [4513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4513.239s)

and i would neither want to have to keep the bathwater nor throw the baby out nor be bound to the previous babies as the best baby we can get right so i think that when the founding fathers are saying there's a need for something like a religious process is when people think about heaven and hell and some almighty god judging or they think about reincarnation [4536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4536.61s)

or something like that if they're not yet at the kind of level of moral development that can transcend narcissism and care about the [[subjective experience]] of others for no rationalize benefit to themselves then thinking about reward and punishment for themselves in an afterlife is a nice way to smuggle in infinity right it's a nice way to at least get them to for their [4559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4559.76s)

own self benefit think about things that in the rational calculus right now they can't see how serves their own self benefit but there's something in a transcendental operator of what is more meaningful to me than my own life and do i have a sense of life with a capital l like all of life all of experience that is more than just my experience and we're beyond choice making calculus i [4582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4582.369s)

have a yeah i have some unfuck with the bull virtues and ethical senses of course the religions are not adequate and of course they have heaps of nonsense but i think the need for a transcendental operator is clear there than the question of what do trends and mental operators that are not irrational gibberish that is also bound to bad concepts what does that look like moving [4611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4611.21s)

forward and i think we could look at this in a way that would both clarify and reify previous religions into healthier versions of themselves as well as offer a post religion post science philosophy that includes and transcends the meaningful parts of both pre-modern and modern bert weinstein had a quote he said something along the lines of you know i i think of religions is not [4635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4635.869s)

literally true but metaphorically true in the sense of if i believe them my life will be better basically that they do not literally happen but there are some truths that i is indescribable is that a we with that crude that crude but very simplified statement do you do you resonate with her as you see it's like differently there's not not the right way to think about i think we have [4656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4656.84s)

to be very careful here because you know we can make the bertrand russell argument very quickly against them that believing nonsense because it seems to make you happier or have some pragmatic or utilitarian purpose is not a reasonable thing to do because if it's not true it'll end up actually reality up in some ways as you're operating on a not true map of [4683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4683.149s)

the real territory but affecting the territory in the process so i don't think it's that we want to indulge things that are untrue because it seems comforting i think it's that we recognize that the philosophy of science and utilitarianism do not give us access to all of the true and so then we have to say what is an expanded epistemology for the domain of the real not just the [4712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4712.879s)

domain of the repeatable and the objective so in the same way that and you know then people very quickly say well intuition is just pretty obviously corrupted by desires and fears and love oh rationality is obviously corrupted yet you have to train rationality this is actually what formal logic and mathematics and critical thinking and you know all of the domains of learning [4736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4736.399s)

how to think properly are because we've all heard people make rational arguments that are just utterly gibberish because of lots of rational mistakes logical fallacies whatever you have to train intuition as well and if you look at what narcissists and sociopaths will do in gaslighting that will end up other people up gaslighting is usually making a rational [4758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4758.079s)

argument that someone feels compelled to believe that gets them to override their intuition and so someone's like man something feels wrong with this person feels like they're not being honest with me or whatever and then the person makes the argument well enough and they're like okay well i want to give the benefit of the doubt i don't want whatever it is and so and then they [4774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4774.709s)

realize that they were actually being played by someone that was better at playing the game than they were there is a way that we can use a rationalist orientation to gaslight ourselves to override other valid methods of knowing because we don't know how to do the derivation and we want to be able to do the derivation we want an electoral congruence now the argument i'm making [4797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4797.629s)

can then easily be weaponized to smuggle in gibberish but then recognizing that someone can smuggle in gibberish can also have them reject the truth to the argument and so there is no way forward other than a truly earnest one because you can weaponize the arguments on either sides i want to return back to or delve into transitionary systems and some my sort [4823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4823.89s)

of these are all related but so many questions there are how do we internalize externalities what does it look like to eliminate trade-offs how do we you know what technology can help us build you know real-time balance sheet of the commons are there examples of game be sort of institutional you know examples that exist today or even directions but you're directionally [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4844.94s)

gimpy ok i was talking about weaponization a moment ago and also virtue signaling earlier there's a lot of stuff that calls itself conscious capitalism or impact investment or sustainable business or whatever that you know is basically advertising something can be like that is never going to violate a [[fiduciary responsibility]] to do profit maximization or actually have any real consequential 'ti on its own advantage and it's just basically taking a part of its marketing or talent retention budget to you know appeal to millennials or to regulatory bodies or whatever it is so are there are there things that companies can do are the things within market dynamics that would be good for the world totally but are there a lot of things [4898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4898.08s)

that are advertising that they are that that aren't actually that also totally so the discernment of anyone who's thinking about getting involved either as an investor or an employee or whatever like there has to be fairly close thoughtful discernment i was just talking to a guy the other day who had been at one of the top position at one of the major banks and is now in one of [4921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4921.99s)

the south american countries that has part of the amazon and is working on a approach to protect the amazon and use market-based solutions to make the amazon worth more alive than dead so that's you know market dynamics will keep it alive and well that would be a nice thing to do the particular strategy was like terrible everywhere because you [4943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4943.09s)

know involved things like well the indigenous people who depend upon the environment there and protected if we can support their rights in some way that will end up supporting me amazon therefore we're making this fairtrade artisan crafts business thing that the indigenous people will produce their stuff and we'll sell the out of it and be able to provide you know [4963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4963.91s)

economic well benefit to those acres associate and like okay so right now the indigenous people do like a thousand things and making just the amount of crafts that they need to live is one of the things that they do now as soon as you start providing economic advantage and survival to doing that one thing and not all the other things and you just convert the [4987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=4987.1s)

indigenous people to a chinese sweatshop where now everyone just does the artisan crafts all of the time and they try and bring in more people to do that thing and like if you want to know how to destroy an indigenous culture figure out how to monetize one part of it heavily independent of any kind of value on the other things and this is where we talked about values that are extractable and [5005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5005.04s)

exchangeable compared to things that are valuable but aren't extractable and exchangeable so it's very important to really think through those strategies and say is this going to be an the right way to do it and when you start to monetize one of the parts that is extractable and exchangeable and not all the other ones and you confer a lot of advantage in doing that then obviously [5025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5025.8s)

you start to bias the entire culture towards doing that particular thing and you lose key other parts so it's not just as someone has to say will this be net positive and in a false dichotomy that says well if we don't do that they're all burned and slaughtered but you have to say are there better strategies so this action important topic the rationalist community has this [5045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5045.69s)

you know ongoing debate in certain areas on [[mistake theory]] versus [[conflict theory]] michael vassar turned me on to this thinking and there's this question of do we do the dumb things because of a [[mistake theory]] meaning there was just no way we could have predicted that externality which is too hard oh or [[conflict theory]] which was we didn't really try to predict the externality or [5072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5072.0s)

the problem or we even wanted to cause it and while both are true one of the things we have to factor is that [[mistake theory]] ends up being a source of [[plausible deniability]] for [[conflict theory]] so there are heaps of places where we are actually doing something that we know is going to cause harm and whether it's png not fixing their things or the deep shore thing you know not [5097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5097.11s)

fixing its oil rigging or the whatever like we know something's gonna cause a problem or we don't know it is but we didn't really try to do good safety analysis either because that would have been expensive and then after the fact we say there's no way we could have known so we'll end up using complexity and [[mistake theory]] as a source of [[plausible deniability]] for being and so we have to be very careful not to do that so oftentimes we'll look at a strategy and make a very false comparison and say well either we do this or don't do this and if we don't do it great tragedy so we strawman all the other possibilities to then support why ours is utilitarian the best as opposed to really try to think are there better [5139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5139.38s)

strategies and probably there are much better strategies but maybe they take more thinking and don't provide as much immediate capitalisation for me so again there is no answer other than really deep earnestness of what you actually care about okay so the reason i brought that up is to say are there things that are advertised as transitional or [[game b]] or vectoring in the right direction that [5162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5162.18s)

really should not be considered that yes so one has to really do the thoughtful [[sensemaking]] if they actually care about the direction things are really oriented you know attention economy what could be done there i haven't done a thorough enough analysis to be able to make false suggestions and say that when we run the run all of the try and as best we can second third order effects that this [5189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5189.96s)

would be the right thing to do but we can at least propose in the direction of i think jaron lane ears argument around that one of the problems of the facebook youtube kind of it attention capture world one of the sources of the kind of tristan harris problems is that the internet was developing in a way where we both wanted information to be free and we wanted [5212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5212.01s)

entrepreneurs to be able to make a lot of money and so the answer was the advertising model and the advertising model up the fiduciary relationship orientation where facebook the user is not the customer the advertiser is the customer so their actual orientation is to optimize the utility for their customer and that's their [[fiduciary responsibility]] but the person that is using it that is sharing all of their personal information and their life and their the the degree of personal information they share with everybody over messenger and whatever is then all being weaponized against them for you know the advertisement whereas if there was a pay for service model it would be closer to a market like in terms of adam smith theory make a [5252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5252.69s)

product or service and deliver it to a customer at a value that they want to pay for and deliver better product to them as soon as your intermediating it through deliver it to somebody else's customer where it's it's not clear you know how the market dynamics work i think you've actually broken what should be the intelligence of a market and you've made something that's [5276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5276.42s)

fundamentally has to be evil and so if people had to pay a monthly fee to access youtube or to access facebook and there was no incentive for them to maximize time on site there was only an incentive for them to actually have the customers feel more fulfilled with their experience so rather than drive addiction through [[hypernormal stimuli]] they were trying to drive the actual [5300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5300.0s)

quality of engagement i think that would make a huge difference now exactly how do we do that how do we transition the existing ones how to make the new ones i don't know a lot of like we would have to do the kind of design work and to do the design work we'd have to identify the [[problem space]] well enough to do the design work but just an example of kind of thinking through changes that could [5321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5321.45s)

be made that still allow businesses to operate but that don't allow all of the business models because some of the business models are really enough they should just be regulated against if you had asked me in a message earlier what do i think the role of bc's could be i want to see financial institutions that are created that invest only in technologies that [5344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5344.249s)

are needed to solve the fundamental problems of the world including the rd that's needed in the domain of atoms and energy not just bits long term and large scale i think that money on money dynamics so i've got money i'm gonna loan it to you i want to 10x my money because a bunch of them are gonna fail or a hundred extra thousand x so i want the fastest path to liquidity events i [5369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5369.09s)

think that is one of the things that has most the entire intelligence of the market i think that when you look at a you know kind of classical market financial services were and should be less than 5% of the total market and now they're you know 35 40 percent i think that is completely predated and extractive and not creative and so you know you look at 1971 nixon getting us [5395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5395.699s)

off the gold standard and off of the [[bretton woods]] convention and the beginning of all the financial deregulation that occurred and you see that the government and the market stopped innovating in the way that they had before we stopped having like apollo projects and then hatton projects we started having stupidly bloated f-35s it cost 1.5 trillion dollars that we [5415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5415.679s)

didn't need in the first place and so i think that like china right now because and you can see why china has an emperor that doesn't have term limits and that basically got rid of the [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and created a you know kind of top-down control system so they can actually coordinate well there's all the  up things of dictatorship that there's also if you a democracy or [5439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5439.709s)

republic is only better than a dictatorship if you have a really educated population that can overcome the cemetry the asymmetry of supply-side orientation which we don't have in which case this thing ends up having so many [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] and broken sense-making that really you have the simulation of a democracy that is in all of our key [5461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5461.55s)

controlling representatives on both sides so you can't even have accountability to the the dictators and the short term term limits were no we'll invest in long-term stuff so china's getting to build high-speed rail all over the country right and not just their country all over africa and all over you know other parts of southeast asian into europe and getting [5480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5480.18s)

to do like fundamental r&d and infrastructure development we haven't done good new infrastructure in forever and or the kind of r&d so like where the  is the thorium research right like the the government should have a it's also important understand when you look at post-world war two a lot of the things that we attribute to market were actually because of government spending [5503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5503.94s)

and the market wouldn't have done it otherwise a lot of like the early contracts to hp and ibm were government contracts that put the money and to be able to do deep r&d that created stuff that than the private sector benefited for so government's actually investing a percentage of federal budget in r&d and then in infrastructure is important and so neither is the public sector as the [5524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5524.16s)

government doing that nor does the private sector have twenty five year return horizons to be able to do stuff like thorium and trains and whatever so short-term money on money basically broke everything right in the financial sector short-term money on money both the directors and officers of a corporation being held on quarterly timeline so of course they're not going [5544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5544.89s)

to like do something that will give payoff at the long time in the future and the representatives having four year time term lines like notre dom took 200 years to build thorium is going to take a while to research trains take a while to build so i would like to see venture funds and growth equity funds that say we do not need another snap chat right we do not need more kind of like [5568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5568.89s)

addictive technology even though metcalfe's law is awesome and will like make a lot of money doing it like not only do we not need it it's net bad for the world so we're not going to fund that we are only going to fund the things that the world really needs that are not currently on track to happen that solve major problems and we're gonna do stuff not just in the domain of [5585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5585.18s)

bits because of course bits i have no cost of goods in the domain a bit so i can have exponential returns that i don't because of all margin that i don't have in the domain of atoms we're actually have cost of goods but the virtual is based upon the value of the physical and so if the virtual starts debase the physical because it's easier for capital to flow [5604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5604.77s)

there now again any system that emerges out of a foundational system and then he bases its own substrate itself-terminating the virtual needs to enrich the physical not debase it so a healthy [[social media]] would be one that made people's friendships and physical life better but if i'm with my friends and i'm checking facebook or i'm so socially awkward because i grew up on it [5626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5626.1s)

that i don't have real friends then the virtual is debasing the physical that is net bad for the world if financially the virtual debases investment in the physical that isn't that bad for the world so i want to see people who are investing in long-term r&d of real stuff that needs to happen specifically in the domain of atoms and energy and who have a longer term you know event horizon [5649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5649.47s)

associated with that and it it still market right it i'm still nothing about nonprofit i'm still talking about being able to make returns and so start to think about dynasties again in your family name and being able to you know optimize for that because otherwise the time horizons are too short so i do think that wanting to figure like waiting to see because building is [5672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5672.57s)

hard and so vcs have this position of let other people build see the stuff that looks like it could succeed and then try to capture as much ownership of it as possible the board seats etc to be able to create a artificial distorted bubble on its valuation to exit that's just evil right like it's bad for everybody other than them in terms of bad for the [5694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5694.65s)

world i would like to see people who have capital saying how do we deploy this capital which is concentrated choice-making ability to actually make good choices right when we're talking about choice making power needs choice making basis money is concentrated choice making so what are we doing it in service to and for the most part anyone who has [[asymmetric power]] is incentive to and capable to use their [[asymmetric power]] to maintain and increase the asymmetry of their power that will always that's eboard that's the up thing we need to say how do i use my [[asymmetric power]] to actually increase the baseline of quality of life for everyone to actually use my [[asymmetric power]] to debase the asymmetry of it by rising everybody up not by you know [5738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5738.39s)

lowering notley tall poppy syndrome communism but but nobody's oriented to do that but there's it would be totally possible to be a mention of entry capitalist who said i am looking to use market dynamics and also use philanthropic dynamics where that makes sense or government type dynamics for that makes sense to actually do things that will be net positive to the world [5761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5761.01s)

not where i can tell the story that it wasn't that positive as a type of marketing and [[plausible deniability]] for something that was clearly just net positive for me so yes i would like to see financial services totally restructured and i would like to see anyone with integrity actually work on their own internal congruence to say there are deals i'm willing to turn down [5778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5778.38s)

there are places where i'm not going to try and push for a liquidity event or  take the company away from the founders if the founders actually care about something there are places where there's a good idea but the founders are evil and i don't want to support that thing like what what things am i willing to say no to and what things are worth saying yes to and then actually find and [5796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5796.68s)

invest in support in those things and with the time horizons that are needed to do the type of stuff that's needed yeah and a couple of things related to this one is you've written about our talked about how you want to see us move beyond [[private property]] or things like [[private property]] because so sort of projecting sort of implies that we are all sort of discrete individuals who you [5819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5819.42s)

know are not connected or don't you know have intersecting you know interweaving value creation or in ways i would align us better some theory you can unpack that i'm curious if you think wikipedia or crypto currencies are [[game b]] institutions and then maybe in closing as race that is how do we transition from you know from game a to game kb or some of these things you talked [5843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5843.0s)

about so when i've said that there are intrinsic [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] that are inseparable from [[private property]] well that is true that doesn't mean that i think we're anywhere close to being able to approach what it would take to change it in the same way that i was mentioning earlier that there's problems with having a single fungible currency single value metric that orient's towards [5865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5865.32s)

measurable extractable exchangeable wealth over other things and that orient's towards optionality of a real value and whatever so there's some very deep restructuring that is beyond the way we currently think of currency to mediate exchange and the ownership of the things in the first place [[private property]] this is not something that i see happening in this generation or the [5886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5886.17s)

next generation so we could have a conversation to talk about what those post capitalist systems look like but they don't lock away anything i've ever seen proposed so far that's the important thing to know so for the next few generations while those things are being developed it's actually making a [[liberal democracy]] better which largely looks like reversing the predatory decay that has happened and having markets more like markets and having representative democracy more like it was intended to be that is what we should be focused on so when i was talking about longer-term event horizons and more earnest assessment in financial services that's still game a in the way you know it is not a fundamentally axiomatically [5934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5934.8s)

restructured system but it's the healthiest expression and it's the version of game aid that is the story that we're sold right the story that we're sold is that markets drive innovation and the government's govern well and that representatives represent the people and that courts create justice and that universities teach people how to think well and that news [5954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5954.93s)

teaches you what's going on in the state of the world and the doctors make you healthy and the police keep you safe like that that's the gaming story it's just  not trip it doesn't mean it's not true anywhere of course it has elements of truth but we can also see how inside of those institutions people figured out how to degrade the [5971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5971.04s)

institutions in ways that were beneficial to themselves the thing for the whole so long as they could hide that right and this is you know when you look at baudrillard model of simula simulated decay which michael vassar also turned me on to it kind of explains how this phenomena happens so we need to reverse that kind of [[institutional decay]] and reboot something like better [5995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=5995.25s)

versions of these institutions to be directionally right while we are working on fundamentally new things from an axiom level and in a previous episode jordan i'm curious why you're using the game beam movement more broadly jordan hall said when it game he becomes a movement it will have failed i think it's being somewhat somewhat provocative there but [6014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6014.86s)

it was sort of how do you sort of think about these concepts that you've been talking about you all talked about from years start to gain a lot of momentum in community around them and what's your sort of advice for that community where you know failure modes to watch out for how do you think about sort of this burgeoning game be community and movement i think that most dominant [6035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6035.02s)

narratives politically right politically left whatever apolitical i think they're they were also influenced by the [[narrative warfare]] landscape of what do i need to do to get people to believe this to advance our agenda including where it's not fully true or where it's more provocative or where it's straw man's the other side or where it appeals to people's unmet needs and emotions in [6059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6059.349s)

ways we know aren't fully true or whatever i don't think that there are any dominant narratives on anything that are not mostly [[narrative warfare]] either side of [[climate change]] either side of capitalism vaccines whatever like i think most of the topics end up having people in institute's that have something to gain from lots of people believe in a certain thing figuring out [6082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6082.33s)

how to tell compelling versions of that they get people to defect on their own [[sensemaking]] to be part of an in-group arrayed against and held together against an out-group and so the kind of good new onst thinking that would be needed to figure out complex things i see almost nowhere and i think what jordan was referencing is [[game b]] which could very easily be another version of [6105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6105.01s)

that so who it used to be the pope and then it was you know university professor or whatever who's the authority that knows what's true and has the monopoly on legitimate authority who can tell everyone else is less smart and informed than them what true and right is to be able to control them basically the moment that legitimate authority seems to exist there's an orientation of [6125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6125.29s)

anyone who wants power to capture it and so then of course the sides that want whoever captures it once they continue to double down on it being legitimate authority and whoever wants to fight who capped it wants to be based at its fake news or it's a false narrative or whatever right i think that the idea of most people not doing in-depth [[sensemaking]] themselves and looking to see which of the talking heads they align with and which of the groups they can be part of the in-group on and defect on their own personal responsibility and [[sensemaking]] to be part of groupthink is the failure mode of game a and so it doesn't matter what narrative that's not the thing we want to do if there isn't a plant the flag you get everyone to rally as a war [6171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6171.82s)

around the new flag there's a how do we get people to actually make sense of the world better in a more thoughtful earnest nuanced way how do we get them to check their own biases better how do we get them to not be susceptible to groupthink better how do we get them to have more courage to express what they actually feel and believe in the presence of a group that is trying to [6189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6189.82s)

groupthink everyone into it and then how do we get higher qualities of civil conversation where the people are oriented to dialectic rather than war and defection i think what we're seeking is how do we have [[collective intelligence]] that is really [[collective intelligence]] rather than kind of dumb mobs captured by leaders that want to be leaders i want to be sensitive to time [6212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6212.2s)

so i want to close on on a last sort of couple questions that like previous ones are gonna seem very different maybe they're related feel free to take whichever ones appeal to you so one is that i just read this book the sovereign individual recently i have you read in sovereign individual the basic thesis is that we're going to transform through the 90s and we've says we're gonna [6234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6234.97s)

transform from citizens of governments you know we exist to serve government's to customers of governments where governments exist to serve us there any markets for governments the world is going to look you know technology up until now as increasingly central you know become more and more centralized it's now going to become more and more decentralized might look the world might [6251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6251.68s)

look like the decentralized city-states you know and people self segmenting i'm curious what you it you know i have you have a sort of if anything comes to mind for you when you think about that future another thing you've said in a different episode is you are more excited about sort of the enlightenment of the feminine and if i'm curious if you could talk a little [6271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6271.31s)

about that and then lastly and this is in closing you said you've been reading a lot about you know education or thinking a lot about what the future applications and maybe in closing any any any thoughts thoughts about that as relates to what we've been discussing it comes to mind i yeah i mean i'll just say as a general statement i think central versus decentralizing [6295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6295.46s)

other one of these kind of oversimplified [[narrative warfare]] things where of course there are things that are better when they're centralized and there are things that are better when they're decentralized and the best systems involve the relationship between those things and in a nuanced and contextual way because i can show failure modes of d central systems like [6316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6316.85s)

basically why china is doing better at infrastructure than the u.s. right now actually has to do it's more centralized control that doesn't create [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] but then you also see more corruption and control and you know less of certain kinds of innovation incentives with centralization so i think the conversation needs to go deeper than it usually does there [6338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6338.87s)

similarly if you apply gibberish market theory to government's and say we'll become customers and the company serves the customer but we know that the company can actually manufacture demand and capture the customer when it has asymmetric capacities like so basically i would say that in the same thing with masculine-feminine i think most of like we can see the left having a feminism [6362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6362.84s)

that is moved to kind of lgbtq trans ideology and in a racial ideology that is kind of represented in intersectionality and then we can see a very strong backlash to that and alt right kind of thinking and so there's like massively charged stuff here and i think the general the underlying ideas of what is true and what is good or we need to go much deeper on i think the [6394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6394.37s)

kahn i think the conversation is usually framed in a way where i'm rejecting the frames and would want to reconstruct the frames so that's why longer conversations totally perfect that's it perfect note to close on dinner thank you so much for coming up the podcast for listeners who want to go deeper in daniels work they can check out is it civilization emerging calm [6415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6415.13s)

yeah anything else you want to point them to there is more on the media page in terms of podcast so that's probably the place to start yeah and and then you go down the youtube rabbit hole if you found this interesting you you won't be disappointed then you let you go thank you so much for coming up podcast and talk to you soon thanks for having me who's good if [6433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm9AE-oHlPk&t=6433.52s)
