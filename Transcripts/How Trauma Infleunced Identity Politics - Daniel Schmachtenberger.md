so the issue as i see it is actually quite nuanced and complex and most of the reactionary simplistic takes on it are part of the problem so let's explore this nuance alright cool so let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can look at race we can look at gender we can look at transgender lgbtq we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part of you [26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=26.609s)

learning up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people's color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully [58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=58.05s)

inhabited by lots of nations of people that we completely scarred to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in london we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and [79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=79.32s)

take the whole land there's a real moral  problem - having your moral legitimacy as the united states of america in the beautiful constitution declaration of independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after germany's genocide they're up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more [99](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=99.869s)

people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the native american people employing the slavery of the africans and we mean real slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was [124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=124.59s)

built with a pretty decent amount of chinese slavery a lot of african slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then okay so we abolish [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=151.76s)

slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to go on so then we've got jim crow and segregation and all that and then we kinda overturned that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins [173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=173.9s)

and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people gotta take you know other people have to take the  jobs and who wants the jobs and then you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that just didn't like that right for legit legit understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=193.25s)

that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right well as opposed to people who are coming from [218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=218.93s)

generations of education inheritance and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just trade to [241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=241.1s)

be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice they're a menthe in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there's a symmetry right between you and i which is all cut the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but i don't get a cut and pick right if i could end pic there some up or you can cut an all pic but anyone who says i wouldn't want to trade positions with the other [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=260.96s)

person that they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying [283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=283.38s)

hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and have that [304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=304.59s)

kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alright largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care abouts being threatened and [330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=330.539s)

look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of [354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=354.12s)

imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true cuz it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst i'm [372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=372.27s)

radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking [392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=392.55s)

for menage me and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still [412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=412.38s)

know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet i can show you just as much research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether i'm looking at ph or i'm looking at insulin levels or i'm looking at telomere levels like i'll get different answers and also which populations but when i try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and [433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=433.59s)

there's a million metrics that we can't calculate i can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because i'm studying a very complex system a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really clear that they just don't happen to be all [452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=452.04s)

the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion [474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=474.0s)

and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism just start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a cliff as an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally [495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=495.78s)

true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to avery the way that science imperialism capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism make all kind of co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read foucault or dare at all there's a meaningful good thinking in there [520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=520.53s)

most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when i say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at [540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=540.96s)

the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of feel on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we [568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=568.35s)

don't get to make it through wars so we did in the past and so the idea hey look we thought a war with the british to come get this area and it worked well yeah we have muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we [589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=589.04s)

don't get to make it through wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to  deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the [610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFY5OflSrc&t=610.94s)

successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things while externalizing harm to something else that's effective but actually solved for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part
