music applause music welcome to the high existence podcast where we challenge the way you live we bring you the wisdom and tools to help you grow into a more enlightened version of yourself join us by taking the ultimate life experiment i have 30 challenges to enlightenment course a complete spiritual path to help you [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=31.439s)

overcome the limitations of your mind and to embody the highest philosophical realizations use the code wisdom a check out to get a huge twenty five percent off the course available only to podcast subscribers at store a existence calm i'm your host john waterlow you can find me over on high existence and on my own podcast voices in the dark hi everyone welcome to the high existence podcast before i introduce the guest i just want to circle back to the pre-recorded promo there that you just heard about the thirty challenges to enlightenment i know pre records aren't always the most exciting way to hear about something i want to recommend it myself just on a personal level because it's something that i actually read and worked on whilst i was spending a month in a [76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=76.619s)

buddhist monastery and a hilltop in nepal and believe it or not just by all the teaching all the other reading i was doing it was actually just the handbook that goes with that course that was maybe the most profound insightful and life-changing thing that i experienced worked on and thought about during that month the boys who put it together the high existance team did an incredible [100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=100.38s)

job of pooling together all of their knowledge self growth experience and put it in this format which you can really directly apply into your life and it not only gave me a lot of insight into myself but it showed that so much of what i was learning in the monastery via buddhism is something that goes beyond any particular school of thought from joseph campbell to nietzsche to [122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=122.52s)

psychology books to other self-help manuals a lot of them are kind of saying the same thing in different language and then the 30 challenges course you get it pulled together and you begin to see he finds the ways in which the message can connect to you through the different modalities that they pull in and i definitely recommend you go check it out and with 25% off with that code it's a [144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=144.69s)

really great opportunity and i think there's a free version a little sampler booklet so you can take a look and see for yourself see if it is something that you think would connect for you anyway moving swiftly on our guest this week is daniel sh macton berger of the neuro hacker collective if you haven't heard our first episode with daniel you can go [165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=165.46s)

check it out on the feed if you want to hear more about the macro-level the fate of humanity from ecological economic perspectives what new systems do we need to put in place if we want to preserve our world and ourselves as a species daniel could be introduced in so many different ways as a philosopher a great thinker a strategist someone who can deal as easily with talk about quantum [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=189.31s)

mechanics as he can about the human body and systems that draw the world together and make it function in this particular episode we're talking about how we can make change at the level of you and me we talk about health and it's not just a kind of biohacking podcast that we do talk about neuro hackers principal first big product called qualia which is a nootropic there isn't like most [213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=213.91s)

nootropics that give you a little buzz and then kind of screw up your system qualia is actually specifically made to raise the baseline of the human regulatory systems making you more able to deal with everything in your life down from the biological level up to the consciousness level is how we experience things if you want to try qualia we do have a deal with the neuro hacker [237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=237.01s)

collective and you can go to the show notes click that you get a 10% off offer using the code hi existence my time has tried it out and says it's absolutely phenomenal for him it allows a huge amount of mental clarity but beyond that as you'll hear in this episode it's doing so much more to help you be the best version of yourself but why is it that's kind of the theme of [262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=262.72s)

this episode we talked about how given that we are physically embodied everything that we do is mediated through our biology and therefore we have a responsibility to ourselves and to the world everything that we do to understand that so that we can actually be that version of ourselves put the work out do things that help us connect with other people and the world around [285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=285.22s)

us but most of us we don't really know how our body works and we don't have practices and thought processes which help us to do that daniel unpacks things down at the level of the the key pillars the foundations that we need to put in place in order to be able to be the versions of ourselves that we most want to be so we dig into those foundations there's lots of [307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=307.12s)

practical advice in this on how to alter your life and effectively upgrade yourself but we also reflect on how difficult this is to do and to overcome that resistance in a world or at least in our western societies in which the medical system is essentially set up to treat acute problems without really getting down to what's causing them which can be as simple as a nutrient or [329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=329.409s)

mineral imbalance he breaks that down in language that's so much easier to understand than the kind of deep science that he's actually drawing on and has a significant amount of command over talking about daniel is something that i could do at enormous length and so i'm going to cut it short here and let him speak for himself this is an incredible episode and from a very wise man that [351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=351.94s)

was a real privilege for me to speak to i know you're gonna love it and if you have questions he invites it at the end that he's happy to come back on the show and answer questions directly then email me i think it's probably the easiest thing to do and the address is j waterlow that's j wate rl owa at high existence com let me know what your questions are for daniel will [377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=377.289s)

collect some together and see when we can get him on next time and address those directly now please enjoy the episode hey welcome back daniel shhhhh macton burger to the hi existance podcast this is part 2 strongly advised if people want to hear about the future of the world that they go and listen to the first part where we took a really macro view of where we are [401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=401.02s)

as humanity and where we may be going next and in this part we're going to dive more into the personal development the bio hacking the neuro hacking and how we can develop our cell in order to do anything positive in the world daniels founder @ neuro hacker collective which is a movement dedicated to upgrading our individual and collective capacities and to [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=426.699s)

safeguarding the well-being of all as you would hear in the first episode it's pretty pretty tricky to sum up daniel though i guess is pretty tricky to sum up anyone in a in a fair and rounded way and we had a really great conversation so welcome back and looking forward to this second part thanks for having me it's good to be back i really enjoyed our last conversation so to begin in the [451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=451.12s)

giving we've already got i guess if there were any soft questions in the first one we had them in the first one so we can dive right into the bigger picture here we'll talk about qualia which is the nootropic that have been that's been developed by the neuro hacker collective which is having incredible results for many people martin who joined this last time was [473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=473.889s)

sharing some of his own experiences which were very positively found it very powerful and so we'll get into that but first at the more general level the personal level there's a theme in your work and it's something that a lot of people who read how existence really resonate with it's the idea of taking responsibility for ourselves before we can do anything for others [500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=500.259s)

what does responsibility mean to you and what do you think are the first steps that anyone needs to take in terms of personal responsibility and how perhaps it's the first step is admitting that we haven't been doing so how do we make that first the first step to to find that truth mmm-hmm well in this context more talk about our own physical and mental and psychological and spiritual [528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=528.73s)

health and well-being ultimately if a doctor does a good job or messes up with a procedure or with a drug recommendation or whatever with our health we're going to be the ones who benefit or suffer from it and so we're more invested in the medical care and the psychological care and the health that we get than anyone else's and so it's really a [558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=558.43s)

responsibility we want to take to understand our system well enough that even to the degree we're interacting with professionals that we understand what they're saying we understand the alternatives we understand the consequences we understand that you know risks and upside ratios and if we don't and we just kind of trust an authority to know everything about a topic and [586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=586.84s)

always make good decisions for us and then just be mad at them when they don't it's just not a very empowered approach and you know as soon as you realize that we're already in an exponential information ecology where you've got so many journal articles coming out on any new topic and a clinician is a busy person that's having to mostly see people they can't stay up-to-date with [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=611.11s)

what is new and relevant and there's so many kind of key breakthroughs i don't know in the different european countries that your listeners are in what the stats are but in the united states right not iatrogenic disease meaning disease that is caused by the practice of medicine so interactions from drugs and complications complications from surgery infections about in the hospitals etc is [635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=635.01s)

depending upon what you include in that is either the first leading cause of death in the us or the third and so wow it's a big deal for people to realize that and even the people who aren't dying are mostly you know they are experiencing side effects from other meds or treatments they're on or they just have sub-optimal quality of life because the medical system is mostly not [663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=663.4s)

oriented towards optimizing human flourishing its oriented towards treating acute illness and so if we want to have a really richly flourishing life in all dimensions there are causal dynamics that are associated with health that we can actually progressively understand better and there are choices that we can take they make a huge difference from the [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=691.19s)

foundations of how we sleep and eat and move and process stress and information to what we actually engage in in terms of life extension integrative medicine you know personalized medicine factoring or genomics etc yeah i think if anyone has had more than just a common cold and they've they've been to their doctor it's it can be kind of shocking i've had it a few times where you rapidly realize [722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=722.48s)

that you've the limits of current medical knowledge at least in terms of when you go to a doctor you brush up against them surprisingly quickly and the a lot of i guess it's part of the convenience of seeing so many people they're trying to push you into a flowchart of expected situations and going okay well you've mentioned this symptom so [743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=743.99s)

i'm going to need to prescribe you this and that's kind of the end of the story here i had a a junior doctor friend of mine who gave me some cause for hope who said that here being taught the patients know their condition better than you do and you should listen to them because they also know the history better than you do and can tell you how how things have [763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=763.85s)

gone but even with that more open mind you're suggesting we need to do some of the work ourselves and go looking but there's you know if you type almost any set of symptoms into google you're gonna see a fairly scary and bunch of misinformation mostly how can we try and understand and what is the thing that we should be trusting when we go looking for it ourselves [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=789.86s)

yeah let's understand the problem space a little bit better and then let's understand how people can approach empowered responsibilities well so you said there are limits of knowledge let's not even get to the limits of knowledge first let's just look at the limits of time so then way that modern medical system in most developed nations the way the financial structure of it works [815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=815.14s)

doctors just can't afford to spend much time with people unless it's a concierge in practice where people are paying a huge amount of out-of-pocket money because that doctor racked up a tremendous amount of student loans in the process of learning medicine that they have to pay back and etc right so they if it if a doctor's seen you for five minutes or 15 minutes and sometimes [838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=838.69s)

two minutes for a health issue and sometimes a complex health issue it's not even the limits of knowledge that are gonna be bumped up it's the limits of time to be able to get enough data i have a i have a doctor friend here i actually think is one of the most knowledgeable integrative rheumatologists in the world and really has a profound understanding of causes [862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=862.45s)

of autoimmune disease but as a result his clinic got so inundated with incurable cases that came that he started having shorter and shorter sessions and then i started watching him actually practice really poor medicine because he only had a minute with each person and so we didn't even get to ask the questions that would give him a holistic picture again so the first [881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=881.62s)

thing you can be pretty sure of is that if your doctor isn't getting a really good sense of your whole medical history and your symptom ology and when your symptoms started and how that correspond to different exposures and events that might have happened and looking at really you know good laboratory data and corresponding and seeing that it makes sense they just couldn't possibly have a [905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=905.53s)

decent picture of what to do yeah i think my doc did i try and hold on to even as i move around the place what i like about him as he's always running late and he's running late because he tries to give people the time that they need but obviously there's knock-on consequences for him all right so then let's explore this a little further conventional medicine modern western [933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=933.22s)

allopathic medicine has done a brilliant job of saving a tremendous amount of lives from things that we used to die from that are mostly acute onset illness and it's it's really an exceptional system of medicine for acute cause suffering so if we're talking about injury it's not that we can't do a lot better in the future and we will but anybody who gets in a car accident or [958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=958.85s)

gunshot would much rather go to the er than any other healing system and if you have acute poisoning so dealing with toxicity that is acute high level toxicity or acute infection it's really good at dealing with all that if you have chronic complex illness that did not come on from one acute cause so we're looking at cancer we're looking at autoimmune disease we look at [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=984.23s)

neurodegenerative diseases we're looking at psychiatric disorders it's interesting to know that there's pretty much no actual cures for any of those there are symptom treatments and of course if someone's body is running a cancer we can cut it out we can radiate it out we can poison it out and it's chance of coming back depending upon the kind of cancer is fairly high because we [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1011.11s)

didn't actually understand why the body is growing cancers there in terms of why are cancer cells proliferating more than normal and why did the body's immune response not know how to deal with them effectively it's actually only in the last year or two with the proliferation of immunotherapy is that cancers actually starting to be looked at in a causal way at all chemotherapeutics [1035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1035.29s)

radiation and surgery the only things that have been approved are exclusively symptomatic without addressing why the body's doing this same is true with all of those all those disorders and so one of the reasons is that we we don't have a good type of science for understanding in a very complex system like the human physiology how dis regulation works it's not acute if it's acute it's kind of [1061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1061.54s)

easy to tell they got exposed to this poison and they got sick instantly they got it they you know ate this sushi and they got food poisoning another sick that's kind of straightforward but in there are some things where we have pretty good correlation like someone has you know / eats way too much carbohydrate and we see type 2 diabetes come on there's [1085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1085.9s)

still a pretty straightforward correlation but with the other diseases that i mentioned they're more complex in origin it's because one the cause and effect are very separate in time we have time dilation which makes it very tricky to you have many different causes that are contributing to the disease oftentimes so it's not actually that there is one thing that was wrong it [1109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1109.6s)

might have been some nutrient deficiencies and it's actually really important to talk about this for a minute when we think of nutrient deficiencies in modern nutritional theory related to modern medical theory we think of again an acute level of deficiency such or a level of deficiency such that it causes that a acute disease so if item nc being so low that you get [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1133.27s)

scurvy or vitamin b1 being so low you get berry berry well if you look at where an optimal level of that vitamin s versus where the level is at which you get an acute disease is a pretty big range in between there of suboptimal levels right it's not low enough yet to be a disease state but it's pretty far from where an optimally healthy person is yeah this is icu in terms of [1157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1157.39s)

diagnosis right and so there's a lot of subclinical deficiency that doesn't show up as deficiency because in a disease model it's not yet causing an acute disease but that doesn't mean that it's not causing the regulatory processes of the body that are supported by that particular nutrient to regulate less well well if it's regulating less well you can start having you know all kinds [1182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1182.44s)

of sub adequate regulation occur dickens evangeline tube disease the same is true with subclinical toxicity so someone can have a cute let exposure or mercury exposure where they get sick right away and it's really obviously sick you can look at what the ideal level is which is there's no mercury at all there's a pretty big layer in between which is a much higher amount of [1208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1208.01s)

mercury or lead or cadmium or pcbs or styrenes or whatever life is eight that would have been there in an evolutionary environment but not yet enough of a level that we would call it an acute poisoning or toxicity but it has an effect as it sometimes massive biological effect as a carcinogen or a neurologic disruptor or an occurring disrupter and so now imagine that we [1235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1235.039s)

start stacking these right now imagine that we recognize that in the united states and i imagine it's similar in with a pretty big variance actually in different developed nations when we look at the breast milk mothers in the united states and not mothers in industrial areas but randomized areas we find in the vicinity of 200 different petrochemicals in the breast milk and [1265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1265.76s)

this is things like volatile organic compounds from carpet and paint as well as you know styrenes from the memory foam bed as well as things like organophosphates from the herbicides that are used in agriculture to you know things that come from industrial manufacturing and etc and those all have effects so now you look at a world where or agriculture depletes the topsoil of [1294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1294.86s)

minerals and so we and then we only put back in with our fertilizer just a few main minerals right we put npk back in but we remove all of the 70 to give or take trace minerals so then we get trace mineral e deficient topsoil and the vegetables still look like vegetables or the feed that goes to the livestock still looks like what it is but it's missing really key nutrients that are [1320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1320.539s)

parts of enzymatic process etc so we have you know kind of vick witness nutrient deficiency as a result of agriculture that is not regenerative to the topsoil while simultaneously having adequate exposure to chemicals that were not part of our evolutionary environment and it's kind of an important understand like the detox systems of the body that in detox [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1344.21s)

is kind of a bad word because it's been so abused by fad diets but it's a real thing that your cells are producing metabolic outputs which are the toxin the toxic output of the metabolism and the body gets rid of them the kidneys do that the lungs do that the liver does that as lymphatics are involved etc the exhaling co2 is doing that so our body has detox astons for dealing with things [1371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1371.9s)

that were in its evolutionary environment but glyphosate was not in our evolutionary environment right and neither was like any significant amount of refined heavy metal and so we don't even have good evolved mechanisms to deal with those things so when you start looking at multiple different types of subclinical chronic toxic exposures and deficiencies and psychological stress [1401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1401.89s)

and pathogens and again i'm not talking here about acute pathogenic exposure meaning you have a flu or meningitis i'm talking about dysbiosis in the gut and i think now most people are probably pretty familiar that there are a huge number of interactions outcome well actions that are necessary to make human health that human cells don't do that are symbiotic microbiome does and in an [1434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1434.33s)

evolutionary environment the baby always got the genome of the mom and dad but it also got the microbiome of the mom in particular and so the microbiome and the genome were passed down together genome does not actually code everything necessary to do a human well 80% of our gob was produced in the gut main anti-anxiety neurotransmitter give or take 50% of our dopamine is produced [1460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1460.43s)

bacteria in the gut give or take 50% of serotonin produced by bacteria in the gut vitamin d binding protein that actually is what makes vitamin d able to go into the vitamin d receptors mostly produced by a specific bacteria in the gut so in evolutionary environment again we didn't have antibiotics now this doesn't mean antibiotics haven't save losses lives of course they had but then [1479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1479.029s)

you also throw off and chlorine has helped us in sanitation tremendously save lots of lives but then chlorinated water is also having an effect so you know some people have there's so many different like ways in which to like pick up and go with these these different points that you're making and like like the the over focus on hygiene that potentially leads us to not having [1509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1509.419s)

the kind of immune responses we need or c-sections meaning the babies are not getting yes the microbiome yes of the mother and so on but the what the main thing clanging in my head right now is this is this is kind of scary there's the general genuinely scary and to circle back to the question that i asked just a couple of minutes ago is how can we find the trustworthy information to [1536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1536.75s)

be able to make inform steps because it seems like it's a full-time job to try and be on top of it and there's so and when it's at the the below the threshold where it's a condition that people can clearly say oh you you've got this issue isn't there a big danger that we just run around imagining that we've got this deficiency this deficiency this deficiency and we're just kind of [1559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1559.37s)

guessing and we don't really know yeah so the just in kind of wrapping the major point i was trying to bring there is that when it comes to disease that doesn't have an acute cause oftentimes it doesn't have one cause at all it might be the dysregulation of regulatory systems from exposure to toxins exposure to pathogens dysbiosis in the garden chronic stress [1589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1589.639s)

postural issues lack of movement efficiency and you have one thing that is suboptimal that makes the system regulate slightly less well that makes it more susceptible to other things that are suboptimal you get a vicious cycle and eventually there's enough dysregulation that you actually start to get damaged in certain tissues or certain systems and those cluster [1611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1611.02s)

together and we call it a disease we call it ms or rheumatoid arthritis or whatever but the reason that we haven't had good cures is because we're not gonna find a single cause for we find a number of different things that statistically correlate but none of them statistically correlated enough that treating that one statistical correlation always cures it because [1629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1629.83s)

that's one of a set of a number of things that can be involved in it's not even the same set in everyone so this is a key thing in terms of understanding why we have to take a more complex approach to understanding something as complex as a human body when you're trying to understand issues like aging and issues like chronic disease and on the other side human flourishing [1651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1651.49s)

variable isolation right what is the one thing that is wrong when one drug that will treat it it's just not gonna work so that's it that's important just kind of from an approach point of view so how do we find good resources and how do we approach this well couple things like all areas there's a pretty good pareto principle at 80/20 kind of principle here where if people do a good job with [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1679.419s)

the foundations of well-being they're going to have a lot less disease in their life and the foundations of well-being are relatively straightforward so in order sleep enough and sleep well that's a all the regeneration that happens in the physiology any nutrients that you take in their ability to actually support the genesis of new tissues etc any exercise [1710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1710.01s)

you do the ability for those tissues to regenerate all of that's gonna happen during sleep mostly during delta sleep so sleeping enough and sick and well foundational eating just as a side note before we get to the the next the next part there there's such a cult these days i think about the highest achievement achievers in the world go on for hours sleep and is yeah i wonder [1736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1736.75s)

about that like how are they managing to continue to function and or do some people only need four hours sleep yeah i know a lot of world-class high achievers and almost none of them have four hours sleep most of them actually do a pretty good job of self-care there are people who will push very hard for a period and then burn out and then they're either done with their creative time period or [1766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1766.72s)

they have to learn a new way of being there are people genetically who need less sleep there's a few genes that actually code for more efficient sleep but this is actually a tiny percentage of the population that can that will end up needing in the vicinity of five hours sleep most people genetically do best on something in the vicinity of eight hours [1790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1790.05s)

sleep there's a whole lawn it sleeps a very complex topic in general how do you know if you've slept enough and slept well that you would wake on your own feeling well-rested and energized and you have good energy throughout the day now obviously that's oversimplified because your energy throughout the day is gonna suck even if you slept well if your blood sugar is unstable or if you [1815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1815.11s)

are not exercising which is a key to circulation and generating androgens and things that are necessary but if you are waking tired then there's then sleep is not sufficient yet right so it's deep topic we could do a whole thing on sleep over at our site neural hacker we have up we have a couple whole podcast just on sleep with you know world-class sleep [1840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1840.64s)

researchers and there's a lot of sleep tech that's coming out we're in the process of developing some products for sleep optimization but that's one of the found pilar's okay the other foundational pillar is like everybody knows these but most people have not studied them well enough to know how to optimize them like sleep making sure that you aren't [1863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1863.2s)

exposing yourself to blue light and stimulants in the last little while that you're not exposing yourself to things that have your mind anxious that you do something to relax your body whether it's a hot shower or a hot bath or some stretching before bed that you create a sleeping environment that is dark that it doesn't get disturbed by noise so it has a wait noise generator if needed [1887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1887.979s)

where you're not being disturbed unnecessarily like there's a whole bunch of practices so it's both learn these practices and implement them or deal with the consequences of not having done it which will end up looking like going to doctors for illnesses later the next one is movement and there's a whole lot to get into in terms of what fully optimal [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1917.499s)

movement looks like you can check out real movement specialists like paul check and ido portal who will you know teach you about the difference between strength training and balance training and coordination training and endurance training and why it's important to develop different patterns of movement that stimulate neurogenesis but in which genes get up regulated by different [1945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1945.07s)

kinds of exercise in which brain regions get stimulated but again there's an 80/20 even for exercise which is if you are getting your heart rate up near its maximum for some period of time even a short period of time daily you're gonna do a lot better than if you don't and if you break up being sedentary meaning you aren't sitting for multiple hours on end without movements you get up every hour [1971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1971.619s)

and do a few jumping jacks it doesn't have to be a lot your life will be radically better than if you don't your health will be radically better and again then study more because those who exercise not just more but better really will have a radically higher quality of life you drop body fat percentage and you dropped all cause mortality etc diet is the next one which is as much as you [1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=1999.24s)

can take in foods that look like parts of your evolutionary environment meaning things that are not highly processed and as much as you can avoid things that are highly processed that's the good first rule of thumb it's not perfect obviously there are plants that are poisonous obviously you can have a protein powder that is processed that's actually good for you there's there's a lot of good books on nutrition where you can dive deeper but if you just start by thinking okay well we evolved to have a diet that had a lot of plants but not a lot of the same plant right we would have had different plants and different seasons and they would have been a hunter-gatherer environment been just little bits of lots of different types all that have [2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2048.47s)

different nutrients so can i do a variety of different kinds of plants and animal products and they should should be organic it should not be covered in pesticides meaning that if you spray a chemical toxic enough to kill things like ants and cockroaches on your food and then eat it that's kind of silly and should come from as well and maintain soil as possible so if you can get even [2071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2071.84s)

better than organic if you can find local farmers that do biodynamic farming [[permaculture]] farming even better and as much as it sounds like that's fancy all it is is trying to get a little bit closer to what all food was before the industrial revolution it is it's it's fancy exactly that it can be expensive like i remember i live for a little while in the us and i found it was [2095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2095.419s)

really expensive to try and buy things that seem to be labeled organic or to shop in whole foods i am i think it is maybe a bit easier in some countries in europe and unless the labeling system is misleading but there is is there kind of a barrier of entry that's based on money for a lot of people here no yes going to whole foods can be expensive there's a couple ways to look [2122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2122.06s)

at this one if you find your local farmers markets because they aren't having to pay to have a big-box store with lots of i mean they're basically disintermediating the grocery store part you can get even fresher better quality food cheaper and cheaper than what you would pay for the conventional agriculture at a normal store the conventional produce so the cost really [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2145.25s)

can be dealt with the produce is usually not that expensive the things that are expensive in places like whole foods usually are the healthy packaged foods and pre-made foods the produce is a little bit more expensive but it's still like not super expensive and there's a whole bunch of reasons why farmers markets and coops are like really valuable things to explore so that's one [2171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2171.41s)

topic on cost yeah it also sounds fun to be able to to go there rather than just be in another supermarket it is fun you're supporting local farmers to actually get paid better than they get paid other places which and especially the ones that are doing organic and [[permaculture]] which supports environmentalism in agriculture and [[climate change]] dynamics and micro economies and it's like this is just every reason that's a good thing to do and yes you can start to actually make friends in the community there and have this fun experience of what you know markets have been for a lot of human history so that's a way that cost is not a barrier of entry the other thing though is you know when we say solar is more expensive than coal energy wise and [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2220.07s)

that solar still needs to get cheaper to be at grid parity with coal in some areas it's just complete nonsense because 99% of the cost of coal energy is just the coal company doesn't have to pay for it so they don't internalize it into the cost of coal it's externalized to the commons in the form of co2 and mercury mercury vapor and nitrous oxide and zinc oxide and the mountain [2251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2251.18s)

removal mining that it took to get it and the like it there is a massive cost to all people to the environment to future generations to whatever that if you had to say hey burn coal but just don't leave the environments worse as a result so whatever it takes to clean up the effects in real time do that and if it costs some money to do that you have to include that in the cost of coal coal [2274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2274.989s)

would go up by the price of coal would go up by hundreds or thousands of times and solar would have been that grid parity the moment it existed so and the same is true in health care i can eat shittier foods that are cheap but there's a cost and it's a cost that's being externalized to the decreased health of my future and so then i'm gonna have to pay the medical [2301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2301.539s)

and or just have a shorter or shittier life and so it becomes important to think about what does cost really mean and what is actually worth investing in right yeah so cost we can think of it's not just a financial cost but there can be the other and until i think it's a it's a funny human thing that we tend to ignore that sort of personal cost until it actually hits us even though we have [2331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2331.539s)

all the evidence to see if you see someone who smoked their whole lives and didn't think about it then the cost becomes evident later we say over and over again but seem to have trouble when it comes to ourselves humans suck at this topic everywhere and it's why we are so close to self-induced extinction as a species which is short term gain and long term expense and there's some [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2357.339s)

reasons why we suck at it is in and have in our evolutionary environment pre advanced technological capabilities we just didn't have the ability to affect our own feature negatively that much it's this is actually an important thing to understand in our evolutionary environment 250,000 years of being homeless and something like 8 million [2382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2382.119s)

years of hominid history before the plow and you know grains refined carbohydrates etc for that whole time period there was not an easy way to get sugar fat or salt right sugar every once while you'd find some berries but the berries that we see today are radically hybridized from the heirloom berries back then that were like a few on a very thorny bush for a very small amount of [2410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2410.17s)

time and you're in competition with the birds right and and honey is a super hard thing to actually deal with the bees in that kind of world so are there sugar there's such tiny little bits of sugar the same is true with access to salt in most environments and the same is true with access to fats because you know getting game every time you go out after big game you can die in the [2435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2435.219s)

process of hunting with spears and it's mostly pretty lean meat right so whenever we did have access to those things they conferred so much evolutionary advantage in terms of the caloric density of fat and sugar made it easier to live through a famine and the ability of salt to replenish electrolytes and elbows keep water on in hot environments so we had a major we [2462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2462.249s)

evolved to have a strong dopamine response when we would eat those foods meaning as it's actually important to get that those that had a stronger dopamine response meaning a pleasure reward circuit actually survived better because they worked harder to go find those foods and then they made it through famines better right so we're the descendants of the people that have [2485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2485.17s)

the strongest dopamine responses to those foods now post-industrial revolution we have made so much abundance of sugar fat and salt but our evolutionary genetic response to those hasn't changed so now we're dying of obesity rather than starvation and so it was important to get that evolutionary response of getting this major pleasure head when you eat sugar fat salt and ideally all three together right like imagine almost every fast-food meal if you do the whole meal is all three of those together and you get such a such a dopamine flood that you become addicted and you can't not eat it even though you know that you are decreasing the quality of your life in on every metric your social life your sexual life your health [2531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2531.19s)

life your ability to generate finance your emotional life everything as you are doing that more and so we actually had an evolved set of responses that were appropriate to an environment and then we became these amazing tool makers and we changed our environment faster than we could be genetically adapted to so we have to actually know how to navigate this built world that we've [2552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2552.64s)

made that is actually not a natural environment to us still being the genetic creatures that we are and this is why those you know the two marshmallow experiments of the kids that had better delayed gratification and impulse control doing better in every area of life my impulse control ends up being a really really big part of the whole picture here but when you when you [2576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2576.22s)

look at the fact that natural selection mostly selected for things that were adaptive in the moment who ever could you know not lose it that fight made it through etc that's a short-term orientation and we mostly couldn't do things that damage the long-term that much meaning overfish the entire ocean or eat foods that would make us totally ill chronically or and so we're in a [2603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2603.369s)

position now where when you look at people's health and whether it's the smoking situation you talked about or the getting to exercise later and it never happens or [[climate change]] or the fact that we knew fukushima was going to have a earthquake five years before it happened and nobody wanted to spend the money this quarter on buffering against it our orientation towards short-term [2626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2626.83s)

ease and short-term gain at probable possible long-term expense is one of the main things that if we want to survive as a species and if we have a good quality of life as individuals we have to get past so if you if listeners want to hear you know biohacking secrets or heaps of biohacking secrets that we can share what ends up mattering like more than [2651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2651.49s)

any of those is being able to get good at making decisions that are good from a long-term focus yeah i think that's something about the tyranny of the quarterly financial report that is kind of mirrors and maybe feeds back into on the individual level that we think about what i want now rather than what i want in the future and if we if we want to get into making better choices i want to [2676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2676.81s)

i want to talk about qualia the neuro hackers flagship products sure real quick one one more thing in that they just want to share that i think i think you guys will appreciate it one application of vr tech that i thought was really beautiful and it's it's in development i don't know the name of a company that's developing it but they're doing vr avatars and so you have cameras [2705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2705.64s)

get the right pictures of you to render you as an avatar then you can go into the earth space see yourself as an avatar and one of the things that was done was age progression where you could see a version of yourself as an older person while you're a younger person but it's actually you right like you're looking in the mirror you lift your left hand and you watch your hand move and so [2728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2728.38s)

you get a look at yourself as this older person be like whoa that's me and then it will do the age progression based on how you're eating how you're exercising if you're smoking etc and you can actually watch the 60 year old version of you look different habits the yellowness of its teeth so the skin the health of vitality that everything looked different based on the lifestyle [2750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2750.88s)

habits based on real data of how those things statistically work and one of the things that happened in some of the research was that as people were relating with the older version of themselves because right now the idea of ourselves as older people is just a completely abstract topic but us now is totally real and visceral and we feel or hunger now we don't feel [2775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2775.03s)

our fatness as an older person right or our body pain or whatever it is and so it's easier to make decisions based on something concrete than something abstract something that we're feeling in real time versus something that you know it's hard to actually even imagine a relate with so as they were doing it these people started making concretely tangibly better choices for their [2799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2799.45s)

long-term life because they had a clearer relationship with that being one of them was actually financial that the people today who were younger started saving money more as they were relating with their older avatar and another one's health decision so even if you don't have access to that vr just just thinking about it hearing it can be useful yeah i think that that personal [2821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2821.17s)

confrontation sounds really interesting and i'm i'm finding just in myself really it's making an impact on me to be my early 30s to realize my body is not working as well as it used to and to not just kind of despair and accept that as i think i know a lot of older people who just go well you know that's how it is you get older and everything hurts more and things don't work so well but we can [2847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2847.15s)

actually make some differences we can make some changes which can actually affect us positively and i guess one of the the main ones is that the conscious input of better things into our bodies in the way that you describe just in terms of food but when it comes to the world of biohacking which is ever more widespread it seems to me there's there's a lot to talk about by hacking [2875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2875.46s)

i'm like trying to formulate three questions at once i guess it'd be better to start by saying ask for like your two minute description of what qualia is and then we can really dig deeper into it yeah so quality is a nootropic which means some chemistry that enhances cognitive function different aspects of cognitive function beyond one's previous baseline without causing negative side [2900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2900.19s)

effect that's the general best accepted definite nootropic there's different classes of chemicals that are the primary classes of nootropics that you know are generally well studied and so this is what a nootropic stack meaning a blend of different chemical supplements that affect different neurotransmitters different pathways different aspects of [2924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2924.42s)

neuro chemistry and biochemistry to enhance the underlying physical substrate that supports cognitive process and so why did we create it it's the first of a bunch of products that all have the same design philosophy and methodology the next ones will be launching early this next year but when we started this we saw this kind of meteoric exponential rise of the use of [2955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2955.89s)

smart drugs and specifically even illegal off-label smart drugs we're talking about adderall modafinil riddlin vyvanse wellbutrin and mostly dopaminergic but some some other categories and we saw averell do an estimated five billion dollars in illegal sales in the us per year when we started smart drugs as a whole - about 15 billion dollars that's just [2986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=2986.43s)

domestically right so internationally a lot more and this is because people were had such strong pressure to perform and produce and really wanted to while simultaneously having so much that was damaging their ability to focus from all of the [[social media]] kinds of distractions to gut brain access being out like we talked about where 50% dopamine is produced and the nutrient [3017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3017.27s)

and deficiencies in toxicities and etc and you know then other than people going to off-label smart drugs we also saw you know energy drinks where people were doing 300 and 400 milligrams of caffeine and you know caffeine is a cool molecule qualy has a very small amount of caffeine and a unique form in it because it's a really neat central nervous [3045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3045.71s)

system stimulant if we have caffeine bound to an antioxidant from blueberry skin called taro still being that affects the pharmacokinetics of it so it releases much slower so you don't get a jolt and then a drop you get a very slow central nervous system release over a longer period of time but that is it also helps the uptake of some of the other more specifically active neural [3068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3068.27s)

chemistry but at those kinds of doses this is really not a healthy relationship with caffeine and you start getting you know you'd get increased focus and attention and alertness to a certain point and then the jitteriness and inability to focus starts getting a negative response curve and a central nervous system stimulant like caffeine or a dopamine enhancer like adderall [3093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3093.74s)

are really only affecting a very narrow range of the total aspects of chemistry that are important for cognitive enhancement and so one of the things that you find is when people are going to those kinds of solutions is that they they work right like people are taking them for their midterms or their finals or their tech startup or for their gaming or whatever because they actually [3119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3119.69s)

can focus better longer concentrate and they have more motivation but one of the things very interesting is some of the other cognitive capabilities that you would want online at the same time there are studies that actually show they go down so different aspects of memory like total working memory goes down on that role and creativity goes down and the ability for fluid intelligence and task [3144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3144.44s)

switching goes down and it happens to be that empathy goes down for most people and irritability anxiousness depersonalization go up and so that's one problem is that it's a very narrow set of positive effects the other problem is that your body regulates dopamine right your nervous system regulates dopamine in a very kind of kampala [3169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3169.849s)

this way and you don't want fixed high dopamine levels all the time you do want your body to be able to up regulate its dopamine when you're doing and dopamine there's a kind of task like working on a project and then you want it to be able to chill when you want to go play with your kids or cuddle or something else and so rather than take a chemical that externally exogenously overrides an [3190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3190.0s)

endogenous regulatory process and then the process of doing that it actually creates dependence and addiction which most medicines that affect the brain and mind end up doing we're much more interested in understanding how the regulatory process has worked and providing chemistry that supported the regulatory processes to be able to regulate better so that you could [3217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3217.22s)

actually up regulate endogenous regulatory capacity because we can actually define health when we're talking about disease earlier we can actually define health as the robustness of the regulatory capacity of the system which means that any kind of issue can come up any kind of deviation from homeo dynamics and the system can actually respond to it and so we wanted to work [3236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3236.66s)

on increasing the regulatory capacity of the system so that rather than causing addiction meaning the person was on it for a while they get off and that were screwed we wanted it to be that if someone was on any product we made for a while then they got off that they would actually have lasting benefit in terms of elevation of some positive functions from the baseline before they started [3259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3259.97s)

and that's true for koala industry for although other products that were making its the design methodology and so with quality the way we started was we said okay when people are seeking cognitive enhancement what are they really seeking it's not just cognitive it's usually emotional cognitive psychologic energetic together right there they're seeking focus and concentration and [3280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3280.49s)

attention those dynamics and memory the ability for working memory to hold more in their memory and their speed of recall verbal fluency you know etc and they want increased analytic capabilities and synthesis capabilities and creativity they also want to increase motivation and dry and emotional resilience and they also want some complex things that are like [3305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3305.67s)

the dialectic of pretty opposite things which is i want the ability to concentrate really hard on one topic and not get distracted while simultaneously having the ability to task switch from one thing to another thing what i need to do that it's like we're asking for a magic pill to fix everything here well has nothing to do the magic pill it's that a well regulated system is good at [3328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3328.619s)

shifting modes right like that's what adaptiveness is and an adaptive creature can go from sleeping to waking can go from very different kinds of states and the quicker that one can go between different modes and the better they can be in those modes as the adaptiveness of the creature and so what we wanted to support was the overall adaptiveness so if we were just driving the chemistry of [3356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3356.609s)

focus and concentration it would make task-switching worse we could drive things that would support task switching may focus worse to make both better you have to not be exogenous lis driving the chemistry in one direction or the other but supporting the regulatory processes and so this was you know this is kind of at a high level but this is our design philosophy for [3380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3380.13s)

how we wanted to approach anything in the health and well-being space is let's make sure that we are well and specifically in the enhancement space biohacking so often isn't looking at the disease model but the enhancement side and again modern medicine that's one of the other differences is that it is a disease model process so it's really not looking at optimization so why we mapped [3406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3406.17s)

all those things to start was to say you know people really don't just want to increase focus well being more irritable and less creative and with less code emery they want this whole suite of things together that means that they have increased creative productive capacity and flow and so then we said all right well what do we know in any of the various [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3437.079s)

biosciences human biosciences about the physiologic processes that mediate those cognitive and subjective dynamics what do we know about the neural chemistry that mediates focus that mediates task-switching memory i/o etc and so we started to map those processing some are acetylcholine mediated right some have to do with the nmda complex some have to do with how [3467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3467.17s)

catecholamines process some have to do with sodium ion dynamic so we were mapping these and saying how does the body regulate those on its own can we draw the regulatory processes and then why does the body get less good at regulating because of course kids actually have this ability to focus on something they're interested in and also tasks which and fall asleep pretty [3489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3489.819s)

quickly and then be energetic right like that's adaptiveness so starting to look at why does why does a system have decreased capacity to do those things what are the rate limiting factors in the system and what can we offer to support the system's capacity to do that better so like just as a for instance if your listeners are interested in example let's just say we take dopamine that [3516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3516.339s)

we're talking about earlier rather than give you know something like an n feta mean right at 11:00 p.m. feta mean it is a enchained dopamine agonist where you get a big rush of dopamine but it is decoupled from changing acetylcholine levels or glutamate or looking at how the other catecholamines you're focused or the neuro inhibitory chemicals or anything else and it doesn't look at the [3541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3541.99s)

whole process of how the body normally regulates dopamine so you do get down regulation addiction we said well how does the body normally do dopamine creation and there's this whole complex process of how protein is broken down into amino acids and phenyl alanine is converted and the tyrosine is converted into an acetyl tyrosine is converted into l-dopa crosses the blood-brain [3562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3562.779s)

barrier is kin the dopamine travels down an axon crosses the synapse has to cross a whole bunch of different kinds of enzymes to break it down into synapse and then goes into one of multiple dopamine receptors that affect how it's processed you have to have the right dynamics happening in the cell the krebs cycle process is to have enough energy to process that some [3582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3582.75s)

of it will hydroxylase into norepinephrine you map this whole thing out and then say how can we support each step in that process and so then we have you know what are the vitamins what are the amino acids what of minerals were the different dynamics convert one step to the other step it can be at suboptimal levels that lead to rate limiting in those processes and so we [3604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3604.29s)

made a database of like 500 chemicals that were associated with the underlying physiology of all of those subjective states and capabilities and then we started paring it down in terms of which ones are you know well tolerated and have positive synergies with other ones and don't have negative synergies and support each step in the various pathways and you know that led to an [3630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3630.9s)

initial hypothesis of how to make something with things that we wanted to test do we need more or less choline donor in this more or less dopamine agonist in here etc and that led to about a hundred iterations with testing and we gave qualia and we've done preclinical tests where in clinical trials now but we did preclinical is preparing for the clinicals where we did [3658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3658.02s)

people's cue eeg brain scans as well as a bunch of biometrics like hrv and ethnography and etc and psychometrics and cognitive metrics before people took it and then once they did quality of just once and then once they were on it for a month and we saw really awesome results the data set was too small we only had that single blinded so i won't speak to the numbers yet we're gonna [3687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3687.99s)

speak to him once the the full double-blind did large larger scale clinical trial comes out but you know and we would of course have dunh larger trials earlier on except they're expensive and yeah trying to pay for all of it is a tricky thing and this is worth like we could have taken more venture capital money earlier but then we would have been more beholden to have [3710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3710.36s)

to maximize profits as per their goals and we really wanted to do something that we could really control with what our own capacity to fund was so that we could keep making the highest quality things so like for instance our cost of goods just the raw material costs for us on this is more expensive than the retail price of most metrics and it's because being like you know we have a [3736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3736.67s)

versions of each ingredient like benefit i mean version of be one for the effect on peripheral neurons that we wanted is something like a hundred times more cost per kilo than if i mean that is the normal form would be one that you could put but we have those kind of expensive forms because it was the one - that should do what we wanted now we're trying to get the cost down through [3761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3761.51s)

economies of scale but that was longer than two minutes what we were trying to do with quality and what it really is clearly a super complex i mean even beyond the super complexity of the ingredients in there it's a very complex and deep thinking approach that you've taken so it kind of already sidesteps a lot of the the reservations that people have about biohacking and nootropics [3787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3787.64s)

where there tends to be some sort of downside some kind of burnout element which you've already said this is you know from the foundation up is not what qualia is about well i also wonder when when i think and people i know who try to take supplements to enhance their performance one way or another it does seem to still matter what it is that they want to do when they take it so i [3812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3812.33s)

mean accrue a crude example can be you could take modafinil fired a pretty unhealthy relationship with modafinil for much of a year a few a few years in the past and after a time i realized but i still kept doing it that i would take it because i would feel like i was on and i felt like i'm great i'm doing great stuff i'm really focused but if i really broke it down [3838](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3838.28s)

and looked at it i wasn't achieving anything you can take it to get the sensation of being on it but then do nothing so yeah it's is there does this still play a factor in in taking qualia because if you're if you're just taking it but without any sort of purpose in mind is that enough it's a tool right and there is right use of tools somebody can use a hammer wrong [3864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3864.26s)

and break their thumb or they can use a hammer ray in buildings and so and to the other point somebody can build things that aren't worth building so those modafinil towers that i built i mean it's a classic thing where somebody is using meth and there's just cleaning their grout with a toothbrush because they have a tremendous amount of energy that needs to do something but they're [3893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3893.81s)

not really clear on whether the super useful thing to do would be so if someone already is sleeping well is exercising well as meditating as dealing with stress well has a empowering outlook on life is clear on what they want to create and then they add qualia to that it's gonna be a much different experience than if someone is thinking in ways and living in ways that have [3922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3922.85s)

them aggressive and scattered and etc and they take quality like that they're not going to instantly just know what to do with their lives because they have some neurochemical support so in general i would encourage people to do the foundational things before i would have them do any kind of more advanced biohacking that said there's an exception to that that i've seen which [3942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3942.83s)

is there are a lot of people who just can't do the things they know will make a difference for them there the habit patterns the addiction patterns have just been too strong they beat themselves up for not exercising but they just you know many years of wanting to and it's still not happening and we've had a lot of people and i [3966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3966.27s)

can't make any claims about this but we've had many people tell us that they took qualia and then after years of wanting to exercise and not they started exercising or they started eating well or they started doing things that they actually felt that they had increased energy and motivation and capacity to do that they they were just overwhelming and daunting previously and so yeah my [3986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=3986.46s)

general recommendation we do the foundational things first unless there's difficulty with the foundational things and you want to see if this is an experiment that can increase your capacity to do it yeah it sounds a bit like some of the effects of a regular meditation practice where you certainly in my experience i end up finding that there's more sort of space [4010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4010.4s)

and energy and capacity in myself to set about doing things that i want to do but usually provoke a kind of it feels like fear i think quite often the onerous task or it's like the kind of paradox of procrastination in a way the thing the is causing you so much stress and grief you keep looking in the other direction because it causes stress and grief and yet the only way to change that is to go [4037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4037.76s)

and do the task it's kind of the obviously later instinct is this is related to that topic we're mentioning earlier about delayed gratification so there's the other side of that is facing difficult things now and in general the degree to which we can put off ease full and pleasurable things till later and face more difficult things now we will have a more meaningful higher quality [4070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4070.1s)

and actually more pleasurable life this is actually an important point let's let's touch on this one little show okay so i take the chocolate cake in the moment and i'm getting a flood of dopamine erick responds to take this oh good it feels awesome and i'm not actually feeling myself increased inflammation or store body fat or have dysregulated blood sugar or whatever in [4099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4099.72s)

the moment i'm just feeling awesome right tasting this and so in the moment the chocolate cake is absolutely increasing my pleasure but it is doing those other things that i said and so it's going to if i'm eating the chocolate cakes more often i will have a life with more inflammation more unstable blood sugar which means lower energy and mood issues and etc all of [4125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4125.1s)

which will lead to a life that has less pleasure when you factor the entire cause and effect set right right and because having shitty energy and unstable mood and inflammation is less pleasure but then when your pleasure is low you and you're feeling really shitty then you crave anything that will make you feel better again in the moment so that that that's the addiction cycle [4150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4150.299s)

right and so in blood sugar is a classic example you take something that spikes your blood sugar you feel really good but then it also crashes your blood sugar then once your blood sugar's crashed you're kind of desperate and so you will go for sugary things it will raise it again when have you eaten something that wasn't sugary earlier you would have never had your blood sugar [4172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4172.41s)

crash in the first place and been stable so the addiction cycle is a cycle of hyper stimulus the dis regulates baseline that leads to more desire for hyper stimulus right yeah and it's possible to have some of that attitude towards exercise if you get on the exercise wagon but then that also can lead to an addiction the over exercise because you're getting your kick but [4197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4197.97s)

probably still avoiding something okay so i'll get to that in a minute but let me tell the other part of this food analogy because then we'll be able to relate it so let's say instead of the chocolate cake i'm looking at eating a salad the salad is not gonna give me the same dopamine flood in the moment the chocolate cake did even if it's a good salad right for [4219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4219.48s)

the fat sugar salt reasons we mentioned earlier and that said as i'm doing the salads regularly i will have a body that is more mobile that has more energy that has less fatigue that has less blood sugar crashes it has less excessive weight and that all translates to a body whose baseline pleasure is higher right and so the opposite of the addiction cycle is something that does not spike [4252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4252.21s)

your pleasure but that doesn't destabilize and decrease your baseline and that leads to slowly up regulating baseline and so here's the the difference addictive things spike your pleasure and then crash it and then it spikes then it crashes but the baseline lowers two things you both get more highs and lows and progressively more lows in the [4278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4278.85s)

addiction cycle in the healthy cycle with anything you get less extreme highs and lows and progressively more highs right that's a kind of difference in the relationship and so what's interesting is while the addict is controlled by pleasure they actually have much less pleasure in their life right because the baseline is is very different right and so when we're talking about what is [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4306.59s)

healthy we're actually also talking about what is more pleasurable now you mentioned exercise and you mentioned it as a addiction and also has an avoidance can someone exercise because they hate their body and they're fat and disgusting and they need to exercise as almost like a form of bulimia right yeah totally i can eat and throw up or i can eat and then go [4336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4336.0s)

exercise body hatred now is is that radically different than being grateful to be alive and get to create and have experience and that all of that only gets to happen because i have a body and so i want to take good care of this vessel that i'm in yeah it's a totally different motivation right and one of them happens after binging and one of them happens just [4360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4360.17s)

because it's a good thing to do and you know and one might happen so that i can avoid feeling certain things and the other one is happening just to support feeling good in my body so the motivation and how one relates to anything can determine sex can be addictive or it can be healthy and healing meditation can be actually a way to avoid dealing with real in one's [4384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4384.81s)

life yeah some people just get that and float tanks as well it can they can be incredibly powerful tools again tools or if you spend like 10 hours a day and a float tank what what exactly are you doing that for well i see so many people who will pray for world peace and not do anything that actually tangibly makes the world better and you know in a way that is worse than not doing because it [4420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4420.69s)

if they didn't do it the pain of not contributing to what they cared about might make them find something actually you know tangible they could do but the reason they do that is because they don't know what the to do about [[climate change]] or about species extinction it's too painful and they can't do nothing and so that's something they feel like they can do but it is [4446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4446.16s)

then importantly kind of a avoidance of something rain the bypass of something yeah exactly yeah there's i'm wondering when so individual motivation is important too but then we also have individual biology and i wondered even if you've tried to create the most rounded product in qualia they're still certain person's specific rhythms and biology [4477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4477.949s)

that we can't overcome such as the times of day where we enter flow state so i know from what i've read and some of your profiles online the you're definitely a night owl and right now we're talking it quite late night where you are early morning i'm like my i feel like i'm definitely a very low capacity when i end up in like the the late night is that something that can just an [4506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4506.19s)

example i guess of something that we can't really change at the individual level all right that was a few different questions that i heard one is an is qualia appropriate for everyone or do we need personalized chemistry and then are there things that we can't change with our physiology and that needs to be personalized so on the topic of personalization first with word equality [4532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4532.8s)

its quality of the right chemistry for everyone totally not it was the best that we could do at making something that worked for worked well for the most people interested in that thing and it was actually much better than i thought we'd be able to do because you know my background and starting to explore it was based on full personalization so working in integrative medical clinics [4554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4554.36s)

with you know different kinds of innovative doctors helping design customized chemistry and neural chemistry support but we got to actually see people's labs see their qejy have the medical history and and so i got to see how much we could actually help people feel radically better not just in terms of cognitive enhancement but in terms of [4581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4581.369s)

their psychological being and yeah all that i wasn't sure what we would be able to do without personalization and i was really curious because if there were things that we could do that were meaningful to wide audiences that obviously would allow us to bring support to a lot more people and the cost of the personalization work was so prohibitive [4605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4605.01s)

music so we were able to find that with there are certain axes that are so sensitive one person to the next or a different kind of genetic clusters different phenotypes that i just don't include them in quality of won't use them in any of our products so like for instance you'll see we don't have folic acid because whether you use folic acid or [4629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4629.42s)

you use some version of methylated folic acid is there are so many people in each of the groups and it makes such a big difference whether they are over or under methylating on that particular axis that is just something without personalization i don't mess with because i because i couldn't actually do it for a wide audience effectively and so we work with axes that are pretty [4656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4656.349s)

commonly supported by the same things for everybody the right krebs cycle intermediaries that up greg you late atp production in that being pretty great for everybody and for the people that are seeking cognitive enhancement supporting their acetylcholine processing and supporting their dopaminergic processing and then also supporting neurogenesis and [4676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4676.58s)

synaptogenesis ends up being pretty effective across the board and so those are the ones that we work with now there are still you know there's something like 80% of the people that have tried quality of it had a good response and felt that it was meaningful for them and something like half of those that it was like life-changing the positive for and other ones it was just you know [4703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4703.82s)

enhancing and then of the 20% that don't have great experiences they're mostly knoll experience they just don't experience much of it yeah and that's usually either because they have sleep issues or digestive issues that we've found in the tens of thousands of people that have used it and given those feedback so far and there are a few people that don't and neither of those [4727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4727.099s)

are true and just not chemistry they need so where the person personalization is right for everybody no but a lot of people that's why we offer up you know people can try it if it doesn't work get your money back kind of thing now we are working on rolling out a doctor program right now where for people who either do have real medical issues that [4755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4755.64s)

they want to address or real psychiatric issues because we're not treating we're not doing medicine we're just you know providing enhancement tools or they want to do enhancement that is customized that we have doctors trained in integrative medicine and the integrative neuropsych and we're bringing additional protocols to them that can actually help test people and do really good work so [4778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4778.17s)

when you really good personalized work so when you're asking how do you know what good resources are we're working on curating doctors that really can do a good job of psychiatry and psychopharmacology both you know and and not just what we think of as psychiatry but neurochemical optimization and that would be cool in the meantime i would say if people are interested the [4804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4804.3s)

integrative doctors it's it's hard because some of them are awesome and some of them are terrible but at least the integrative doctors are working on understanding personalization and root cause in a deeper way than just what med is going to be given for this symptom in general the institute for functional medicine doctors seem to be getting pretty well trained but finding finding [4834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4834.51s)

someone you actually like and resonate with who'll spend time and it seems knowledgeable is a is a valuable tool yeah next part i'm sorry hon you gonna do you want to respond to that or do you want me to go on to the circadian rhythms partner oh i'm definitely interested in this acadian rhythms yeah where people start katie rhythms fixed or are they changeable [4861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4861.42s)

different opinions on this there is a hypothesis that circadian rhythms are have a strong genetic component and that there are the morning larks the kind of normal people and the night owls and that you have give or take 70% of people who have a normal circadian rhythm that basically you know wakes in the in the morning of light and about 15% of the people that wake much earlier and 50% of [4898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4898.14s)

people to stay awake much later and the evolution and biology story is that there always had to be some people awake in evolutionary environments for tribes to be safe some watchmen and that there is a genetic predisposition to be in those groups i don't know how solid that is i know there are some genes that are correlated but we all obviously also know people [4921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4921.59s)

who were night i was when they were teenagers or in college and now they work a job where they wake up at 5:00 a.m. every day most people can adapt their schedule fairly well most people also if they control artificial lighting and stimulants and exercise like that most people do better on earlier schedule than a later schedule no i'm saying that at 1:00 a.m. my time yeah [4949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4949.29s)

it's like ass to me when i hop off here i'm hopping on to another meeting the rules of thumb like that are really good starting places and then personal exploration is important because i've had very early schedules and later schedules and i actually do better on later schedule and so it is valuable for people to explore what works best for them well part of the underlying [4978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=4978.63s)

question there is like it so it can be changed potentially maybe maybe not but also why why do we want to change it and i think that can be down to the the personal needs so if you're in a relationship with someone i experienced this in the past y-you seem to be on the opposite timetables that can be remarkably destructive and can also seem to be a case that somebody [5002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5002.27s)

has to compromise for somebody else so it can be much more personal as opposed to simply you know put the practical case of i need this kind of job ya can be that mmm it can be someone starts a spiritual practice where they are in a meditation group at 4 a.m. i think almost everybody when they have kids gets a different sort ad and rhythm than they had before because they are [5035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5035.54s)

gonna wake up whatever time their kids come in so lots of lots of reasons there but i will say getting enough sleep is critical and in general also getting enough light during the day is critical and most people like i said do better if they're waking up with with sunlight so waking up in the dawn vicinity and then getting an earlier bed and a regular bedtime those are the general starting [5069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5069.02s)

recommendations that any sleep expert will give you and and then like i said some percentage of the people will find that they do better or have personal reasons like you said to do otherwise so again we're back to the importance of sleep in and of itself and we also talked about how to get better nutrition into our bodies when it comes to the the other element that can make the [5096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5096.32s)

difference to absorbing these things that was the the gi piece that you mentioned and for those possibly including me what are there some basic steps to get a sense of if there is a problem in the microbiome and what can be done short of going into a specialist lab which i think in most cases is not immediately available or affordable are there some steps that we can take [5121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5121.34s)

yeah so for most people there are dietary things they can do that will help their gut if they notice that they are having gi symptoms they're having gas or bloating or tenderness in their abdomen or constipation or diarrhea or upper gi issues acidity etc it gets complex and the you know the allopathic answer is to say you have ibd and which can't you so many things not that that's [5156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5156.01s)

not that descriptive or useful right be integrative approaches to the function medicine approaches to try and figure out what's going on and is it a food allergy is it dysbiosis as it actually pathogens bacteria parasite etcetera many of which even when they're there that the tests have a lot of false negatives so it's kind of tricky to figure it out so the foundational things one can do someone can do an elimination diet and you can read online at how to do an elimination diet where you eliminate the foods that people commonly react to so you eliminate the gluten grains the dairy the soy corn and sugar and you know but different people react to different things so when you're doing elimination diets there's different [5210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5210.3s)

things you can eliminate and then after you know some period of time off of them see do their symptoms get better if so then reintroduce the foods one at a time see which one kicks the symptoms on and you start to get some insight this is a way people can experiment on their own with what foods your bothersome the ones i mentioned are ones that are classically bothersome for a lot of [5230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5230.89s)

people and there are people who have bad gi reactions to plants to have leptin sensitivities but you know the gluten thing is obviously a very heated controversial difficult topic for the most part the gluten sensitivity the food insensitive thing is not just a marketing ploy and/or like a some weird fad it is largely the result of ubiquiti ifas 8 use on wheat and so it's not [5267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5267.83s)

actually gluten itself it's this associated dynamic there's a law we could get into there and there's a lot of books that are critiquing grains and why there are problems with grains the paleo world is pretty big into this where people can study further but there are also a lot of people who leave the u.s. go to europe and find that they can eat bread and pasta when they're in many [5294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5294.86s)

european countries and they come back here and they can't and it actually does have to do with different agricultural methods in different countries so again you can explore that topic but cutting out hard to digest foods and foods you might be reacting to and finding which ones you react to is a first major step some other steps that are worth noting is not overeating it's kind of a major [5320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5320.39s)

step people are gonna have gi issues if they're overeating or if they're eating too fast or if they're not chewing well eating too fast and not chewing well go together and especially if people are on the run or they're eating while they're distracted and the the mechanical part of digestion the actual chewing investigation is really critical for the chemical part of digestion to come later [5346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5346.87s)

because the acid and the enzymes are not designed to break down large chunks of food right they're designed to take already tiny particles with a lot of surface area and break them down further so eating in a slower calm environment healthier foods the right amount of them chewing that's all a pretty big deal to what's going in your gi tract drinking enough water is actually quite important [5374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5374.0s)

so your gi tract can flush and peristalsis is stimulated by water so specifically drinking a lot of water first thing in morning like half a liter to a liter first thing in the morning and then waiting til that leaves your stomach before having breakfast something like a half hour very helpful for a lot of people and then taking the right pro and [5395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5395.57s)

prebiotics can be very helpful and the prebiotics are foods that are gonna feed the healthy bacteria in the gut and there's a lot of prebiotics that people can get into but just even starting simply with things like resistance starch just tight you know these are kinds of fiber that helped feed good bacteria differentially more than bacteria that cause problems so a [5425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5425.86s)

prebiotic supplement taking it at night in particular it's usually quite helpful and you can take it with a probiotic and probiotics are tricky this is also one that you can personalize you can do an test at home for your microbiome with companies like biome or you biome and see how your microbiome is doing and start to personalize it you can do deeper tests with integrative doctors [5448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5448.94s)

which be super useful so i won't get into specific brands of probiotics but there there are ones that can be quite meaningful yeah there's a kind of taking a lot of mental notes there and took a swig of water whilst you were talking as well has a lot of things to think about and it's i guess something to emphasize people listening that it's not just i think a lot of nootropics are sort of in [5478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5478.88s)

terms of being for the mind and yet it's really this connection this intimate relationship between the mind and the body and more and more it seems that mental health issues such as depression can be caused or exacerbated by the things that are happening in the microbiome and in the physical body i guess we know at the superficial level if you go and do some exercise you [5504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5504.11s)

probably feel better mentally and emotionally but when we talk about diets and so on i think not everyone is making the the connection that there is a can in between these things okay right before we have done i was talking to a friend who's just starting her first business and she was asking me if i would tell her just exactly what to do a checklist for how to sort of business [5529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5529.04s)

and i said this is not the mindset there's not the appropriate mindset to sort of business is that's the appropriate mindset to be an employee which you've always been which is will someone else tell me what to do and all and i'll just do it right which is a mindset that our parents and school and religion trained us well to do but if you're gonna run your own business then [5550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5550.16s)

you actually have to figure out what the  to do you have to figure out what is relevant what's needed does it make sense and ultimately you're responsible for what if your business fails because of something your employees did it's still your business that failed you're still the one that hired those employees that train them and manage them that you know [5569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5569.24s)

whatever it was and so and if your business succeeds it's ultimately yours right so the that the responsibility well even more so when it comes to your own health and when you if you coming back to the beginning when you we're talking about empowered responsibilities in health every single experience that we are going to have in this life is going to be mediated through our body [5599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5599.84s)

every experience of learning and helping people and making love and staring a sunset and you know every everything what we're going to do is going to be mediated through our physiology and how long it lasts and how vital it is and how cognitively clear we are how emotionally clear we are is it is all related to the bio hardware that our consciousness is running on and so [5633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5633.86s)

you're born here you got this body you didn't happen to have an education manual given to you for how to really use it well but you should figure it out like of all the things that everyone should become an expert in learning how to take care of the vessel that they exist in that mediates everything else they do should be one of the things that [5657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5657.469s)

everybody develops some capacity in yeah i guess because we all have one we take it so for granted that we forget that it's it's the thing that's so important than ever present that it's easy to overlook as you say we people get rid of houses and get new ones they get rid of cars and get new ones you cannot live with your body no yet you have to take care of it yes you say that brings us [5681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5681.139s)

around full circle to responsibility and i want to be respectful of your time i feel like i would happily sit through your sleep cycle way for you to wake up and keep talking and just go round and round and round but we can wrap things up on four for this particular occasion d there's just one more question we didn't ask you last time but we like to ask the guest and i think in the context [5706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5706.369s)

of this conversation i think there should be if it's very fitting and that is what does living a high existence mean to you hmm well there's obviously lots of really fun ways to answer that oh share one answer that's related to something we talked about today which was you were asking the question of can we enhance certain capabilities without [5736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5736.34s)

detracting from other ones can we increase our ability to focus on a task and do task switching simultaneously we're we're used to doing a lot of theory of trade-offs in our life where at all scales what's good for one country is bad for another country in terms of war particular trade agreement or whatever what's good for one company is bad for another company that's [5771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5771.23s)

competing in space what's good what seems like it's good for us today is actually bad tomorrow in terms of the chocolate cake scenarios that we were talking about or the the smart drug we're using that seems good for one aspect of life is actually damaging other aspects of life the the proposal that we're voting on is it leads to so much political [5794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5794.8s)

polarization is because it benefits some things and damages others and so people who care about one side cluster here those a cluster there as much as we can get over [[decision making]] based on unnecessary dichotomy is an unnecessary theory of trade-offs and say how can we factor everything that is connected to it all the things that are interconnected to a particular decision [5820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5820.52s)

that are meaningful and enhance them all simultaneously right enhance across dialectics simultaneously so is there a way to help the economy make jobs and make the environment better rather than jobs or the environment well there are and if you require that you find something that does both life is gonna be radically better can we find something that helps task switching and [5845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5845.42s)

focus yes and now that starts to extend to everything can i live my life in a way that is actually enjoyable now and that leads to a progressively more enjoyable future yes can i figure out how to increase my gratitude what is while simultaneously increasing my motivation to make things better yes so all of the dichotomies where we will typically enhance one [5874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5874.31s)

thing at the cost of something else meaningful you know we could say a high existence is being high in any particular area but most of the things that people would try to make higher they would try to optimize would be at the expense of something else in the in the tree that previous way of thinking about it so high across all domains simultaneously because we're thinking [5900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5900.13s)

about the interconnectedness of all of it and supporting the entire picture or consciously is that one meaningful way to think about hi existence yeah i think that's the most healthy way in which to try and approach it that we live in so many times we seem to think we're we're living in a world of zero-sum games but what i like the what you're emphasizing [5927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5927.469s)

which is that if we begin from the premise of how can we find the best thing that includes all of these elements rather than thinking i just want to go down one particular rabbit hole thank you thank you for that and thank you for coming on the show again and sharing a lot of very deep knowledge that certainly got me thinking that i need to go and pursue some elimination [5949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNG-gGxroY&t=5949.25s)
