foreign music music all right we are going to begin music everybody so firstly thank you so much for being here thank you for being here to celebrate endings and beginnings which i'll talk about in a little moment thank you everyone online who's tuning in from [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=31.14s)

all around the world um and yeah i just want to uh explain firstly why is only half of rebel wisdom here so david has been um really struggling with his health recently um and is very burned out and so we were trying to find a way that he could attend today and and make it not not too overwhelming but it was just a bit too much so today david is very much here in [58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=58.02s)

spirit and i really want to bring him into the room but he's not going to be physically here he's he's just um not really well enough to do so so of course it's very emotional for me i would really love him to be here but i completely of course understand um if you're not doing well and it's just too much it's just the way it is so um yeah i thought maybe we could we [77](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=77.64s)

could send him a lot of love just to start with um uh yeah applause music so what we will be doing is um jonathan rousen from perspective will come up in a moment talk a little bit about what we'll talk a little bit about what we're [112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=112.5s)

both doing next and and jonathan will talk a little bit about what david's doing next um because we both have um in a way like i said this is a day of of endings but it's also a day of beginnings and i think both what what david and i are doing next is very much in the spirit of rebel wisdom and it's going to be happening within a kind of wider network that i don't maybe we can [131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=131.16s)

figure out today what we call the the corner of the internet and the kind of line of inquiry that that so many of us are interested in some people call it the the [[sensemaking]] web uh the meta web i don't know i sped that up but there's um you know there's very much um yeah our intention is very much that we're we're rebel wisdom ends because you know what we were set up when we set up in in [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=156.06s)

2018 it was um it wasn't that long ago in registered but a lot has happened and as we know it was brexit and trump and it was this sort of post-truth thank you yes the realities of a post-truth world and what david and i really connected around was this feeling of what isn't being expressed in the culture and the fact [181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=181.14s)

that what isn't being expressed is is driving so much of the polarization and driving so much of our inability to have conversations um and so that that at the time really felt uh super alive and i think i still i still think it's incredibly relevant um and then as time went on obviously the world changed and the sort of um being the rebels in a way feels less [204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=204.18s)

important than finding a new synthesis moving forward um and for both me and david we both have visions of what that synthesis looks like which are which are somewhat divergent but also similar in some ways as well so um we'll talk about that in a moment and and jonathan will give a little bit more context just about today so um today is a very participatory day uh and it's really about you guys it's about rebel wisdom it's a really oh there we go you you know we created a platform and a container and and perhaps a particular um ethos i suppose we could call it a way of coming together a way of bringing together sort of personal growth practices with cultural conversations [251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=251.519s)

um but it was really everyone who watched everyone who engaged everyone who did our courses everyone who filled the container that was magical and that's why it's actually very touching it's just touching to be sort of sandwiched between um people in the room and people uh online because also like during covid especially we had an incredible [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=273.96s)

community um of online um you know we're doing like three things a week at times and then there's a new community that sprang out of that called emerging commons which adriana and nick will be talking about later on as we as we knew the end of the day looking to the kind of what's pollen dating right what's emerging from from [292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=292.68s)

one thing ending and something in the beginning um and then practically you have a schedule right after this introduction um and jonathan comes up uh john verakee will very kindly leave us through a contemplation practice um just kind of get us contemplative um and get us dropped in a little bit then we're going to move into breakouts [313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=313.56s)

which i'll explain the logistics of that um in a little bit but we have the whole venue so we use the whole space except for the study which is our sort of storage room and kind of um green room so uh but that'll all be made clear um i just we have a really great team of volunteers who might stand up if you can yeah so we got eileen in the back hey i think eileen's the only volunteer in [343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=343.56s)

the room right now so hey eileen um so then we have marta who who you is marta marta hey applause samarta has been an amazing part of the team for probably six six months eight months maybe longer yeah so bart is sort of coordinating the volunteers uh and we have a few more people coming so if if [365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=365.28s)

someone has a name badge on they're basically just going to be mainly what the volunteers are doing and just helping us move through the space and fill the breakout rooms etc so i kind of look out for the name badges um yes and then before i invite jonathan up i also just wanted to share my intention for today and what i've really been feeling over the last [384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=384.419s)

six months or so um which is around endings and around the end of rebel wisdom which is a real desire to simultaneously hold two things at once without completely collapsing into one of them or the other which really speaks to so much of what we've been trying to do with rebel wisdom so holding it at one time ending and and the finality of [407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=407.639s)

ending and really being with that and with just as much heart and passion holding new beginnings so that we're not holding one or the other but that we're actually holding both of them really fully with all of ourselves throughout today and that's really what i've been trying to do um yeah over the last uh over the last six or eight months or so [431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=431.22s)

um so yeah i'm gonna invite uh jonathan up just to talk about what's what's happening more broadly as rebel wisdom ends thank you sir thank you okay i'll i'll sit down um thank you so much ali and uh i only discovered i'll be speaking this morning uh early late afternoon yesterday [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=454.259s)

um and then what i have to say is delicate um and important so bear with me as i think it through as i speak there's a bit closer yeah um i speak here with uh three hats on in a sense only one scarf of course but three hats um and those hats are personal they're [476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=476.4s)

just me as someone who's enjoyed rebel wisdom they're my professionals director of perspectiva and there's also my kind of community head of representing what ali was alluding to earlier this uh elusive community that's sprung up so let me take them in turn on a personal level i speak as one of all of you as someone who has loved rebel wisdom [497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=497.88s)

who has been on their show a few times i was um invited on by david to speak to um peter peter jordan peterson itis peterson itis peterson of course was a big part of the early story of rebel wisdom and laterally you know more a more interesting uh channel you know contested part perhaps [520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=520.26s)

and that was in the woods in a very memorable conversation with david i've also had a lovely conversation with john graviki whom you'll see later today which was memorable in its own way too and i was asked to speak to um my love of robert persig in the in the book club and all of those things were very precious to me personally um but beyond that i'm like all of you [539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=539.519s)

i'm the guy listening to any one of the great figures they've had on the show while i'm doing the dishes while i'm doing the shopping while i'm taking the kids to school sometimes with one one headphone on and one off so i can hear the kid but i'm still like what's daniel smackdriver just said or whatever so i'm one of i'm i i'm with rebels on [560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=560.1s)

that sense and on that sense i want to just begin by saying something keeping very much david's presence in mind great tragedy that can't be here today but i also saw him yesterday and i have his permission analysis to speak to this but not just their permission i want all of us to just say fabulously well done you guys have done something extraordinary [581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=581.58s)

applause and 20 2018 when it began um i actually met david first of all in 2015 for those who remember there was an alter ego gathering in 2015 where i first met david and already there he was kind of thinking things through and then there was a gestation with ali that gave birth to rebel wisdom um 2018 is very different from 2022 it's [615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=615.18s)

a very different world we've gone through something but rebel wisdom has taken us through that time there's a sense in which the [[sensemaking]] process was carried carried a community and also built one at the same time it met a need of the moment the need of today is somewhat different but it remains true that the interiority [636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=636.24s)

of human beings the ultimate nature meaning and purpose of life the attempt to get beyond facile problem solving to make sense in a broader further deeper way to bring your full self to your life remains an imperative a cultural imperative a civilizational survival imperative so rebel wisdom has performed an [659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=659.7s)

enormous service to the community and i say that they share that as with my personal hat on um because when i come to the next hat i just want you to know that you know i bring with it a love of what has been done and the respect for it and admiration at times even an end read i'm fully honest because they just did so very well so quickly they were really [677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=677.64s)

like a meteorite shining in the sky and just did one amazing thing after the other so now here we are in 2022 and um they've taken the difficult decision difficult resolute admirable decision to end to feel the need to end and to a close it's one of the toughest things in life in any capacity just at a personal level um it's another kind of another hat i used to play chess professionally and one of the hardest things i ever did was just let it go i don't think i'll ever be as good at anything else and the room reminds me of that actually a little bit with the black and white but um but i i am i i really admire that capacity to know when to say goodbye but even when you [718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=718.98s)

find the courage for that there is a deeper challenge of the skill of how to end not just to end which it requires resolve and courage and tenacity but then i kind of discernment and patience and um consideration and sensitivity to the new moment and to the people still involved so the question for those who [741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=741.72s)

love rebel wisdom is what becomes of what has ended the ending has happened i see that knowing that in a sense for people attending here today this is actually the beginning of the end in a sense because you have a whole day of delicious full activity ahead so we're not quite there but um i speak on behalf of ali called it the matter where briefly it's been called the liminal web the sense-making web personally i'm going to make a picture um i found that the word that is most encompassing for me and works that brings all of the griffin groups in which includes quite a [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=783.36s)

diverse bunch of people right who don't always agree politically often have different spiritual outlooks different sensibilities different senses of what we should talk about i feel i like i now call that group the the post-conventional world or the post-conventional community it's just a way of saying people who are beyond in some language beyond gaming in some [801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=801.54s)

language seeking a new kind of wisdom some language trying to make sense but it's beyond convention it's beyond what has come before it's an attempt to build a new world and that's where we are and many people now are beginning new initiatives as a result of the inspiration of rebel wisdom often inspired to create new communities new institutions which were [821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=821.22s)

needed now with that in mind i come to my other hat which is director of perspectiva prospectiva is a charity we're a not-for-profit organization that's quite important to stress because rebel wisdom was a company a for-profit and successful commercial entity that could have carried on had they wanted to [843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=843.12s)

doing courses and you know building memberships and carrying on in that regard what was always clear however was in addition to that it was a community asset it's also an educational asset and a philosophical resource so the question is as the entity ends what becomes of the educational and cultural resources that remain available from rebel wisdom [865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=865.5s)

ali mentioned it's very important to both end and allow for new beginnings so it's important to understand there is no question of rebranding there's no question of just a fresh look of paint as they say or a new name it's not as simple as that something has to end there really is a time to close something to be with that ending to process it [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=886.74s)

before anything else can arise and i say that also mindful of avid and where he is at the moment and how he is that time is needed to allow something to end to process that to recover renew and then listen for the wellsprings of renewal but while you're doing that something has been created that still is still extant it's still there [910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=910.38s)

there is a about a quarter of a million youtube subscribers for one thing there's a large newsletter um community that is still waiting for information and content so the story now happens as a kind of birth really because ali has a very exciting near future ahead with a new book coming out and new ventures of various kinds [934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=934.199s)

and you know he will take that path and i believe the bigger picture is one of the main names for it and um meanwhile it's not quite clear what will happen on the other side in terms of the substance and name because we don't want to rush that but what i can tell you in its form and it's sort of morphology is that what's [952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=952.44s)

going to happen next is we're going to create make of the prior rebel wisdom a community asset something that is shared by this post-conventional world if you want to call it something else you're welcome by the way and we can talk about that later we might even make that part of the design challenge um it's going to be available so that um people who are doing similar work still have that chance to broadcast their work still have a chance to reach the wider world um and those who are already interested in rebel wisdom and have come forever wisdom still recognize discernably that this is part of the same journey but it will [993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=993.06s)

have a new name and a new emphasis that's more suitable for 2022. and beyond ali mentioned synthesis there will be aspects of that there will also be aspects of what is the nature of the new world forming who is actually helping to build new possibilities from the learnings of the post-conventional world what is it like to have new capacities [1013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1013.94s)

for wisdom at scale into culturally institutionally how do they feed into institutional forms what becomes of people who change their life and build new communities what kind of world is that what do we know of it so we will be looking for patterns of renewal that are informed by the the new wisdom that's been brought into being through rebel wisdom and we don't know [1037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1037.04s)

what we're going to call it yet and we don't even want we do have some backroom chat about what we might call it but i'd rather keep that away until we give time for the dust to settle um perspective will manage that um a curious thing you don't know what's going to happen to your career i i was a few you know six years ago i was [1057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1057.679s)

traveling around the world playing chess give or take and then i one thing led to another i got a job and then through that job i wrote about [[climate change]] and spirituality i realized it was kind of the same question fundamentally and i later met thomas who was resting with similar things we ended up creating a centitical perspectiva and at that [1076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1076.28s)

time it was meant to be a kind of research institute it was designed to be a thought leadership vehicle writing books and articles but what actually happened was um we found this wider network was springing up around us including rubber wisdom which are kind of siblings in a sense and the reason that matters is that we changed we morphed into something we've now got a publishing arm we have this emerge network that we're in charge of there's this realization festival that's another kind of partnership and so the sort of the evolution of things has meant that we've become this incubator of sorts i sometimes even think of ourselves as foster parents there's a [1116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1116.66s)

kind of like looking after things that that are not entirely ours but responsibility towards and that's why when this situation arose of how to end well it suddenly occurred to me to offer them look we can do this you want to make a community asset we know how to do that we know the people we we share some of your underlying philosophical vision [1136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1136.64s)

so that's what we're going to do um it will take a bit of time um it will work david will play a leading role in it we very much you know i want you to know that we have those best interests very much at our heart and it won't work without that actually at some level it it we're we're very keen that that's a part of it but we're going to bring in other people and [1157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1157.52s)

we're new as well so um i'll end with a church full churchill lane just to uh increase the energy before you leave there's a famous wartime moment where churchill speaks of uh endings and beginnings um attempted to do a churchill impersonation but i won't risk it um he says um [1179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1179.059s)

this is not the beginning this is not the end this is not the beginning of the end but it is the end of the begin the end of the might be the end of the beginning now the end of the beginning for you today um because um sorry excuse me the beginning of the end [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1198.5s)

for you today the end of the beginning for the network that was my point so in other words you're about to start something and this is the end of the beginning session but the wider community uh sorry kind of confused okay applause one more time one more time okay [1218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1218.48s)

okay it's the end of the beginning of this session today and that was my point but it's the beginning of the end no it's not a rewind right i'm not going to try again you know exactly what i mean the the community aspect of this is that while it's the end of the beginning of this session right [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1246.14s)

no it's not applause oh thank you thank you jonathan thank you really awesome if it makes you feel any better at a workshop i was leading last weekend i tried to deliver ian mcgilker's line that it's neither either or or bothan but either or and both and but i was like same thing same thing happened it was incredibly difficult but [1278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1278.12s)

yeah thank you and and so um yeah i think jonathan laid it out really nicely we'll be doing an announcement to to the to uh the mailing list around this exactly what's what's happening what people can expect as well i'm going to continue using and uh writing on the sub stack um that's currently the rebel wisdom stub sack but we'll we'll become the [1296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1296.96s)

bigger picture which is um both the name of my book but also um what i'm interested in and i think what what many of us are interested in is really understanding how do we make sense of the bigger picture of what's going on um and yeah but we'll we'll get into that um we'll have more information on that i really i'm quite conscious and [1316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1316.1s)

keen for today as as well as being what we're doing next to be really honoring rebel wisdom and and um yeah bringing it to an end and seeing what pollinates as well um i also wanted to uh mention a name that jonathan mentioned thomas thomas bjorkman um thomas gave us our uh early funding rebel wisdom and change our lives in the [1337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1337.64s)

process so thomas i want to say thank you applause and um much of that network that donna was talking about rebel wisdom you know that's why we have often referred to to perspective or emerges sister networks without explaining why sometimes we just did that that's why because um thomas and jonathan and others have [1366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1366.62s)

really built a really amazing network of this kind of liminal web whatever you want to call it so um great okay so we're going to uh now go into breakouts okay let's get started so please find your seats end your no doubt very interesting conversations [1392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1392.12s)

right okay so we're going to um john rivecki is going to come up and come up in a minute can you hear him is this microphone okay yeah it's fine john john is going to come up in a moment um and after that aisha can be as well before lunch after lunch we have open space for different practices which i'll [1420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1420.86s)

talk about before lunch i also just wanted to because we've started the day and we're about to go into the content i just wanted to also um leave maybe have maybe a minute to just be with um well be with david in some sense and just kind of bring him into the room and just allow the feelings of of him not being here to just be kind of there and [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1443.419s)

process a little bit i don't want to overrun it as well i also know that he is very keen that it doesn't sort of um dominate the day and that we still have that aliveness and we still have that um space but i think i think in order to do that just just maybe just a few moments that we just sit with that so that we can be with it and then and keep i am going to stand up firstly i'm [1475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1475.6s)

excited about what we have coming up all day but especially uh about what we have coming up right now and so john viveki i have to say john has probably been the most influential person on my thinking that we've um had on rebel wisdom in so many ways i've had the great pleasure and feel incredibly lucky actually to have spent i think 64 sessions overall doing [[sensemaking]] 101 eight of them with john um and really and of course reading his work and watching his work on youtube um yeah has really been instrumental for for both me and david and and the product as a whole and we wanted to start with john because the concept of the meaning crisis and john's thought is very wide-ranging and also uh transcends it [1530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1530.36s)

includes the meaning crisis i think but i wanted to start with the meaning crisis because this has been something that we looked at in depth at rebel wisdom and really felt very strongly throughout was that what some people have called the god-shaped hole in society which i think the meaning crisis is more than that but this sense of a lack of purpose [1550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1550.46s)

direction and meaning and culture feels absolutely crucial and it feels really difficult to talk about what's going on in the world and to talk about the symptoms we're seeing without getting an understanding of that underlying concept so we wanted to start the day with john and i'd like to invite you up john and please give him a huge round of applause so what side do you want me on i should [1575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1575.6s)

i'll be here that's why it doesn't be in the projectors you're blocking out the um yeah is that okay okay for you guys you can see us yeah right so and by the way we're a little bit behind schedule so what we're going to do is shorten the break sorry laughter um we'll have a we'll have a comfort break but then i.e chat will come on so we'll have maybe kind of a five minute period where we need to use the bathroom we do but we're just going to go through so john firstly thank you for being here i'm really glad to be here i really wanted to be here [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1620.059s)

and okay so i'm sorry about this question but i had the real sense of wanting to ask you um you released awakening from the meaning crisis a couple of years ago all right 2009 2019 do you feel we are awakening from the meaning crisis so i was at a conference called the consciousness and conscience conference and of all places thunder bay ontario we had a lot of people there and this will actually address your question um and everybody was talking about a sense of momentum that these things are happening there's a sense of convergence post-conventional convergence um and something's emerging and so i'd probably speaking out of some selection bias because let people more and more want to talk to me about this issue but all the people i were talking to about how this is stirring up in their lives in their communities and people [1691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1691.22s)

are addressing it so i think there is definitely something that's taking shape even taking on a life of its own and gaining momentum i don't know about how well it is doing with respect to all of the deleterious forces that are also accelerating um so the answer is you're gonna hate this [1714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1714.5s)

maybe because there's it's not just an idea like there's emerging communities of practice emerging and where we had a meeting in vermont of many of the leaders of these emerging communities and we're federating together we're producing a meta curriculum on how to design in the college of practices a vetting [1737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1737.36s)

process so that we prevent each other from becoming gurus or anything strange like that um all of that's happening um but again also the way things are the medical crisis and the deleterious impact on people's lives that's all those forces are also accelerating so that's how it seems to me right now and probably um most of us will have some kind of sense of the what the meaning crisis is but it might actually be good to define it especially if anyone is um kind of a little bit new to it but yeah i mean and has your conception of it changed since since you began this kind of journey around it okay so i'm going to give an answer and it'll take about 50 hours [1779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1779.6s)

um so the way i usually try to talk about it is and i've done this many of you might have heard this before and i apologize because it's come up in the courses but there's some core themes um one is the the very dynamic and self-organizing processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us [1806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1806.0s)

perennially susceptible to self-deceptive self-destructive behavior both individually and collectively what i can say about change on that dimension is not just my own but in collaboration with other people the scientific thinking about that has become more precise just recently published a paper um like just a month ago [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1829.46s)

um in the journal of phenomenology and cognitive sciences integrating the relevance realization framework with the other big framework the predictive processing framework and this is a big thing scientifically so what i can say is if people are interested in more the scientific nuts and bolts there's been i think a considerable step forward there i i that may be [1851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1851.12s)

the most important scientific paper i publish in my career we'll see i mean i might get hit by bus tomorrow but it's i think it's very important so the idea is but for us the idea is these processes are so powerful and so complex but and at the same time that means in in ways that are sort of ungraspable from our egocentric [1878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1878.24s)

awareness we we are susceptible to very powerful and self-organizing patterns of self-deception and self-destructive behavior and so we need ecologies of practices to intervene on that in order to reduce it now that adaptivity isn't it isn't called computational calculation it's in the exercise it was the contact [1906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1906.14s)

whenever you're touching you're being touched it's the contact and i'm caring about this rather than that that that adaptivity is that that caring contact and that sense of caring connectedness is what makes your life meaningful to you the more you feel regularly and reliably caring connectedness to yourself to [1930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1930.74s)

other people and to the world and you just did it with the world that's why it matters the more you feel that your life is worth the inevitable frustrations and pain to be a human being so you need practices that not only ameliorate the self-destruction the self-deception which hampers and undermines that caring connectedness [1956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1956.24s)

es that cultivate it curate it and create it where it's missing to develop it and you need those two to be integrated together because they are that's wisdom that's wisdom so wisdom i used to say put on my tombstone neither nostalgia nor utopia [1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=1982.52s)

but if you can put one more thing it's going to get big i guess one more thing wisdom is not optional wisdom is not optional and if you don't care about it you are in you are fettered fettered to processes of self-disception self-destruction individually and collectively that steal your life away [2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2004.24s)

from you and if you don't you think you can ignore this that is itself a supreme act of self-deception wisdom is not optional so cross time across history and culture context people have come up with these ecologies of practices this is why rebel wisdom has emerged [2027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2027.58s)

but here's the thing these ecologies of practices for the cultivation of wisdom the hence the meaning in life they can't just happen beliefs our culture is so obsessed with beliefs it has to happen at all the levels of virtue all the levels of knowing you have to get the right skills you have to be able to take the right [2050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2050.44s)

perspectives you have to be able to cultivate your character you have to be able to generate that living connection communitas this turner called it a place that used to do that at all those levels of the psyche all those corresponding levels of the world individually and collectively was religion that's what religions did they did a lot of other things but i would argue and i've argued it what made them survive was this powerful adaptive function now for many of us the legacy religions religions that were born in the axial revolution are no longer viable for us for a whole host of reasons i won't review [2094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2094.599s)

but what's undeniable it wrote the fastest growing demographic group and it will soon be the largest in all western societies are the nuns n-o-n-e-s they do not belong to any official religion but they are not sort of village atheists most of them describe themselves with this nebulous unhelpful but somewhat [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2116.859s)

comforting phrase of spiritual but not religious which means like think about this spiritual so you believe in spirits oh no okay they describe their spirituality's primary one of seeking the meaning crisis is people are seeking but they're not finding they don't know where to go to cultivate wisdom i do this regularly with my students i'll say where do you go for information they hold up their phones immediately because they're all cyborgs absolutely where do you go for knowledge and they're sort of influenced by [2164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2164.02s)

post-modernism so they they hum and hall a little bit but they're in the university and they're taking a class with me so they say science that's a problem too but we'll talk about that another time and then i say where do you go for wisdom you get a stoning dangerous silence [2186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2186.099s)

remember wisdom isn't optional the meaning crisis is wisdom isn't optional the traditions we had where we went to home the ecologies of the practices for the cultivation of wisdom and the enhancement of meaning are no longer and we'd have to take this seriously or no longer viable options for people they're seeking but the world is not i mean western culture whatever western means sort of post-european post-christian world pretty is not disposed to help them with that and so they do it auto didactically some of that can succeed and autodidactic is better than nothing but only a little bit there's a problem with autodidactic is it tends to reinforce [2235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2235.359s)

the biases the egocentrism the tendencies towards narcissism etc that we're trying to ameliorate with our wisdom practices so we have a growing problem in the western world and it's now entered the dsm as an official sort of problem of spiritual bypassing which is people are doing sort of they want they're they're treating spirituality as [2259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2259.06s)

a commodity that you acquire in order to feel better why it's called spiritual bypassing is there they're pursuing spirituality but they're bypassing their moral epistemic cultural and aesthetic obligations that's the meaning crisis thank you brilliant really brilliant um this this really touches on something that i've i've wrestled with a lot which [2290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2290.859s)

is if we don't remember where to go for wisdom and our traditional say axial age christian religions christianity perhaps buddhism lots of other religions world religions are not you know we see declining attendance they're just not um perhaps fit for purpose right now leaves us in quite a quandary because it's really difficult to start a new [2312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2312.52s)

religion and most of them please don't try um most of them don't work i i researched this a lot from my book and especially the nuns and and that that rise and especially in the context of psychedelics i was thinking well there are new psychedelic religions forming and they're you know they they're quiet and problematic a lot of them at the [2335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2335.079s)

same time one of the most successful is santo daimi which combines christianity with the with ayahuasca with the practice so i guess my question is and i think it applies to all of us because it applies to these communities of practice that we're all part of on the one hand it might be that you know like early christianity you've spoken to this before these communities of practice [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2357.52s)

are resilient enough to thrive and expand and become something that has mainstream penetration which has always been a hope of mine at the same time i don't know whether that is how to do that certainly but also could a revival of existing religions be an option as well that's what i'm curious about which maybe there's a third option or many more yeah first of all don't start your own religion so if you remember anything from today don't start your own religion um i i want to say this explicitly one more time i'm not trying to do that okay i'm trying to i'm trying to discern where it might be happening and see how i can most wisely commit myself to helping it give birth that's my project if you don't mind the being irreligious because i don't mean to be a religious i'm not jesus i'm john the baptist i want to find what's coming and and point it out and it helps that he was called john so on that point [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2430.96s)

um one point on the psychedelics and i mentioned this to ali i just released an essay on uh the institute for art and ideas about psychedelics and getting closer to reality and i tried to make a distinction and this is partly towards the answer the reason why psychedelics are important right now is because so for example i was just in prague progress i think we've been voted the [2455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2455.14s)

most atheist country in uh europe they're not happy about that designation by the way it's not like me but um but they're really struggling with psychedelics because they're taking off because remember i said something wisdom is not optional people will pursue not even people as soon as you get in highly intelligent social beings they they pursue altered [2477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2477.339s)

states of consciousness because transcendence is an integral way in which you become wiser so caledonian crows will tumble down rooftops so they get dizzy the caledonian crows are really smart right and elephants will eat fruit that's fermenting so they get stoned which is dangerous so it's worth it to them okay so the transcendence matters [2499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2499.9s)

but the thing is the thing about psychedelics is the old thing timothy leary you need the set and the setting but i would add a third s you need the sacredness it has to be put in a context properly integrates that transcendence into multiple multiple domains of your life see what religions used to do [2520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2520.9s)

is um so for example you can get into the flow state while playing a video game but for many people that doesn't transfer outside to their their life in fact you can get video game addiction which is you're flowing in the game but you're you're getting anti-flow in your life anti-flow is depression by the way [2539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2539.619s)

flowing depressioner i think correlated right and so you're depressed there you're flowing here so you get more and what you're trying to spend more and more time inside the video again right when i was doing touch each one i've been doing it for about four years and i was in graduate school in time long long [2556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2556.3s)

ago right um and people were coming up to me and saying what's up with you you're now much more balanced your arguments much more flowing you're much and it's like oh my gosh i didn't notice it but what was happening in the ritual and that's the proper way of talking about it because this is what a ritual does it sets things up so it transfers to many [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2578.859s)

domains of your life that percolates from two different levels of your psyche this is what we have to offer people if we want to answer your question but how do we get it going how do we set up the proper framing the ritual framing and the philosophical framing because that's what taoism did that's what buddhism did that's what christianity [2602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2602.98s)

did such that when people are undergoing the transformative experience it regularly and reliably transfers broadly and deeply into their life plea and transformatively into their psyche when we put that context around transformative context that's how we can i think start to generate the religion that's not a [2627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2627.76s)

religion without anybody trying to found a religion and in connection with that i think we have to listen to han the next buddha is the sangha stop looking for the individual the thing that's going to act like socrates or siddhartha to us is rituals [2649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2649.66s)

that activate the [[collective intelligence]] of distributed cognition so that we transformatively experience it in a way that transfers broadly in our life and deeply in our psyche that's what we need to do so in in addition to any ecology of practices we need a meta-diological practice that is doing that so that we have the sage to guide us without investing that dangerous power in any particular personality that's my proposal i'm in um no brilliant thank you thank you so i really want to open up the q a in a moment because the the value of being all here together is that we we have that and that it includes online as well but i thought maybe [2704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2704.5s)

we could just close this this opening with with just continuing on that track i'm i'm curious where to do that right to start doing that to start coming together in that way where we are focusing on our [[collective intelligence]] and on the sangha what capacities do we need as individuals and or as a groups i i think we need the capacities that [2727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2727.48s)

are being practiced in an ecology practices um maybe to find out as well okay so first of all the the point is you are you're at your adaptivity relies on what's called a point of processing let me just give you a couple of quick examples that you're experiencing right now so it's not like what's done talking about you always use this disease [2753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2753.52s)

multiple syllabic words what's wrong with him i get it i'm trying to get better at it so you have to constantly calibrate your level of arousal i don't mean sexual arousal hopefully that's not being activated right now right i mean your metabolic arousal and so there's no there's what what you have is you have your peripheral [[nervous system]] your autonomic listen to that word that means self-law self-organizing self-governing there's no boss there's there's two systems the parasympathetic system and the sympathetic system and they work and it works in this way the sympathetic system [2795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2795.04s)

is biased to try and interpret much of the world as it can as an a threat or an opportunity and therefore to raise your level of arousal it's biased your parasympathetic system is biased the other way it's biased to try and interpreting as much of the world as safe so that you [2816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2816.819s)

can rest recuperate and then they're not separate from each other they're constantly pulling on each other trying to correct each other the biases continually play off against each other so that you are constantly evolving your level of arousal because that's not good right [2845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2845.8s)

okay so i'll talk to you that's not good and being canadian i'll just be middle all the time that's not good either okay it constantly has to evolve it does so in a self-organizing self-governing manner that's a point of processing your attention is doing it right now if you think about arousal and attention and how much they matter to [[sensemaking]] you have two networks when you have three but i'm just going to talk about two right now you have one the task focus network and it's trying to keep you focused on the task hopefully paying attention to john vernicki right now you have the default mode network that is trying to get let your mind wander and music you know how much you spend doing that every day you ever wondered why you wonder adopted these two processes are an opponent process so you focus then your mind wanders and creates all kinds of possibilities of what you could pay attention to you kill most of them off it's like evolution you feel most of those variations off and you bring a couple in put it into the task focused and you focus again variation selection variation selection that's how you evolve your attention it's constantly evolving that's a point of process does that make sense okay those are just two easily [2934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2934.3s)

accessible examples of something that is multi-scale throughout all of your biology and your cognition that's what i mean about how dynamically self-organizing it is there is no panacea practice because you work through opponent processing well meditation met remember what i said is this enough it's all if that's all you do it's [2961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2961.66s)

better than nothing you know it's what about if i just never take my glasses off and look into the world deeply then i don't know if i'm looking through rose-colored glasses what do i need to do i need to do opponent processing i need to cycle between them continuously a meditative practice and a contemplative practice i have to break [2978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2978.16s)

out of inappropriate frames and explore for new frames that i don't yet know and they have to i have to do that same thing with should i do just a seated product you should do seated practice and a movement practice you should do practices that shut off the inferential mind to enhance insight those are mindfulness practices and you [2999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=2999.04s)

should do practices that do the opposite oh no i don't want to shut off my inside processing that's the sure path to glory when you like it you call it insight when you don't like that process you call it jumping to a conclusion it's the same process it's the same process by intuition when your intuition is working you like it [3027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3027.0s)

when you don't like it you call it bias or racism there's no panacea process stop looking for the divine faculty you don't have one stop demonizing any of your faculties they're all there for an adaptive reason so you need [[complex system|complex systems]] of practices that are in complementary relationships opponent processing relationships to get [3053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3053.88s)

the most dynamically self-organizing process to best fit your dynamically self-organizing cognition that runs on multi-layered opponent processing that's why you need an ecology of practices absolutely yeah amazing thank you thanks john so i would like to have some time for q a [3079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3079.74s)

hi john thank you very much i wanted to say that the work crisis is very negative yes and i feel like when we look or history looks back in a hundred years there will be some kind of name for this period some ism and i feel like we should just go ahead and create that name and make it [3105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3105.54s)

positive and not keep talking about this negative crisis sure and i would like to ask you uh to try to do this maybe not on stage right now but well i i i'm hoping again repeating the shameless plug after socrates is not negative it's constructive it's creative it's right and i'm actually talking with people about what is it that's being [3134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3134.94s)

positively proposed uh that and i don't have a name we're doing kind of the same thing that ali's doing we're banding names around right now but i do think something is going to come out of it um that's all i can say right now okay john we have a question from online [3157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3157.74s)

and this comes from uh burton anderson if we have an ecology of practices to develop insight that is saying the glasses the framing meditation contemplation the four p's that is positioned propositional procedural or spectival and participatory are we not leaving out the heart where in all of this does the heart come [3180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3180.96s)

in being a giver taking care cultivating love it seems to me that sometimes the west misses this key piece from the east is that not the case it's not where is it addressed uh great questions so first of all i want to remind uh what i said a few minutes ago relevance realization is not called calculation it's caring [3205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3205.5s)

it's caring it's caring about this information rather than that and the reason why you care about computers don't care about the information they're processing they don't you do you care about the information you're processing because you are constantly moment by moment taking care of yourself [3225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3225.42s)

you are self-making thing auto poetic right so affect arousal and attention are intrinsically part of your attention of your relevance realization of your intelligence the division between head and heart and in buddhism you have a word that corresponds to both [3249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3249.839s)

that division is relatively recent and artificial in the west it comes after descartes and with the rise of romanticism and so you and we are all infected with decadent cartesianism and decadent romanticism we walk around graphing the world and then watching romantic comedies and both of those really mislead us into [3273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3273.3s)

how reality operates i think the second is more evil but we can talk about that another time so i have argued that agape and phylia philosophy by leah sophia which are forms of love i would also include eros but i'll talk about falina agape as we start talking [3297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3297.839s)

about eros somebody will clip this and we'll get on the net and look john's a pervert okay um by leah i think a romantic relationship even that we call it romantic relationships means the romantics won romantic love isn't romantic imagine if it was the world would be insane [3321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3321.66s)

filia sophia if we cannot when we do dialogical practices when when guy and chris and i do dialectic into dialogus and the practices people will often say i i i found it kind of intimacy i didn't know existed caring connectedness it's not it's not sexual it's not i didn't make a person's not my friend [3349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3349.68s)

they're not part of my family it's fellowship it's phylia and then the task is you create phylia which is fellowship love and then you direct that towards sophia wisdom absolutely central dialectic to be a logos is you're learning how to cultivate pylia how to cultivate sophia and have phylia [3374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3374.52s)

directed onto sophia so pylia is central to the cultivation of wisdom agape spinoza knew this plato knew this knew this spinoza you read spinoza it's like reading a math textbook axiom proposition proof theorem uh you read it and you read it and you read it but what does spinoza actually argue he actually argues that the blessed life comes from love not reason because reason can't break free from egocentrism on its own iris murdoch to love something is to acknowledge that something other than yourself is real that is what all of rationality is ultimately for but it ultimately is empowered by love caring about the right thing in the right way yeah socrates claimed that he knew that he did not know but he claimed to know erotica he claimed to know how to love he would walk into the marketplace and say look at all the things i don't need [3450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3450.359s)

you knew how to care this is absolutely central but we've got to give up we've got to give up that reason and emotion are separate from each other or not dimasio des carter think of the name of the book by the way you get people with brain damage so [3477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3477.54s)

their frontal lobes are disconnected from the more emotional centers of the brain the idea of either way that things are located prediction that idea this part of the brain does this is part of it it's going to be gone in 10 to 15 years in cognitive science that's like phenology it's cartography that doesn't actually apply to how the [3495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3495.78s)

brain works nevertheless these people have a kind of damage such that they're a bit that you can give them an iq test and they can fly at it they can do really well they don't care in the right way so you can destroy them by saying before you write the test before i write the test do you want to write it in red ink or blue ink [3515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3515.4s)

and then they try to calculate all the possibilities all the possibilities make it overwhelmed we have to have to stop this notion that affect and intelligence are separate from each other aristotle said it best he said look it's [3541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3541.319s)

not about being angry or not it's about knowing how and when to be angry at the right time for the right reason to the right degree cool so there are these sort of um different phases that we went through on rebel wisdom and also different kind of big themes and i often think of them as as kind of yeah sometimes i struggle whether to [3571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3571.14s)

start small and zoom out or do it the other way around but one of those so you know daniel later daniel schmachenberger will be speaking to the [[metacrisis]] um the the sort of many overlapping crises and issues we face as a species that's like a really big picture um and also what john was just sharing around the meaning crisis around uh you know how how we find meaning or or don't [3600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3600.299s)

and how we actually show up with each other and culturally that's also quite a kind of a big picture thing you know you could perhaps argue that it sits within the wider medic crisis the meaning crisis so that's at least certainly a way i've conceptualized it and then we have what we're actually living through in day-to-day life on [[social media]] in conversations with our friends in [3625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3625.5s)

conversations at work which has been a huge part of what we've covered as well on rebel wisdom which is the culture wars right the and it's really um the reason i sometimes uh struggle to figure out you know whether to start big and zoom in smaller go the other way around is because there's something about when we actually engage with these issues it's real and we feel it and it's [3647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3647.64s)

visceral and it matters because it could actually come up a conversation tomorrow with your friend or your partner or at work unlikely that the [[metacrisis]] is going to but possible depends where you work but um you know things that are really so big and complex are often harder to grasp and sometimes we can see the general in the particular and perhaps [3670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3670.74s)

more than more than most people we've had on rebelism i think aisha i can be sitting here um has this incredible ability to approach these questions of what's going on in the culture wars with a level of curiosity and empathy which is basically what we've been trying our best to model and often failing to be honest sometimes it's really difficult talk about these [3694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3694.02s)

topics i've always been really struck by aisha's ability to do that and and to really be in a space of inquiry and curiosity around what are really complex topics and often topics that we don't feel safe to discuss in in culture um so um we're going to talk a little bit about the nitty-gritty of [3714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3714.66s)

being a person uh in 2022 and online and dealing with all the complex cultural dynamics that we all have to deal with it's interesting that john mentioned before that any religion that can incorporate [[social media]] into it won't work i don't think i've ever heard the idea and i was just really i i felt an audible ah in the room when he said that and i think it's really important so [3736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3736.319s)

aisha thanks for being here numbers thank you for having me i just wanted to hear it again um so i thought so you are in the midst of writing a book yes called the awokening and i know from having just finished that process that um the process itself changed my mind [3763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3763.559s)

right there was a process of really wrestling with ideas could you tell us a little bit what is the book about and what have you learned writing it so far yeah so um the awokening is actually about how it's about my journey into i guess the culture was and how i found myself in a position uh where i was talking about these things that are quite [3787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3787.26s)

explosive um in public which is not what i generally have done i am a fashion stylist that's what i've been doing for the last 10 years so i'm swerving all the way out of my lane um and it's a the book is a journey about why that began and for me i you know it's interesting that we were talking about psychedelics earlier which [3808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3808.14s)

i haven't actually tried myself but in 2013 2014 i had a very naturally induced psychedelic experience that lasted about three to six months time was very hard to grasp you know at that point so it could have been potentially shorter or potentially longer but it felt like it lasted for about three to six months and this happened it was instigated after [3837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3837.119s)

the death of my brother which was very sudden um and i remember the only thing that i remember happening before this world opened up to me um is i remember having a night to myself you know a few months after he died where i was thinking about or it wasn't that i was thinking i i was trying to get to sleep and all of a [3862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3862.38s)

sudden like a slideshow of every question i never wanted to answer just kind of came to me it was like being cornered in a lift with someone that you hate um and all of these sort of questions about why am i doing what i'm doing you know why am i working as a fashion stylist what does fashion mean to me what does status mean to me [3882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3882.96s)

um what is the attraction towards brands my friends you know um are we friends or are these people habits in some ways that you know that i've just kind of grown a connection to simply because we know each other but how much do we really have in common um i was asking myself all sorts of questions that i wouldn't usually ask and i remember the person that i met on [3904](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3904.859s)

the other side of these questions was someone that i didn't recognize and i recognized that i was a lot more gray um and and messy than i i ever would have maybe not knowledge before and after that day my life completely changed i went through three to six months of absolute bliss and euphoria and everyone was wonderful and beautiful and everyone looked suspiciously good [3932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3932.52s)

um and it was a really incredible time i spoke to everyone and i don't know felt a deep connection uh with everyone and everything around me um you know i remember during this time really weird things you know i was very much an environmental philistine you know i knew nothing or i cared not much for nature and all of a sudden i was you know passing trees and weeping you know [3956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3956.88s)

it was a really odd experience and and then just like any high um there is a come down um and my come down was you know lasted much longer um than the initial kind of euphoric stage um and in that time i was seeking i was trying to work out or it suddenly dawned on me that this really beautiful magical [3980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=3980.819s)

experience that i had could have potentially just been psychosis mental illness um and but you know there was always something that that stayed with me that didn't allow me to jump to that conclusion too easily and so i was seeking um and i was you know trying to i didn't realize at the time because i [4007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4007.28s)

didn't speak even in the way that i might speak now the same vocabulary in language wasn't in regular use for me but i i think i was seeking wisdom so it's funny again that john mentioned that but i was seeking it in all of the places that i don't think it lives um and that's what kind of brought me into activism for a long while um i was you know [4034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4034.7s)

i i can't say that i was a an activist in the way that we might understand that word but you know i was at protest and i was meeting people and i was talking to people and interested in conversations around race around gender a lot of the the hot button issues that are still very thorny to talk about um and i recognized quite soon that whatever it was that i was looking for [4056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4056.839s)

in those people in those groups yeah it wasn't there um and actually i found that the ways that we are thinking around a lot of these topics and the ways that we are encouraged to look at one another was actually quite detrimental i knew that there was a chance that i could have had a psychotic break and i didn't want to go to [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4081.38s)

um a therapist at the time i was sure that if i kind of explained to the average therapist that i you know went through this amazing psychedelic trip and i i had all of these new powers or it felt like i had new powers and you know i was meeting all of these guides along the way that you know there's a good chance of what i might be told and i wanted to i wanted to really explore [4104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4104.9s)

whatever this was for myself and that's when i i guess i started to recognize um a lot of what was contributing to the the very prolonged state of depression that i had after that trip um and i yeah and i just recognized that a lot of the ways we're encouraged to think around many of these topics are exactly to be doing that and so the book is about [4130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4130.16s)

um it looks up [[social media]] you know it's my awokening to maybe what we've often called wokeness um waking up from it and realizing that um complexities you know is a beautiful thing and when you embrace it i've never thought of myself as empathetic and so whenever people you know say to me that [4153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4153.5s)

you you display quite a lot of empathy i've always been somewhat taken aback by that because i i don't think that's what i was trying to do but i think when you embrace complexity you reliably get there you know i think that's where that's the end point i think you just you know it's it's somewhat you know automatic it's part of that process [4174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4174.98s)

um and so the book is you know encouraging us to think um more i guess you know empathetically around some of these topics um and about the ways that uh you know the current state of activism is kind of um making us um keeping us distressed thank you that's a really lovely summary um it makes me yeah i'm feeling i'm [4200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4200.54s)

curious right now i'm remembering back to the early events that we did where we would rebel wisdom would be down the road and um reclaim uh and very often we would have a topic and we would have people come to discuss the topic it might be a little bit you know might be around gender or whatever it might something alive in the culture and the overwhelming energy there were [4221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4221.719s)

two things i really noticed one was always um oh my god it's so good to talk about this freely and it's just like this kind of cathartic release and then the second thing was always i have no idea how to talk about this right because it is really hard and over and over we in fact did a whole course with sarah ness and josh krum called the art of difficult [4241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4241.52s)

conversations because so many of us have no idea how to approach a topic like race or gender in a nuanced complex way you're really good at it so i wanted to ask you what do you think is needed what are some of the things that really help us have those conversations well i i don't go into any conversation you know assuming someone's intent you know i'm curious about people and [4267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4267.8s)

wherever their political perspectives uh or wherever their political loyalties wherever they may lie is is not really relevant to me i'm much more interested in why people think the way that they do um regardless of whatever the thought is and i think if you approach conversations with that in mind why do you think the way that you do what led you here uh what is your back story i [4290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4290.78s)

think you know after my brother died and i had this um euphoric experience and then even the one after you become extremely hyper aware of death um and i think you know i'm still like that and i think having death in mind very much has always made me want to know everyone know everyone quite deeply and to you know to to think of intimacy beyond um the romantic sphere um and so i'm interested in people i guess i'm just genuinely interested in people um and so that's probably why um i don't know i don't assume that people are are trying to be evil i think most people tend to think that their ideas are good you know rather than seeing the world as a combatim between [4339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4339.679s)

good and evil i think it's often you know competing ideas of what people believe to be goodness um and when i think of it that way that somewhere in this idea that i may find noxious someone sees something good and i'm interested to see what that is whether i agree or not um and so i think that's one of the ways but also i think in terms of gender and [4363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4363.199s)

race i guess it's because you know i'm uh i think about i think about um the ways that i have been influenced before i think about the times when i've had very um should i say a combative way of approaching things and why you know when i was a lot more you know binary in my thinking what was contributed to that [4392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4392.9s)

um i guess it's through my own self-exploration and kind of always being somewhat aware of um the muck within um it doesn't really allow me to kind of um i don't know approach anyone with a certain type of hostility i mean i guess i'm just very aware of my own dirt you know and i think when you are aware of [4418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4418.34s)

it it's much harder to kind of make these broad strokes about what other people are and i'm really interested in i don't know maybe alleviating or helping other people or reducing some of the the issues that we see in society and i think you can only do that when you're prepared to listen uh with a calm temperament when you are less inclined to make other people know how good you [4442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4442.82s)

are um in by condemning someone for how bad they are i think it just you know entirely changes the approach so um i guess it's curiosity you know maybe that's a really long way of saying you know it's curiosity and and not thinking of people in binary terms and remembering that you know i see lots of myself and everyone that i meet you know [4466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4466.76s)

regardless of their financial bracket their age their status and their religion i i always see elements of myself i guess also and that's there it's it's very hard to i don't know just um demean people just because it brings retweets you beautifully said um there's this really i think [4492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4492.14s)

fascinating thread that i want to pick up on it's something that we talked about in advance of the event because when i called you you were working on a particular chapter in the book and and has come through here as well which is this this link between so we have a mental health crisis in the west and beyond i would say um and then we also have a culture war [4510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4510.5s)

happening at the same time and i think it's very interesting to look at where those two things intersect um and we talk a little bit about it but i'm curious to to just kind of explore that a little bit like where where do they intersect do you see like what's kind of the relationship between our mental health and how we're showing up collectively in in you know in the [4530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4530.42s)

culture wars yeah i mean i i don't think it's coincidental that you know at the time that many people describe the world as feeling more mad than usual that we are also seeing many more people are open about their mental health struggles um and you know even for me when i was going through the worst of this calm down um what was important to me was finding community and when you're in a very vulnerable state um this is when you are prime uh to be swept up in movements uh groups that don't necessarily have your best interest and you know it isn't surprising to me that we have a mental health crisis when so many things that are corrosive for your mental health uh in many ways encouraged you know we're encouraged to think and quite binary times uh we do that that's how we kind of signal um loyalty to our tribes um that's how we you know you can't you have to see someone as a monster if you want a justification to fight them so you're not then so it then doesn't [4607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4607.1s)

make sense to kind of see the nuances in the gray in this person uh because then the whole reason your your sense of purpose is taken away but not only that we know there is a big currency in in victimhood um that i don't think has ever been there before um i think we're a lot more i think a lot of people you know in my uh opinion [4630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4630.02s)

over use the term um narcissistic but i definitely do think that we are self-obsessed um to a really unhealthy point and i think you know every time that i've explored what's going on with me when i felt the worst i can often kind of find lots of threads of just obsessing about myself obsessing [4653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4653.659s)

about what i think other people think of me obsessing about the weight of what will happen if i say this or you know it's just a complete you know self-absal spiral and when we're encouraged always to think about how this thing affects me and my group um and your identity there's such a [4676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4676.76s)

fixation on one's identity um that i think yeah it's a it's a recipe for yeah mental distress and so you know you often see people most vocal about um their mental health struggles often our activists you know a lot of the mental health awareness that has kind of come through in the last few years has been from many younger generations and [4700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4700.34s)

it has come through people who you know the be kind lobby as you know some people might refer to them um who don't necessarily display this to other people um so um i think the ways that you're seen as a reliable safe person and an ally and all of these types of things i think a lot of those [4723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4723.56s)

ways of being yeah of course mental distress so that's how i think they intersect and and as i said you know when you're when you're in the thick of it you're often searching for community you're searching for meaning you're searching for a way to make your life yeah mean something you know what is going to be my legacy and i want to be a good person and i've been told that [4744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4744.26s)

being a good person looks like this and often the way it looks is being perpetually angry you know being outraged um condemning this entire group of people so you instinctively are going to feel you know threatened wherever you go um and so i think for me yeah when i saw the ways that this was really bad to many of the people that i care about and [4767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4767.36s)

i felt like if you wanted to help group sort of you know described as vulnerable um teaching this really um self-sabotaging way of going about things is not the way to do it and i i couldn't unsee that and i yeah i i wanted to say something um i want to talk a bit about and then open [4790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4790.1s)

up the q a i want to talk a bit about [[social media]] um and i'm curious one aspect of this question is what you make of elon musk's twitter takeover how you're feeling about it um and then also just more generally you know uh how much oh and this is this is something i hear so many different [4809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4809.6s)

answers to and i swing back and forth how much of the polarization and culture wars would you lay at the feet of [[social media]] and the way the platforms are designed and how much of it do you believe is us you know this is a complex thing maybe um maybe we'll start with there and then we'll get on to elon musk um i i put a lot of it you know at the at the foot of [[social media]] um i think this is where many people have kind of um developed the idea that the way to be a good person is for one solely calling out bad people or is to be some kind of activist or is to feel threatened by this group or that group i think it's where we've learned that there is um the status is conferred on us when we [4861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4861.26s)

present ourselves sufficiently as victims um i think yeah a lot has been encouraged there i mean i don't think any of us were meant to know what so many people were thinking um at all and i i don't think we're equipped to deal with that i'm certainly not equipped to deal with that i mean i don't understand i mean even when i was [4882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4882.739s)

most active on twitter i never searched my timeline like that feels really masochistic to me um just because you know there's just so much there and so little time to process it it feels like i don't know like junk food like they're injecting it into my brain um and so but i think when you are in the habit of doing that every day and [4902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4902.84s)

the only way that you can kind of prove to people who can't see your actions that you are a good person is by what you believe um i i certainly think that um it you know a lot of the onus i think is on [[social media]] for the ways that the culture wars have manifested so yeah i i think yeah it has um a lot to do with it in terms of elon musk i've [4928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4928.28s)

i found other people's reception to that to be really interesting you know i see on on the one side you have lots of people like you know yay for free speech like this is going to be great we can say whatever we want um and things like that and you know you have other people who you know feel very cautious of this move and feel like it's going to be really dangerous i certainly [4950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4950.48s)

don't see elon musk as any savior and i don't think that he can fix the issues that are going on now because even if you can say whatever you want on [[social media]] um the problem is that we're now living in a world where what you say on [[social media]] can get you fired from your job and it doesn't have to be eight before it just has to be unpopular and so i'd [4971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4971.12s)

much rather keep my job than a [[social media]] account um so i would i don't know for me being able to say what you want on twitter no matter how controversial but still having to pay the penalty um in your real life because you know there is a a dominant ideology of how one should be or one should think and say on certain issues [4993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=4993.38s)

um doesn't seem like a real win to me um i don't use twitter that much at the moment um mostly because i have been working on the book uh but also because you know i think anyone who follows any public figure for long enough you know it doesn't happen to a few most people you see a sudden decline you know in their character in the way that [5018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5018.64s)

they speak you know the wisest or maybe not wise but very intellectual people who pride themselves on their sophistic sophistication and you know just descend into these adolescents um and it's really um i don't know i learn a lot from that you know and i think for me that's a reason at the moment why i'm kind of staying off and thinking about what is [5042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5042.699s)

driving this behavior um so yeah i do think you know once again yeah [[social media]] does play a large part in a sort of collective neurosis yeah i i would agree yeah i don't know what the percentage is but um yeah it seems to be significant um yeah there's a really nice concept [5066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5066.58s)

called value capture from a philosopher called i can never pronounce his last name but he's so good i always want to reference him but it's a cp in england uh yeah so but it's worth checking out there's a book called the art of games and his argument is twitter is a game basically right it made you you win by getting retweets and likes but games capture your values so the games have [5085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5085.78s)

its own value and then you might have your own value which is i want to have a really beautiful generative conversation full of love and twitter's like well that's not the game and our values aren't that so you have a choice don't play the game play a different game or play our game and that makes a lot of sense where you see this decline of value capture [5103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5103.659s)

happens in institutions as well you go into perhaps a charity with the best intentions and then slowly the the values get captured and i think it's a huge um aspect of the times we're living in just last question before we open up a q a um what are you most hopeful for in terms of our collective conversation and the culture wars like do you see things [5124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5124.179s)

shifting do you see things moving yeah i i think so i think we might be and again i'm not i'm not confident in this just because you know i i'm not looking at [[social media]] so much anymore but i am you know still getting lots of emails from people who you know on one hand do say that you know you know i'm glad i found you because you know i don't feel like i can have these conversations then [5146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5146.14s)

i also encounter a lot of people who do feel like the tide is shifting a bit and you can you know address things in potentially more nuanced ways without you know being called a nazi um and so i think that's progress for a lot of people um and so i think there is you know especially let's say around gender uh there does seem to be you know the more [5167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5167.38s)

people kind of come out and talk about negative experiences or where they were mentally when they made certain decisions i think there is some leeway around there um but i'm hopeful for more things like this i'm hopeful for um us getting much more wiser to the fact that you know [[social media]] is is corrosive to us in many ways i mean we [5192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5192.76s)

know it and we say it and it's a meme and it's trite at that point but like knowing something isn't really kind of really deep in it you know and i i don't think that's what we're doing with [[social media]] so i'm hoping that generations that are coming up will kind of look at this as a really you know boring use of one's time you know and you know there's much better things to [5217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5217.0s)

do in the world than kind of um putting yourself in this position where you're terrified of everything and you're seeing everyone in these really sort of um noxious ways and just paranoid i i'd like to think that this is going to be um a blip you know fair enough it's been quite a long one um but where yeah this seems you know [5238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5238.48s)

doing things like that um seems uh as childish as it really is you know i hope that happens so thank you aisha great we've got time before lunch for a few questions for q a so yes gentleman over here raises hand and kevin have you got a mic yeah and again online um if you have questions please put them in the chat and we'll take an online [5268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5268.659s)

question as well uh it's over here thank you um i've just come out of three years of a drama school which had quite a ideal ideological bias on and what kind of conversations and type of on how i could speak and how i could um and thankfully i think i over the three years i managed to navigate it with love in a decent way but i still feel a certain kind of mixture of resentment and fear around when certain conversations um certain catchphrases pop up and and then i get a either a certain [5321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5321.88s)

when i'm engaging with a person who uh that that that that archetype pops up and i see that um the archetype of wokeness or whatever um i either disengage switch off or i kind of like i i serve to it i don't i find it difficult to engage with that person with that curiosity and complexity that um i would like to [5351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5351.52s)

still um because i i i fear i don't trust myself i'll we'll start fighting and i don't want to do that um and i don't trust myself to enter that that trusting space listen compassionate things um and i wonder if you have any advice for how you can let go that and and leave people with more information and investing yeah i think it's a it's a good question it is certainly something i feel at times you know i think it is quite natural to feel a certain resentment when [5396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5396.639s)

you know you're having to self-edit and self-censor so much you feel like you're not being true to yourself and if you're not being true to yourself sometimes it's very hard to like yourself um and so i i do get that but you know in my case you know i don't know if you've ever been there but with my case i always have to remember that [5420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5420.82s)

you know maybe not to the same degree or at least maybe that's what i tell myself but i've been there you know i've and and i think if you think back to a time where you've had ideas that you now look back on that embarrass you and that you can't believe you thought that and you felt it and you thought it with so much conviction um if you think back to where you were [5442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5442.0s)

at that time and what was driving a lot of that conviction even though it was very deceptive i think it's um yeah it's a lot easier to see your past self in them i tend to and i'm talking to someone that has that archetype um i don't often say what i think as much but i do find myself just asking questions gently not to kind of do a [5468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5468.52s)

gotcha um but i think if i'm you know people like to talk about themselves you know and people like to think they're interesting and so i think if you come to someone and have made them feel that way by the time i think you if you do feel compelled to and share some of your perspective um i don't think it necessarily has to [5489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5489.82s)

go down as um explosively as it might have otherwise um and it's always about your language you know i often make sure when i'm talking to people because now there's so many kind of buzzwords and catchphrases that as soon as you use it people think they've worked out everything about you so you know if you use the word virtue [5511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5511.12s)

signaling some people will just assume that you're a conservative you know or if you even use the word woke you know then people will assume that um but often you know just i disagree is something that i think very much kind of can get people's backs up and so generally i don't often often use that word when i'm talking to someone i'm just like wow that's interesting because [5532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5532.179s)

i see it like this as opposed to i disagree with that you know because someone's generally already on the on the defensive and so i'm i'm very careful with the language that i use and make sure that i've given them enough space to um to share whatever it is they feel um without being yeah without being defensive um but i [5554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5554.739s)

think more so than anything it's just remembering you know i've been there in some way shape or formed and in many ways i think it is a youthful rite of passage um the problem now i think is that it's extended beyond youth for many people you know and it's become quite dominant uh amongst you know people teaching the youth um and that is unsettling to me um but yeah i think you know remembering that people are seeking meaning and reasons for the way of why their lives are the way that they are um and i think you know whenever i'm in my worst moment you know i can sometimes see the impulse i want to oh it's because of this it's because of that you know um and so yeah keeping that in mind it generally helps me i don't know if that's a helpful answer but yeah that's what i think good answer thank you yeah we're gonna take uh one from online you just gave me a horrible flashback to my in rand days when i was 19 as well you know this way but embarrassing ideas um yeah no but it's really yeah that's a [5620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5620.199s)

really lovely advice i think um so moving swiftly on uh we're gonna hear from someone online yeah that's right we've got a question from helen santos wave your hand helen up there on the board uh would it even be appropriate to fill an interest in the opposite point of view when in the face of outrageous actions like abusive relationships felia [5641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5641.139s)

murder etc what these are really these are the big ones how that affects our notion of right and wrong does that make sense yeah i think so so um is helen asking you know is it is it a good idea to have curiosity about everyone especially people who commit the most atrocious acts [5664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5664.84s)

i think so actually i think you know when my i mentioned that my my brother died um maybe what i didn't say is that he was murdered and and that is actually where this curiosity began i think the only way that i felt that i could cope with that situation without hating everyone uh which is um which only affects me you know was to [5691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5691.6s)

try and figure out you know and you know i'll never know but at least to speculate to be curious and to be imaginative about the kinds of thinking situations that lead someone to that point of view where doing something like that seems worthwhile um that doesn't necessarily mean you know from thinking about his motives where he was age peer pressure [5715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5715.78s)

self-deception um that doesn't necessarily mean that i wanna you know go out with this young man who did this for coffee but it does mean that i don't allow him to kind of take two lives because you know i could still be here um and not really living at all if i was to let the weight of what that incident did you know [5741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5741.88s)

completely um drowning so yeah it is actually from thinking about a murderer um uh where i i learned the value of curiosity in you know in being a shield against fear absolutely beautiful thank you for that i've got time for one last question before we go for lunch we've got about five minutes left and so you've got your [5772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5772.6s)

uh maybe this lady here music hi um i am struck often by the fact that many groups who we would typically associate with work movement often seem like to me that they're processing a lot of pain and then projecting that outwards and those aren't productive [5797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5797.38s)

uh so i was curious as to whether you've seen effective ways that groups can process and move through that in a more healthy way that then allows for connection yeah no it's um it's a hard one because you know it's the kind of person that we're talking about or that archetype that you know many of us may associate with the woke [5820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5820.54s)

movement you know who's generally the type of person who will tell everyone else to seek therapy seek help you know and so you know a lot of them are in therapy you know a lot of them are kind of are in spaces where they are processing this type of thing or not maybe not processing but at least talking about it so you know i don't see it as just something professional at [5843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5843.4s)

this stage or something that oh no an external professional kind of person may be able to help them with i i think you know the biggest shift in my life has kind of come through exploring my own propensity towards self-deception you know because that's i think i started thinking about self-deception [5867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5867.639s)

around the time that my brother died because i recognize that this person who did it must have told themselves a story you know a convincing story that made this okay and so i think a lot of what i share online and write about is trying to get us more comfortable uh with recognizing that we deceive ourselves in lots of different ways and that we do this to our own detriment and and perils [5892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5892.54s)

sometimes um and i think if we can or at least maybe all i can say is what i try to do because you know as much as some people would say that i should say or talk about controversial issues or say controversial things you know i don't get much pushback or i don't get people you know um slandering me very much [5914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5914.92s)

um and i think you know that is because you know i'm i'm i'm not necessarily or at least i hope i'm not climbing across like i'm i'm talking from the ivory tower you know i'm talking from you know a lot of the time someone who's also going through many of these distressing moments but i'm just trying to figure out a different way of how to deal with [5937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5937.12s)

it um so i don't know i think this is not maybe the clearest answer but i think we need to get comfortable knowing that um sometimes we are the architects of our own pain and that doesn't make us a bad person because we've kind of adopted bad thinking styles because you know it [5955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5955.48s)

could have come from you know the influence of that could have come from many different places but i think as long as people are always looking out there for the answer um i think yeah i think you end up staying in that state for a lot longer um but then also at the same time it's hard because there's a maybe a thin line between like self-exploration and just [5976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=5976.6s)

you know self obsession um and you know how you walk that line um is is a difficult one but again i think i'll just maybe settle on i think if we get comfortable you know knowing because i think that's what i don't see i think every time i often see this type of archetype you know talking about their suffering it's always kind of you know been imposed on them by some [6000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6000.54s)

external force um but maybe it's the way that we should start thinking about our suffering i often do think that suffering can be it has in my life at least it's been you know a great catalyst um for change positive change and i think an idea that needs to be introduced into the mainstream more is um what psychologists call [6020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6020.46s)

post-traumatic growth you know because we hear a lot about um ptsd and things like that but i i post traumatic growth is maybe what some people might think of as a spiritual awakening or some life-changing at the moment and i'm interested in how you can get to that place because i do think that place is maybe available to more of us than we think if not all i'd like to [6040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6040.98s)

believe is on the other side of our mental maladies but as long as we don't allow the mind viruses to seep it um completely at least you know i think that's waiting for people so yeah there is another side to all of this yeah amazing look at that the timing of the battery running out on the tablet is just [6069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6069.719s)

perfect aisha thank you so much that was absolutely excellent that was really a pleasure thank you yeah so my prompt for you guys is i mean i think one of the things that's exciting about this conversation is that it's well it's a [[metacrisis]] meets meaning crisis in some ways that's that's uh sounds like a horror movie i know right [6093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6093.659s)

yeah yeah so so um but i i'd like to just start with asking you just initially where do you each individually see those two concepts intersecting the [[metacrisis]] and the meaning crisis where do they speak to each other where do they overlap um so i've been asked that question a few times um and um for me part of the answer is this um i think the meaning crisis is an important instance of scarcity mentality so and human beings lack a particularly important resource it has very comprehensive effects on their cognition [6138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6138.42s)

they become very short-term they become inflexible in their thinking their insight capacity goes down this is very reliable and it doesn't have to be for food because people will actually give up fruit for meaning that tells you how important meaning is so when there's a meaning scarcity what it tends to do is really significantly limit the cognitive [6159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6159.9s)

and effective resources we can bring to bear on the [[metacrisis]] so i think one of the things that i'm interested in is that direction that the meeting crisis in fact contributes to an inability to properly get come to grips with the [[metacrisis]] in a serious way i think there's also a reverse error of causation i think the [6185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6185.52s)

[[metacrisis]] contributes to an ongoing and increasing sense of domicide for people the sense and if you're not familiar with that i i the domicide is the sense of not having a home and it doesn't mean you don't have a dwelling you can have a dwelling and still experience dharma so it's a sense of not being at home that you don't belong [6208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6208.56s)

um that there's a kind of fit between you and the world and this causes of course anxiety senses of absurdity alienation so i think as many people frame the world as dying that exacerbates the meaning crisis for them so i see the two having a vicious feedback relationship with each other foreign how they become like memed terms the [[metacrisis]] meets the meaning crisis it sounds like kind of markety um i mean they're facets of the same thing in the bi-directionality is clear and i just want to acknowledge that well we've both expressed what these things are and probably most people here [6262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6262.56s)

have taken it in some of it online the ability to actually unpack this adequately what what are visions of a world that instantiate meaning for people what do we mean by meaning um and what are visions of a world that address [[metacrisis]] both long term and how we get there and like there's just [6285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6285.6s)

no way we're going to do much so we're just going to like touch random spots here so a just a thought that came to mind is um joseph campbell has some statement i'm going to butcher it and you probably remember it as something like that uh humans ask what the meaning of life is [6305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6305.58s)

when they don't feel fully alive but they're seeking a sense of full aliveness i'm not trying to be reductive and say there is no important of some importance of some also cognitive sense of orientation and meaningfulness but one thing that i have noticed like philosophy and psychology have to work [6325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6325.94s)

together and not just philosophy and psychology but your physical health and lots of other things so i don't want to try to use philosophy to take the place of where psychology is important for people who are dealing with meaning issues is i wrestled with almost every type of cognitively generated at least in my awareness existential angst about [6345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6345.84s)

um determinism and free will and the hard problem of consciousness and the heat death of universe and all that for like you know like overly intellectual nerdy kids with big frameworks wrestle with um but it was actually not just the intellectual frameworks i was wrestling with like i was wrestling with those but [6370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6370.26s)

i started to recognize that uh when i fell in love i was not wrestling with them in the same way and when i was actually in really deep connection and community with nature i wasn't wrestling with them in the same way that there was a certain kind of similar to my friend who i said had to get on mdma because there was a state he was in that was then determining what [6391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6391.739s)

resonated um and so i started paying attention to it and very rarely did i see somebody's what they thought was cognitively generated existential angst very rarely did i see it survive falling in love and so i started to have a discipline with [6414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6414.42s)

myself that if i was in if i was asking existential questions i would look at non-existential issues in my life like am i really tired and is my health not that great and do my relationships suck and things like that that create a feeling where that i'm looking for ideas that map to that feeling and that i didn't actually feel like i had a physiology or a psychology that [6435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6435.0s)

was well tuned to address those heart problems in that place and it was so fascinating that when i just had the discipline of i'm going to work to try to make sure i'm tuned as a cognitive instrument first how different the entire process of existential meaning philosophy was yeah that uh that converges with uh an important aspect of my work where i [6459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6459.119s)

talk about different kinds of knowing um and uh so you have propositional knowing it's oriented towards beliefs stored in semantic memory you have procedural knowing generate skills stored in procedural memory you'll have respectable knowing that's about generating states of mind perspectives stored in episodic memory and you have participatory knowing which is how [6483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6483.6s)

attuned you are uh often the low levels of awareness to your environment and that uh that's sort of stored in this weird entity we call the self um and i think part of the meaning crisis is that we have a kind of propositional tyranny in our culture in which we are oriented to the propositional to the exclusion of [6506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6506.76s)

educating and cultivating the wisdom that i think is more found in the non-propositional kinds of knowing and so i think that's deeply right um and figuring out figuring out with the best science but figuring out about what is it we can do to best help people with that attunement has [6531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6531.42s)

been sort of crucial to what i've been trying to get at uh because i think our culture is so fixated on systems of beliefs that it really distorts people and distracts them and diverts them from exactly the kind of thing you're talking about yeah i heard you i heard you talking on a podcast earlier today and the interviewer was asking you what [6559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6559.159s)

about decreasing attention spans from [[social media]] and how kind of relevance realization gets hijacked and one of the things that um i have noticed is that the [[hypernormal stimuli]] whether through [[social media]] and kind of politics communication or um sugar fast food porn anything like that the [[hypernormal stimuli]] proliferate in hyponormal environments where the [6586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6586.92s)

authentic connection that creates meaningfulness is low and um it's very easy to see that like when friends go camping in nature with other friends they just check their phones less and when they're in a richer field of connectivity and creativity and experience and communication they're seeking that thing less so a huge part [6607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6607.38s)

for me of how do we deal with [[hypernormal stimuli]] obviously there is restructuring economics to not have [[perverse incentive]] to that scale because it's an asymmetric warfare that's a  up asymmetric war to just try to say the individual should have discipline against the multi-trillion dollar apparatus trying to hijack their attention so obviously it's not only an [6626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6626.1s)

individual topic or even a community topic but in so far as we want to look at the bottom up side of it it's not just how do we develop more delayed gratification and more discipline to avoid [[hypernormal stimuli]] it's how do we create a richer life of authentically meaningful and connective things so that you don't have a vacuum seeking some kind of stimuli [6648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6648.239s)

yeah i think that's really important um so harry frankfurt makes a very useful distinction between lying and that i i i've found very useful for thinking about this um the liar depends on your commitment to truth in order to manipulate your behavior they convince you that something is true it's not but because [6670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6670.98s)

you're committed to the truth that alters your behavior whereas the artist tries to get you unconcerned with the question of truth and only attracted because of the salience um this is how most advertising works you you all know that most of the advertising is false if i ask you an [6688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6688.139s)

interview after that do you really think washing your hair with that shampoo will make beautiful women or men come into your life you'll say no and then you buy the shampoo right and what what what what's really interesting about what you just said is unlike lies like it's very hard to lie to yourself technically but it's very easy to  yourself because all because [6709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6709.199s)

when you attend to something right that actually there's there's three dimensions that drive attention and one of them is your history of what you've paid attention to so when you pay attention to something you're more likely to pay attention to it so you're more likely to pay attention to it which means when you walk into the store it will leap out at you as salient and [6727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6727.92s)

that's enough to get you to buy the product or by the political idea and part of um what i think is happening is is it has a way of growing exponentially in a way that lying doesn't and so i think correction yes and avoiding error correction right because it uncouples you from do i understand this um like people people now confuse sending something that they haven't read on the internet with knowing what it was about music so the point i'm making is right there there's a degree in which yeah we [6776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6776.34s)

have to get people into these richer environments but i guess i i want to ask you a question is what because i'm trying to get an answer to this question myself what i don't just mean skills i mean virtues i mean so there's skill that has an aspect of skill and state of consciousness character trait what virtues do we need to give people to be [6797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6797.639s)

able to discern between lying and such that they are capable of properly proportioning their attention and what they find salient to the things that are actually connected did that make sense as a question it's funny because i was actually just about to ask you a question that i was wondering that [6819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6819.84s)

i thought you would have an answer to that i actually am going to avoid your question and do this one first and then come back to it because it might if you want to get i want to get to that but when i was listening to um listening to your talk earlier today and you're talking about relevance realization that oftentimes what we're not paying attention to is [6839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6839.1s)

critical and we recognize that and yet we don't have the literal neurological bandwidth to pay attention to literally everything um and there has to be some preferencing that happens so something like people who are very good at being able to tell what might be relevant that isn't totally obvious but that is [6860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6860.58s)

relevant to something else is one of the main cognitive traits i look for in people right and like if you want to work with me by the way if you're pretty good at knowing why something might be relevant to something else with good causal connections and then good at info compressing that then probably talk to me like that's the that's something i look for a lot [6882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6882.78s)

um but i would notice in my own learning process i have done something that looks a lot not like the normal approach to relevance realization maximization and i wanted to hear your thoughts on it for some set of reasons early on i started to realize that the things [6907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6907.08s)

that i didn't think mattered still totally mattered and i just didn't see the i just hadn't seen the causal connections and i started giving the benefit of the doubt that everything was actually important and that if anyone thought it was important i wanted to see through their eyes why they thought it was important and i remember one time as a teenager i [6925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6925.679s)

was sitting people watching with a friend who was a hairdresser and i had zero fashion awareness at all and she was watching all these things i could tell and i'm like what are you watching what are you seeing and she was talking about haircuts and fashion i'm like tell me actually like narrate your experience and she was talking about the [6944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6944.28s)

way that people's haircut shaped their face or didn't or brought out their cheekbones or and why it affected their mood and the way other people related to them and i'm like there's a whole  world i've never seen like i've never seen any of that and i think i'm seeing the world and so i'm like okay there's actually in interesting stuff in there and then i remember talking to a [6962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6962.699s)

mechanical engineer who was talking all about the slope of the curb and how water ran off and the nature of the screw threads on things and i so i just started seeking out every everybody who saw the world in the most different ways about things that i totally thought were not interesting and really tried to see why it was interesting and relevant so what i was trying to do was do the [6985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=6985.08s)

maps of relevance of the things that were outside of my current relevant set and it was um you know khalil gibran said uh he was in meditation upon the dew drop that i discovered the mysteries of the ocean and this kind of sense that in a completely interconnected universe the idea that anything isn't meaningful is actually at the basis of where violence [7006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7006.739s)

and externality happens so it wasn't letting my attention be diffused and not try to connect it or just be a distracted into like um without real salience but they're like i don't think i'm qualified to know what is relevant or not yet and i want to assume relevance and everything and then look for it i that might be maybe the most important or one [7033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7033.199s)

of the most important traits in my like educational proclivities and i was curious to hear your thoughts on that excellent versus other processes for pedagogy and for developing people and i will need a piece of your brain because he's a really interesting person um so um i mean i think you're still guiding that process by relevance realization because a lot of relevance realization is taking place unconsciously and etc and i'm sure you don't disagree with that but the deeper answer i think is that and i was privileged to work on paper with most of the academics doing work on wisdom and we were the point was [7077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7077.96s)

to actually produce a consensus theoretical construct and this will get to your point in a second and what came out as the key ability was a meta-perspectival ability so what thing most predicts the people that we judge to be wise is that they try to internalize perspectives other than their own [7103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7103.94s)

which is what you just described and they try to not but they don't just do it randomly like they don't like you said you didn't disintegrate right so they're complexifying they're simultaneously differentiating and integrating and then that when you internalize that that gives you metacognition you become more capable of knowing your own [7126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7126.44s)

cognition because you internalize the perspective of other people on you so when you take in multiple perspectives and complexify them so they have emerging functions you also complexify and drive the emergence of your metacognition which improves yourself knowing which then improves your ability to choose which perspectives to internalize [7147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7147.44s)

and you can get a positive feedback loop going and that sounds to me like what you just described how you would think about incorporating that kind of process into education so well you said a few minutes ago that if you wanted to change education you basically said but i need to change [7176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7176.54s)

the world um and so i want to say something similar um because i think we have to challenge this framework about what the entity we're educating is the embodied mind so we have this notion that cognition is sort of self-enclosed magnetic that it's monological [7201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7201.32s)

that we do our most of our cognition is done inside here it's monophasic there's one privileged state of consciousness we should be in and i think all three of those are fundamentally false and that the framework which we get from people like locke was built on those those three things and we have to bring in education [7226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7226.88s)

in which children are being properly trained not just taught properly trained in what i like to call theologos the kind of conversation that is designed to do exactly what you were talking about it's not just a communication sharing of information it's like no i want to get your perspective such that i can [7251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7251.54s)

internalize it we may not agree but something emergent is going to happen for me because i've internalized your perspective and i try to afford you doing the same so we afford each other self-transcendence we have to get that to be a crucial part we have to train our kids to explore altered states of consciousness so that they get a sense of whoa my [7269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7269.36s)

salience landscaping is way more malleable than i realized and there's all kinds of powers and there's all kinds of perils i think if you did just those two things you would already start to enhance this ability i was talking about just take the first one that you mentioned yeah you can see how that is actually an answer to [[conflict theory]] and to metapolitics writ large at the sociological scale it's the answer to externalities because the externality that is created is created by some group of people solving a problem where they're not in enough communication with enough of the other people in the landscape that would see where the externality was so enough complex perspective seeking and desire [7313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7313.639s)

to synthesize them the two sources of all the problems in the world is [[conflict theory]] and [[mistake theory]] the way that i frame it problems that we cause on purpose and problems we cause on accident and they both get addressed through that as does the meaning crisis as does psychological cognitive depth and complexity so um it's a pretty good starting place [7332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7332.9s)

for me it's the heart of what um i get from the whole socratic tradition can you get to a place where you can really realize that the process of self-examination and self-knowledge is inherently bound up with affording other people to enter into you like to get that meta perspectival loop running that this is [7356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7356.9s)

what i this is the great lesson i keep getting from socrates is like like i i get kind of pissed when people talk about finding themselves as if there's something ins if i just go deep enough inside i'll find the magic kernel that is shows how wonderful i really am right where where where but we're talking what we're in fact trying to do right now right the more i can see through your eyes and i'm drawn to because you're a powerful thinker the more i can internalize that i think the more i'll understand myself but the more i can also afford you doing that and then that means that we have an ability right to like it doesn't just you know this it doesn't just go up [7404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7404.659s)

linearly our ability to cooperate and coordinate goes up exponentially okay so a folly in this that i want to speak to is there's the capacity to take other people's perspectives seek to be able to steal management seek to be able to communicate it so well that they have nothing to add that is totally performative it's rhetorical and it [7429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7429.08s)

doesn't have any real interiority and it's super dangerous and um you know we'll see lawyers who are trained to be able to defend either side regardless of believing in it just through kind of rhetorical capability and there's an attraction to meta paradigmatic work that an ego can have because you sound really smart yeah and you can win debates by always [7451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7451.219s)

including in transcending and whatever um and but it's devoid of the actual give a that is the motive that i'm interested in yes which is not just wanting to be able to say what the other person would say but be able to actually experience what it's like to be in their shoes deeply enough you can't actually separate yourself later [7474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7474.32s)

excellent and of course again back to the socratic paradigm you describe socrates mean combatants the sophist and they prided themselves on that that they could make any argument win and for me they are they're they were they're consummate artists because the truth was irrelevant all that mattered was making some salient to win now i this is interesting [7496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7496.52s)

i want people who give a about truth but who are pretty humble in their idea of what true means yes both in terms of the complexity of epistemology and ontology and who give a about good and beautiful and about just in a very real non-cognitive sense the actual [7519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7519.02s)

experience of other sentient that's exactly what i was going yeah because socrates of course famously argued that his the core of his wisdom wins it was that he came to know what he did not know he had to learn it ignorance um but he also protests himself to be a lover so the way you can maintain the humility like if i ever claimed to know my partner the way i can know it [7547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7547.4s)

like a chair right that's the end of my relationship right to be to be in and she's an astonishing person to be in love with her is to is to understand that i want to know i want i want to afford i want to internalize her i want to afford herself transcending through me she affords it for me but i never [7574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7574.82s)

i never want to frame her as a problem that i've grasped yeah she's always a mystery that will elude any attempt to grasp her and that's what that that so in socrates right be promoted in practice that capacity for that integration of humility and love and so the way we we look for the people that aren't bullshitting is [7604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7604.52s)

we don't just pay attention to the propositional we ask questions about yes but what are their virtues do they do they give me good evidence of humility do they give me good evidence like so much could be fixed if people would just love wisely you yeah i'd like to share a tip with people about how to tell the virtues that are [7629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7629.179s)

real versus the ones that are signaled that i learned very very late in life the hard way and probably still missing things on but it's so simple like it was so simple that i realized i was psychologically in some way to have not recognized this no but i mean that seriously and it's my friend zack stein and many of you probably know introduced me to the psychological [7658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7658.58s)

concept of selective inattention like places where you have a blind spot because it defends some psychological frailty and i think um the untrustworthiness of other people was something i tried to turn a blind eye to as a survival strategy to believe in people in childhood and so and then just hold this redemptive focus that could make everybody trustworthy and you [7681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7681.08s)

know whatever so um after having some experiences of really really trying to build trust where all of the indicators said that that was a dumb idea and not possible whatever um and finally giving up painfully with it i asked a friend who diplomat and wise in this way how how the do you decide who you trust and he said [7704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7704.3s)

something that was so obvious and like i couldn't believe that i had not done this and you guys all might think it's obvious because you went to school and just like learned who not to trust at school it's a place that i didn't learn but he said if they're an adult if they're not still young and developing if they're 30 40 56 years old um look at the relationships in their [7726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7726.08s)

life that they've had for a long time and if the kind of relationship you want to have is very different than the ones they have it's probably not going to happen you're probably not going to be the first one to have a very different relationship with them the existing relationships in their life that they're a common denominator of is a good sign because [7742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7742.52s)

they might with it they might even themselves and then other people where it seems like they have these virtues long term that typically plays out right and so he's like look at the relationships that they've had for a pretty long time and try to find the ones that aren't there anymore you know and just get a sense of it i was like [7762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7762.139s)

duh and but it's amazing how simplifying of painful experience is that one heuristic can be and it's not absolute of course people can change and yeah yeah um yeah i try to tell my kids to at least learn about the family of somebody they want to enter a romantic relationship with um and i did that in this case and my partner's family they're amazing people it's it's like want to be around them it's just they're astonishing and and so um i think that's really good advice i've i've also adopted a heuristic and it again seems really maybe simplistic but i've been finding [7811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7811.04s)

it very valuable how often do i see somebody engaging in an act of self-correction that has long-term consequences for them that for me makes them more trustworthy for me because if they are willing to do that they they are willing to correct their behavior and they're also typically again it's a heuristic they're willing [7835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7835.04s)

to listen and and that um that to me has been very valuable yeah i'll say the what i think is probably pretty close to identical and um way i've been thinking about it is um as i was just mentioning i had a blind spot everybody has blind spots like pretty much by definition [7855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7855.38s)

so a psychologically healthy person should be seeking their own blind spots right you should this is actually something that makes so little sense to me is why people in leadership positions in particular knowing the emperor has no clothes story and knowing that if you're in a leadership position people will you in the s menu and whatever like why [7876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7876.8s)

people in leadership positions aren't scared as that they have blind spots that are damaging things they care about that nobody's telling them like i'm scared of that i'm like i don't i don't want to be messing up stuff i care about because i don't know so i'm actively trying to get people that are really honest who will tell me those things and i'm still knowing that [7894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7894.98s)

you know it's a challenging thing so um blind spots aren't the problem but defended blind spots and so one of the things that and this is kind of very cluster b in particular is ideally i'm interested in people who are actively seeking their blind spots next is at least to a receptive but if someone has defended blind spots [7917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7917.84s)

meaning they get mad at you for pointing it out or at most give you some kind of like performative thank you and then push you away or something um and they're not what specifically not willing to be held accountable to change that's a sign that i probably don't want to work that closely yeah you probably know that as people go up the hierarchy too their ability to [7940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7940.159s)

take the perspective of others drops down significantly um which may exacerbate the very thing uh you're talking about i i i'm concerned about that issue too a lot and you know in even before whatever this is even as a professor i was concerned with that um so can we go back to your virtue question sure will you reframe it again [7962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7962.179s)

what are the set of virtues that yeah what so i would say the virtue and the virtuosity that allows one to reliably regularly and reliably discern uh bullshitting from lying so that people can reorient towards the kinds of connections that actually do sustain meaning in life i i grew up watching krishnamurti so i had just such a affection for him but i [7999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=7999.26s)

remember talking to other people who didn't grow up with that affection and they're like why is that dude pissed off all the time and because he would start us talking he'd be like can we take this serious can we be very serious about this thing and but he was trying to say like how do we actually solve human conflict and i don't want to be just saying this as [8021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8021.639s)

entertainment and you go home and nothing changes like do you also give a about solving human conflict and the meaningfulness of life so similar to the thing i said about her parents like take the meaningfulness of your kids life more seriously but then also have less certainty that you know how which means that you have to be engaged in the [8038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8038.619s)

process with them um it seems like to the degree that someone actually does take life as meaningful in their own life is meaningful that's a pretty strong resilience to like it's it's um you know repellent right because it's pretty someone has this relevance filter of is reality happening because meaning [8067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8067.3s)

can't be detached from reality right and if i don't get the sense of realities happening then i want to kind of quickly move through that that seems to be the most fundamental one to me is actually like a um i mean obviously there are epistemic skills obviously there are psychological insights to see if people are [8088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8088.179s)

bullshitting like we just pointed out but it seems like the most uh and there's obviously a mindfulness to even be paying attention am i just being entranced and entertained or not to like i don't want to take all those for granted but the depth of care about how each of the moments of our life are being invested seems to be the heart of it [8107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8107.86s)

motivationally what do you think yeah i mean the the knowing the the that's what i meant about loving wisely knowing how to care properly proportionally um seems to be the key thing um and and and and so two two things come up for me one is first of all what you just the first thing you said about [8133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8133.06s)

there's a deep connection between meaning at least how i'm using it i think it's how you're using it and the connectedness to reality um and part of the problem is that that is not sort of the default mode in which people understand meaning most people we know there's good research to show that people conf that [8160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8160.42s)

these three things are different um wealth and socioeconomic status subjective well-being and meaning in life and our culture has collapsed them all into one blob right um wealth only contributes to improved subjective well-being sort of how good [8178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8178.98s)

you feel i'm feeling pretty good that's subjective well-being and wealth it only makes a significant difference to that when you get out of poverty once you're out of poverty you have to have huge increases in wealth to make minor differences in subjective well-being so it's actually irrational to be primarily wealth driven the problem is so those two things are [8199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8199.42s)

confused and then okay but subjective well-being i should feel good well actually subjective well-being and meaning in life can vary independently a really good way of seeing that is to have a kid when you have a kid all of the measures that contribute to subjective well-being go down your finances go down your health goes down you don't sleep your [8218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8218.8s)

partner doesn't like you as much as they used to right you're getting diseases like every by every measure by every measure subjective well-being goes down why do people do it they want to be connected to something that has a reality and a value independent of their own existence you can ask people what's what is meaningful to them and if you want to [8240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8240.88s)

get at this you ask them what would you like to exist even if you don't right and so part of it is like that's the first part how do we get that like we gotta break apart that muck that conflation and then we have to properly re-understand love about that again our culture is messed up about this because [8272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8272.439s)

we think love is a feeling that's ridiculous like that's it's like love isn't a feeling well it's an emotion no it's not because love can make you really sad it can make you really happy it can make you really angry it can make you really jealous it can make you really frustrated love is an existential stance it's a way of committing yourself to a [8295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8295.66s)

particular connection to the world especially to a particular person and their world our culture this is why romantic comedies are so atrocious because they aren't just i mean seriously because they're designed to convince you that infatuation is what love is have you when have you seen a movie [8318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8318.7s)

about this couple's been really happy for 30 years so what i'm saying is we need to we need to re-understand i'm proposing to we need to re-understand love is a virtue and we need to re-understand meaning in a way that prioritizes the thing you said which is that connectedness to [8343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8343.899s)

reality to to being to want to be connected to something that has a reality and a value independent of your egocentric existence yeah yeah i like you saying love is a kind of existential stance um specifically saying rather than love is an emotion that there's all of these [8369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8369.7s)

emotions that love can elicit um have a rabbi friend that says at the heart love arises from clarity of perception because when you actually recognize that the person that you're perceiving has interiority and it exactly them has never existed and never will exist again and there's perfect irreplaceability of what they are then there is this kind of irreplaceable thus infinite value and the recognition of that value and meaningfulness is the existential love that you said so then i can get angry at someone who's going to hurt it i can get afraid of it being harmed all of those emotions arise from the love because if there wasn't love i [8419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8419.979s)

would give no shits this is great i quoted this quote earlier i don't know if you've heard anything it's a favorite quote of mine and uh it's from a gem of a book the sovereignty of the good by iris murdoch um she said you know love is the recognition that something other than yourself is real and i think that's exactly that is that it's that profound weight there's a there's something other than me but he is really real like see how useless the language is unless you can say that but yeah i i mean i think our deepening relationship with perception and cognition and meaning uh [8465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8465.34s)

there are things that happen in every day but there's a few points that stand out um a couple of them for me i think i'll share maybe i'm curious if you would too because jonathan was just telling me yesterday that telling more personal stories is important um yeah i've had people say some of the things to me i remember i was like 16 or 17 having this experience where i was i was meditating and then i opened my eyes and i was watching the sunset in this beautiful area and i was just kind of in awe right kind of a everybody's had that experience but in awe at the beauty of [8508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8508.3s)

this planet and nature in the sky and everything and then i had this self-reflection of like if i have the choice as some unincarnated spirit uh if i had the choice to incarnate and experience every difficulty i have ever experienced to just have this one moment i would totally do it [8531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8531.58s)

just for this one moment as opposed to nothing right like the it's infinitely valuable basically infinitely precious and like thought totally like i i the other things don't matter at all rel ative to the depth of experience and then i realized that i've had thousands of experiences for which i would incarnate an entire life just for that [8554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8554.08s)

one experience and then when i really reflected on that i'm like the the ongoing what's in it for me shifts right and then there's a sense of like i have already experienced many many lives worthy of living and the fact that more stuff keeps happening is just gravy and is awesome [8580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8580.42s)

and i appreciate it but all future life is not insured to have that yet and not everyone else has had as much fortune and i can actually do something about that not just my own experience and so with that recognition came a kind of depth of gratitude that comes a kind of obligation to other sentient experience yeah and i i find that like everyone i trust [8605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8605.92s)

the most has had an experience like that and until somebody has the what's in it for me hungry ghost thing creates some degree of untrustworthiness like all [[conflict theory]] still comes from that um yeah i've had similar moments um but music um us there was a this will make me sound more nerdy than you but i was reading marcus aurelius i loved reading mark israelis and and you know you can know something but you don't know it like uh tolstai has the death and the ivanillich ivanillich always knew he was going to die the way you [8659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8659.68s)

know that two plus two equals four but one day after he hurt himself ivan knowledge knew he was going to die does that kind of shift and i and i and i got it that like and you like when you say it it sounds we we we're so concerned we think we can alleviate the hungry ghost [8683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8683.8s)

by somehow maximizing the horizontal dimension of our life how long it's going to endure and the fact that it gets ended ultimately undermines that and renders our lives somehow meaningless and aurelius picks up on a thing from seneca he said even when you're in a corner you can jump jump into the sky even if you're painted into a corner and [8707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8707.859s)

then i realized and then marcus realize basically said but almost like exactly like you but if i have that one moment of infinite depth doesn't matter how long and i really got it i really got it and i got it to a point where don't take this the wrong way like i still won't step into traffic or you [8731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8731.74s)

know you know stand close to radiation or anything like that but a kind of visceral fear of dying left me um and for me um yes like you i want to know people who [8750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8750.46s)

have experienced that depth um but in addition to the ah way i'm also interested in people that have experienced it in the awful way uh one of the ways this person i met in my life at a very pivotal point in my life said to me john don't get into relationship to somebody who's not experienced grief [8772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8772.66s)

because grief is the eye that you get the eye that allows you to see the holes in other people where they've been hurt and if they haven't had grief they haven't they haven't had to confront that vertical dimension um and so i also look for people i think people who have and our culture again doesn't handle this well we [8799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8799.72s)

try to push it aside or or or give the hallmark card it's all right it's like no it's not right grief for me is going through grief and people have gone through it and like they get something can i tell a short story over on this it's my it's my that's one of my [8827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8827.8s)

favorite stories from the buddha this woman comes to him and her son has died child she is torn by grief and she says will you resurrect him now the buddha always refused to perform miracles in fact he said this is how you know somebody is not one of my disciples [8849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8849.76s)

if they offer to perform a miracle that's very good advice by the way but she keeps pestering and pestering and pestering him he says okay i'll do this for you you have to do one thing for me go into town you have to get a mustard seed you said i can do that no no no you have to get a mustard seed from a household that has not tasted grief so she goes hello do you have any mustard yes yes has anybody in this house science grief yes i lost my brother she goes to the next one same thing next one same thing next one same thing and then she goes oh she goes back to siddhara and she said thank you that also for me is so yes i want people [8895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8895.8s)

that have experienced those moments of extasis that take us beyond ourselves but i also want people who have confronted the depths of despair that take us beyond ourselves and come out of it yes and maybe just briefly we're about 10 [8919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8919.899s)

minutes left just want to let you know yeah i like that buddha story um i read a quote and i don't remember it was attributed to some indigenous tribe and i don't remember which one um but it said uh people who can't grieve together can't make good choices together and i thought it was really insightful because the choices we make will have some consequences some of which we can anticipate some which we can't anticipate and to take responsibility for the fact the choices we make are going to cause some harm like how do we do that right excellent um yeah it's interesting the same rabbi [8962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8962.92s)

friend in our like second conversation asked me if i was post-tragic as a way of trying to see if that's trustworthy which was um if you haven't gone into devastating tragedy and then come out on the other side of it no idea what's going to happen to you when it does happen and so it's it's interesting because i think [8985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=8985.359s)

only if someone has experienced the beauty of the world enough that it's both sacred and they're committed to it for everyone else and they feel full which doesn't mean they can't want and enjoy more just means they don't need it in the same way and only if someone has gone through saying well one hard thing's enough that they're kind of character emerges but [9009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9009.479s)

also ideally things that devastate their previous sense of self in world view so there is then some new self that has to emerge but then another one i would add is um trauma healing is really important because you can get resilience gifts and you can get philosophic insights and you can get strength from going through things and [9036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9036.06s)

still be left with a shrapnel and it has an effect and one of the things that i've noticed in terms of people's fear of death is that they're unresolved trauma gets projected into the unknown and that to the degree there's a bunch of unresolved trauma then death and the dark and the unknown are scary because my again it's that what seems true is [9057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9057.12s)

that which resonates with what it feels like inside and i can't be really good friends with the unknown if my experience of the known actually feels overwhelmingly traumatic right because that's what gets projected so i think having trauma and getting through it working through the way that trauma lives inside of us being connected [9077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9077.04s)

enough to the trauma and the rest of the world that we aren't narcissistic and being connected enough to the beauty we've already experienced and the intrinsic irreplaceable beauty and everybody else like all of those are parts of what's necessary i think that was beautiful and well said music um yeah i i i i like that idea i hadn't heard you say this before um the uh it's sort of the opposite of uh it was a decker rebecca it's becker yeah yeah that that but that idea that you can do the epicurean game with people like well i'm afraid of non-existence well it didn't exist before your birth does that terrify you [9122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9122.28s)

no you can't possibly experience non-existent so why are you scared of it oh when like and there's a sense in which that can provoke people but i find that those like when i do that it's it doesn't do much right because it's sub semantic yeah yes exactly exactly and and that's exactly the point [9144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9144.899s)

well back to like you know somebody who's pro properly processed well it's a heuristic but you get a good sense of how they can behave at a funeral because the people who shut up and sit beside the person who's grieving and know how to be fully present with them are the only ones that help [9170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9170.7s)

and it's really hard for people to shut up and really do that and i think it's i hadn't put this together but i think it's because they're doing exactly they're trying right they're they're projecting into the void and then they're trying to ameliorate their own projective fear in what they're saying to the person behind [9197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9197.52s)

them does that land with you yeah that's just that just those came together for me just now yeah the um instant comfort someone who's grieving and um tell them the person's in a better place and aren't you grateful that you knew them and whatever even if that's true and even if that's where the person [9217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9217.8s)

will inevitably come either that means that person has never been through it or it means that they well they've never been through it right like they went into it couldn't deal with it and so there's a bypass of their own experience and obviously i can't empathize with you in depth an experience that i'm trying to avoid at myself which is why that question of post-tragic right if someone is going to a specially lead anything which also means lead people who will go into tragedy you better be able to be  with them which means able to be within them those dimensions of self too yeah for me that's for me that's where any when if people [9259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9259.02s)

have any virtue or virtuosity in the non-propositional that's where that's the kind of situation where it really shows itself right that that the capacity for comportment that um is the only thing that's actually comforting in those kinds of situations and then i wonder but i wonder about [9276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9276.479s)

what you just said also because there's similarities right between grief and wonder wonder makes you call your world and yourself into question and so does grief so i'm also one learning to be with other people when they're ecstatic is also something we don't but so easy to obviously if someone is not capable of being with ecstasy in [9299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9299.76s)

themselves because of repression or embarrassment or whatever they might not but also if they're in their own lack and scarcity they might just go directly into envy yes so someone's ability to be with other people's pain and also their ability to be in celebration about other people's joy with regardless of whether they're in the same win or not is [9320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9320.399s)

definitely also a huge part of psychological health and trustworthiness so now that we're running out of time i'll ask you a question that should take about four hours to answer which is the the place where people had got that kind of education was usually within religious frameworks and yet for most people you know all the data on the nuns and so forth these are [9345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9345.6s)

not viable homes for the new models and often not because they don't believe in the propositions it's because they regard what is happening in that world as fundamentally irrelevant to them it's non-viable like when james talks about propositions that are just aren't viable for you you can't even consider the two folks who just can't keep them on foreign how do we you ask me an [9367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9367.439s)

education question i want to know what you think about how do we get the kind of multi-scale comprehensive self-organizing education in this kind of thing without the legacy of religions and you know this part of the project i have about the religion and it's not a religion how [9392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9392.7s)

do we how do we properly understand that functionality in a way that doesn't commit us to a world you that was born in the axial age and is increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of issues we're facing people still fall back on religion when they have to go to the funeral or whether going for the wedding or when there's a person like there's still all [9416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9416.939s)

of this they know that they there's something they there's a sense that part of it's just cultural inertia but there's also a sense no no these are i there's something i need guidance at these you know these pivot points in my life where should they go i think there is both a version of reifying deepening and updating the [9443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9443.359s)

existing religions it actually matters as well as the development of new ones um i think the end the entire islamic world in the near term is to abandon islam i think there are actually ways of relating to what's there both in terms of the belief systems and in terms of the inner development and tribal or [9465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9465.96s)

cultural development process there are much more life enhancing and less life enhancing versions of it so i think actually the support of the health healthy updates and reification of those traditions is actually part of the story uh as well as kind of new philosophic schools philosophic psychologic etc [9491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9491.1s)

i think it's very easy to see it's very easy to critique all of the problems of religion that make us want to get rid of it and um to see how either it was purely a power play or got co-opted by power plays but it's also pretty easy to see that there were authentically meaningful processes whether it was [9514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9514.02s)

how to work with psychology how to develop morals and ethics how to create shared numinous experience with others where you had a basis of trust with each other that was actually beyond life and death meaning that there was something that mattered to you the question you asked of what what do you care about even if you don't exist anymore have a whole [9533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9533.04s)

group of people that all hold something as sacred beyond their own life that is shared creates a basis for trust through a transcendental process that's profound for culture right um and so one of the reasons i think a lot of people go back to religions after a more scientifically [9554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9554.34s)

literate worldview is because of the need out of existential flatland and you know ken and lots of people have talked about the kind of regress to something that has existential depth even if it seems less intellectually congruent obviously we don't want to have a trade-off between intellectual congruence and um and meaningfulness um i would argue that the most deep wise charitable interpretations of many of the religions are actually profound and uh and commensurable with scientific knowledge i know you have a relationship with [9596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9596.34s)

taoism i wrote this piece called the dance of the dao and the ten thousand things it was saying they can dance together and basically the study of the ten thousand things is what i would think of as science and kind of pharmacological epistemology and i'm talking about how that even in the limit never brings you to the dow and yet it's not worthless and it [9619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9619.14s)

doesn't have to obscure the dow but it usually does and so how does somebody relate to the fact that the limit there's like a there's a con there's something wrong in the leibnizian concept of the limit which is when you factor that that algorithm has to process on some computational substrate that takes time to get to infinity takes eternity which [9637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9637.62s)

means you never get to infinity you always have some trans-finite thing and so whether you think of it that way or you think of the kind of girdles theorem or tarsky's theorem of it there is a binding to the ontologically unknowable and sacredness being bound there which is also has to be at the core of governance theory because what are you [9659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9659.7s)

optimizing for the the dow that is nameable is not the eternal dao the metric set that is optimizable is not worth optimizing for and so that really up ai governance ideas as it should right we don't want to disintermediate complex wise human judgment that is connected to the unknown unknown set becoming increasingly known and yet [9685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9685.26s)

always in relationship to the unknowable um and so there's a way that we can relate to the science right the ontology of the separate things into parts name them create a syntax for that there's a way that we can relate to that that can actually sensitize us to the dao rather than desensitize us where we [9709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9709.2s)

actually become aware of how complex and orderly and profound everything is without thinking that our knowledge that ever converges on everything so we stay completely bound to the unknowable and we actually just get greater sense of the depth of what that means through the extent of the novel and in that way the ten thousand things [9729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9729.12s)

in the dow can dance and it's kind of in that right so when we talk about religion there's a relationship to the unknowable but it's not separate from the relationship to the process of knowing right that you they have to be co-developed and um no i didn't really answer the question [9748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9748.38s)

of like what do i see the future of education and culture and everything being that develops that it's obviously also going to start with parents at one level right and different there's bottom up and top down and kind of medium ways it can start i'll say i agree that it is critical and i agree that it's a conversation that needs more time [9771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9771.84s)

well i i just want to say i felt tremendous resonance with everything you said it aligns with convergent and not in a dismissive way with a lot of how i see my project it would be great if perhaps even i had a conversation about just that let's do it yeah applause music well um it's really hard to follow daniel and john mccarthy it's probably it would have been my worst nightmare too and a half years ago actually two and a half years ago i probably would have left but um so what we're doing here today is we're going to do a session to reflect on our journeys in the context of verbal [9837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9837.0s)

wisdom and invite you to reflect on your journeys using our questions to reflect on what it meant to you and i noticed the sliding scale of intensity for different people and a sliding skill of transformation but we want to use these last moments together to really honor what it has been and what you will be so um like my my journey and next we um uh i was gonna say we're intense people but maybe not we're passionate maybe better but so we um we really went like full on with rebel wisdom because i just think it was very cold so as abby was saying we did a lot of things that you're going to see in the presentation but um i so we're calling the session [9887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9887.1s)

um life cycle sensing session and what we're going to basically is um you know what i said it's a hero's journey and throughout with anybody to reflect i just want to say too that i came all the way from australia and nick came from new york can my my girl when i told her that i was gonna come here and speak and she said whatever you do don't [9911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9911.34s)

look at anyone don't cry and pretend to be confident and i'm about to just talk to him foreign music music laughter and through so i'll be very young and come to a point to that yeah [9974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9974.84s)

um so we're meeting for the i flew in this morning from new york we're basically the first time we've been each other for three years so the discussion is yeah oh we're holding this way yeah here we go um so we'll talk about our journey and the reason we took all the chairs out as well because we also want to hear about [9997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=9997.68s)

your journey so it's a little bit of a participatory this is what happened before this is what happened when we got here there's a rebel together and this is what we're thinking about next but that's the final part of it now by its home what what's the scenes are we going to scattered out of the closing level five and um we'll also be moving around the room [10020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10020.3s)

a bit and we'll also moving in and out with head and felt sense as well so we'll be kind of moving up and down the volume as we do some of these exercises together music um and that's it yeah we'll over to you for the first exercise okay so um so as i said we um [10043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10043.76s)

we traveled from you know australia and new york so we wanted we thought it would be interesting to see how many people traveled to come here so we wanted to invite people to travel two hours to come here to move to the thank you i do travel less as well as indiana i just have a look around of the amount of people that traveled more than two [10086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10086.66s)

hours a day here again as much revealed and how about more than five hours so the two hours three hours four hours moved here and there was more than five hours to stay here music music and how many people travel 10 hours it doesn't recognize my sister [10129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10129.04s)

all right and again and how many people travel just more than 15 hours all right so we're gonna we're gonna um move you back here okay thank you so much yeah thank you so much i'm gonna carry on your body check in okay you just pray like this is this is [10167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10167.8s)

like what we're dealing with it so uh in the room so energy if you are these are my words let me guess which one of these two is my word my word was acted and they're working so so if you're feeling quietly we'll do it all together at the same time do you feel in more slowly also affects like i think you're feeling the medium unless you're feeling naked you go down a bit like that just so we [10197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10197.899s)

can feel like how's the energy in the room regardless music all right all right so so as you can see we have another ton of rehearsals we're just like themselves um so now it's it's kind of sad so you know there's a lot going on in the end of you and there goes absence and the [10239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10239.479s)

closing and what next and all of that so yeah that's a real cool so if you're feeling generally music and i'm assuming the people from the back are coming closer it's just you don't have room to come home um so yeah so i'm noticing that i feel um so i feel extremely tired when i film and i feel so much love and happy to be here and at the same time i feel um grief i do feel um a little bit of sadness in my heart for um for not knowing when this is going to happen again and in which format and i'm just letting this become music so there are a couple of things that [10306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10306.5s)

we're going to use to talk about are doing is usual but we feel it's helpful i find it's really helpful which is the cycles of life and then so life is better stopped about quite a bit by emmanuel and and vicky and so um we're going to use so the cycles of birth growth of this compost decay event so um and the other the other frame [10331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10331.7s)

we're going to use is the head of hands and so that's the end of the intelligence of the mind so clarity the sediment um cognition and the encounters of the heart connection love uh intelligence of sahara which to me represents most of the current and hence doing actualizing things in the world yeah so we'll just refer back to those [10360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10360.859s)

two models as we go through yep um and hang on just a second there's the online problem they're saying that something that says again music um okay um so the first bit of our journey was our road to rebel me and adriana and then we're going to ask you a bit about yours [10392](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10392.359s)

and this is actually the thing i also want to say about this is in the process of thinking about our rental journey together we also actually processed it together as well so it's like we wouldn't have known this was true until we did it so it's also as we were working our way through this programming so we're also like wow that happened like that like really we were so this is [10413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10413.06s)

this is us before we got here right before we got here this is what was going on and this is me so this is me as a happy game day dude in 2017. this is me getting a nice happy beginning i wanted to like mtv and facebook for real and there was a dress like this haircut and this is me having much less happy um and being like why am i so unhappy like with everything and then this is me [10440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10440.3s)

about 2018 getting existentially questioning in a way that was painful and we had a kind of crumbling process that i didn't understand that was scary now the life actually i was talking to kilo and a few others how common this experience was from people in the sort of five year period or so really not to the rebel encounter and then in 2019 i had a bit [10461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10461.84s)

of a spiritual emergency you could say and uh it actually you know compared noticeable david honestly and we both went through something not at the same time but i think that's a characteristic shared by many people here so as i was interval travel i was sort of in the first afternoon basically what many people were saying is they having their notes right now is [10487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10487.88s)

our midlife crisis or is that spiritual energy we've had a lot of fun putting this together so this is me in hong kong when i lived in hong kong without the philippines and then i had my type of awakening and i have a friend really full into women's mysteries and i work a lot with women and then i felt i was lacking something [10510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10510.5s)

for me so i went into the developmental models and developmental theory and i started working as a coaching facilitator with development and unbeknownst to me i made a little bit of shadow of my feminine work even though i'm an infiltrate bits of the feminine in my developmental model um work i basically was explained by what i saw as the reflect what people [10534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10534.56s)

gave me back for the value that they saw in me i played by that so basically the developmental theory adriana was paid more embedded more whereas the women's mysteries that brianna was fairly higher than other um trusted so i was like i unbeknownst to me i was actually internalizing they may without knowing and then to me just before rebel wisdom which is when we [10560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10560.42s)

sold our house in sydney and we moved into a community where um i had two goats which make last when i um we're talking about a few years ago was behind and um you know and we live in nature and we live in a sustainable house and we and i do so the way i live my life feels deeply in integrity and at the same time i was feeling at the point that i wanted to [10587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10587.479s)

enter i actually i didn't know that i wanted to answer all the ways another question i was walking with is like i'm here here and then these things there happening there and i want to go there how do i go there i want to talk to these people which i don't i didn't know who these people were but there were some people somewhere and i wanted to talk to them so that was that was my [10605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10605.84s)

question and that's when rubble wasn't a kid yeah and um and we came in like this we're gonna turn up with you anyway just to think about where you are at with this process but what we got here interesting we both came through the same door there was all this stuff going on around them we both came in through these videos of daniel and daniel will [10628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10628.04s)

and uh st john's law on a couch talking and just going into flow states when they were dialoguing and they'd blow our minds we were just like what the is that we were like what is that and i'm expecting friends at the time it's like watch this in front of like what what's the big deal i was like no watch and you're like what what are you talking about i was like that's [10649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10649.04s)

important i don't know what it is i don't know what it is and she had the same experience and we're like what is that and it was like this weird siren call that we have to go towards and i was my question was a bit more unrealistic i think than than like what i should live after i die or something like that it was more although i respect that question um it was more like uh i was not working with like what's the song so my son and my soul feels unsung and 50 something and i don't feel like i've sung myself with it what is it and where do i sing it um when i heard that call their conversation between daniel um jimmy leo and jordan hall which i imagine a lot of you have what you know [10689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10689.96s)

and um it was not only where they were speaking from that i was recognizing and but it was actually the choice that david and ellie made to highlight that and to speak um john's language to make salient because to a lot of people it would just be another conversation and the fact that there were some people paying attention to that and thinking it [10713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10713.84s)

was valuable so i was interested in the whole thing i was like are you interested in who's thinking that i'm interested in just having the conversation and i want to have a conversation so that's what brothers blood is in there music so this is the last thing i'm going to say um and then tom is going to take us through a uh ritual i might actually say something during the ritual so that's not exactly what i'm saying but um i was just unpacking the candles um which are going to be part of that and i got to these ones that were like the extra candles i brought and um remembered where they came from and they actually came from the last men's [10754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10754.7s)

weekend we did which was in february on the day of the mega storm which you might remember it was the worst storm that hit britain in like i don't know how many 100 years or something and so all these men um came like literally bursting through the door for like prowling winds and um we uh all the electricity went off in the venue and it turned out that [10779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10779.66s)

everything was connected to this one system the toilets the food like nothing worked so one of our assistants ran out and got like a million candles this is this is one of them um and you know the the retreat went really well but it i was quite touched when i picked it up because that's how we really began david and i really um yes there's an intellectual quality [10802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10802.7s)

to everything we do but the heart of rebelism for me has always been those retreats not because it's around masculinity per se but because of the ways of being that came out of them um and the enormous amount of compassion and love in the room which touched me every time i think we did 10 or 12. it was really beautiful there's some men here in fact two were there [10826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10826.279s)

um quite a few so it's really good to see your faces um and that that energy is what created rebel wisdom that's how we created verbalism from that point and we created something together that was being sort of bigger than both of us and kind of beyond both of us we didn't just create it together it was created by you as well it was created by [10849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10849.56s)

everyone who watched the film everyone you engage in the community everyone who came to our events so i have this kind of question right now which is what what are we laying to rest right now and that's the thing we're laying to rest we're laying to rest something that we all created together david and i are still going to be doing um our utmost to bring these kind of [10873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10873.74s)

ideas and practices into the world i for me i want to bring them mainstream that's really what i want to do i want to take these ideas probably dumb them down somewhat um and really make help be a part of bringing them into the mainstream for me that's my mission right now um and so i'm really curious what everyone wrote on your post-its but everyone here has a purpose has a mission and my real hope is that the thing that doesn't die like i said before is us and our connection and what we can create together this field that we build together so that being said um i want to open the space to close rebel wisdom now [10918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10918.2s)

and it's going to come in a few parts we're going to warm up a bit with tom and then we're going to really put it to rest and have the chance to just say what that is what we want to say through wisdom before it ends and then we're going to celebrate together right so tom well one thing thank you and before tom is your goal i [10939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=10939.62s)

just want to say ali we have cherished david here several times today and we really put our focus on love and attention and appreciation towards him in his absence of being him still being in spirit so i really want to take the moment to bring all that appreciation and attention and love and care uh towards you foreign thank you for being such a brother and holding the space today by yourself and with us thank you hello um oh yeah this works okay good so um you probably read that book about flow by lehigh cheek sent me eyes it's flow is found at the intersection of discipline and surrender and um sometimes i think ali and david as discipline and surround i think they swap parts i say um and i learned this they introduced me to jamie wheel so i thought if i could only flew me to america that worked with his team and flow genome project i thought i'm gonna have to come up with [11053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=11053.26s)

something customized something more impressive than the me high check somebody hi so i said yeah jamie he saw very well but i think flow or the groove is found at the intersection of discipline surrender and mischief and i said i like that so i thought right i'm going to be the mischief guy and i was driving to a gig through the city and the police stopped me [11079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=11079.3s)

and they said you look a bit mischievous and they um i have my drum with me and uh i said no look i've got i'm going to a trade conference i've got a paperwork i've got everything i want a website i said that's all very well but we think you are in leave with extinct from rebellion um and they took me to try and cross police station they locked me up for 12 [11104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=11104.439s)

hours uh on suspicion of about to be a you know about to cause a public nuisance so i thought i didn't get a chance to do it that day so what are we doing now and um they broke my drama look at that look at that and they thought they'd shut me out what they didn't know is so i've got 100 drums [11134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7U1ApSzaM&t=11134.56s)
