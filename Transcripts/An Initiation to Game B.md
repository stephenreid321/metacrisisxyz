what's going on with the world right now? ok. ask another question.  is the world falling apart? keep going.  how did we get here?  .... who's right and who's wrong? .... what's real and what's fake? anything else? what should i do? [54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=54.077s)

these are very good questions. it looks like you are playing game a. would you like to play game~b?   play game~b? yes | no heavy breathing what happened? you have been initiated. 
huh? let's move... we haven't much time. t...time? for what? until the 
parasite takes hold of you again... you're weak but you now have eyes to see. what am i looking at? where am i? like most everyone 
you know, you have been hijacked by a parasite.   the parasite was born of game a. the game you've 
been playing your whole life. it tells you   [139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=139.12s)

how to think, feel and what to do. now that 
you are temporarily free of its influence   we'd like to take you on a journey. a journey? to 
where? a journey to game~b. the journey to game~b   is a story about the relationship between 
humanity, technology and nature. it's a story   not only about survival but the potential 
for thriving. you and your tribe will be   among the first people to play game~b. we 
have traced our steps back to the beginning   just before the dawn of human civilization. 
before game a, there was the first game. the first game was our most 
enduring and successful game   a game we played for over 100 000 
years. our nomadic ancestors stood apart   from their natural cohabitants in 
their special ability to adapt across   all bioregions of the earth. the key to their 
adaptability was culture—a new strategy for group   [215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=215.68s)

cooperation. these early nomadic cultures operated 
within principles of wholeness and regeneration.   the first game was of course multiplayer. each 
player is necessary to sustain the principle   of wholeness by stewarding 
the cycle of regeneration.   all players must be present and respect each 
other's roles. roles? i am the sage who seeks truth   and ensures its transmission to the coming 
generations. my wisdom is that of the mind. i am the chief who seeks to build a 
better world for the coming generations.   my wisdom is that of the body and its extensions.   i am the matriarch who gives life and purpose to 
the coming generations. my wisdom is that of the   heart. which... role am i? as a game~b pioneer, 
you must do what is yours to do and bring   together all of the necessary roles to sustain 
the principles of wholeness and regeneration. [294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=294.48s)

auraaaaaaaaaaaoohh! nuhuh... aaaahhhh! the parasite! it's waking up... we 
have to hurry. you mustn't allow    the creature to take hold. breathe deeply 
and keep your wisdom centers open. come. nature's abundance functions in a 
constant state of regenerative motion.   this is wholeness. as stewards, all players in 
the human tribe must move with nature's cycles   as our nomadic ancestors once 
did. here, take this talisman.   in the first game, cooperation was the rule within 
each tribe. by utilizing the co-creative strategy   of culture, each player felt a sense of membership 
and belonging in their tribe. all tribes were   indigenous to a specific place on earth—our 
bioregions—like here, along the cascade range.   [369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=369.2s)

each tribe grew niches around the habitats 
available to it. this is true for all living beings.   shelters, tools, weapons, clothing and medicines— 
all made from resources that were immediately   available to them and skillfully constructed 
with knowledge of the local plants and animals.   although neighboring tribes were regarded 
as dangerous, the most resilient of tribes   traded goods and knowledge in patterns 
of both cooperation and competition. for a long time the number of tribes 
across all bioregions innately respected   the principle of wholeness so they stayed 
in a hush but steady balance with nature.   but even nature's bounty has her limits. over 
time, the first game became so successful,   the number and size of tribes grew large 
forcing us into close proximity with one another.   once we were no longer free to roam, we had no 
choice but to settle in place and competition   [438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=438.96s)

intensified for nature's bounty. 
a new game emerged. game a. where are we now? or, when? here we stand before 
the cradle of civilization at the birth of game   a. as competition increased, the tribe began to lose 
its instinctual ability to sustain the principles   of wholeness and regeneration. game a is the game 
of growth, rivalry, control and accumulation. human   settlement meant the accumulation and control 
of resources, knowledge and people. the race to   accumulate and control accelerated faster 
and faster and competition began to dominate   cooperation. though necessary to advance the 
human tribe, game a would prove to be fragile. even the players that depended on each 
other began to compete with one another.   the players assumed control and dominion over 
nature's land and her bounty—and over each other.   before long, culture would be divided into rigid 
class structures and those with the greatest   [528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=528.4s)

accumulation sat at the top of an exclusive 
hierarchy. what we do to nature, we do to ourselves.   the strategy of culture itself underwent diverse 
adaptation as empires competed for more and more   accumulation and control—and killed off those 
who couldn't or wouldn't play the new game.   in our race to master game a, nature's stewardship 
was lost. because game a's technology takes from   nature without bothering to give back, it is 
fundamentally exploitative. the strategy of   rivalry and accumulation led to the exponential 
development of complicated technologies.   since these technologies require extraction from 
the geosphere, eventually they become lethal to   the biosphere. as the game continues to advance, 
our global ecosystems are collapsing—all the   while our technologies are gaining the potential 
for destruction & depletion on a vast scale. compared to the first game however, game a is young— 
and its players are novice. when the principles of   [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=613.04s)

wholeness &regeneration are abandoned, there 
is only one fate. self-termination. indeed all   empires since the beginning of game a have risen 
only to later be forced into disintegration.   the pattern is clear now. we must play a new 
game if we are to survive and thrive. game~b. does that mean going back to the first 
game? no. the only way out is through.   it is very important that we must 
take what we have learned from game a   then once again move to sustain the 
principles of wholeness and regeneration.   the parasite you carry with you is an object of 
control and blind adherence to the rules of game a. it was set upon you in your earliest years. the 
parasite makes sure that you conform to game a   by conditioning you to view yourself as separate 
from nature and from other people—so that you   forget the principle of wholeness and your purpose 
as a steward of the earth. the parasite knows only   [690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=690.16s)

one god. the modern growth-based economy. 
but you can free yourself from its grasp.   how? by starting with what you did at the outset 
of this journey. asking more questions than   trying to provide answers will open your mind. by 
first finding what is yours to do then building   meaningful relationships with those whom you need 
to work with. this will open your heart. and finally   by acting and creating from a place of integrity 
within your tribe. this will train your body to   play game~b. the more you keep these wisdom 
centers open and sustain the principle of   wholeness within yourself, your tribe and the world, 
the less the parasite will have influence over you. woah... is this game~b? the story of game~b is not yet 
written nor guaranteed—but its potential is real.   now more than ever—the world needs our creativity 
and stewardship to create the conditions for life   to thrive. the challenges that face humanity are 
far too complex for one person or tribe to fathom.   [788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=788.32s)

the crises we see: ecological, political, social 
and educational are interconnected. to face this   meta-crisis, we must consciously revitalize 
our tribe's special ability to adapt quickly   with the co-creative strategy of culture—and 
we must do so in a bioregional mesh network   across the globe. restoring this 
co-creative engine to the human tribe   will once again allow cooperation to out-compete 
competition—leading to an exodus out of game a. therefore, by the rules of game~b, the 
meta-crisis cannot be solved by a single   tribe or ideology. the key is to expand our 
inter-tribal cooperation to the global scale   and for this we will need open and 
decentralized access to our game a technologies along with a culture rejuvenated by 
wholeness. nature creates humans, humans   create technology and technology must be used to 
support the integrity of nature. game a's strategy   [863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=863.6s)

of driving rivalrous innovation and production 
while continuing extraction must come to an end.   at the heart of this co-creative strategy of 
culture is a space to rediscover each other   and our relationship with nature. as we learn about 
our role as stewards, we will revive the principles   of wholeness and regeneration. like our own bodies, 
the game~b tribe must protect the heart. we start   by acting locally while thinking globally. like our 
nomadic ancestors, our economies become bioregional   —this time however they are interconnected by a 
global mesh with the assistance of our technology.   tribe selection is the driving force of human 
evolution. what will distinguish us from our   nomadic ancestors is our cooperation on all scales 
from the individual player, to the neighborhood,   to the village, to the tribe, to the city, 
to the bioregion, to the globe and someday   across the galaxy. like the fungal networks 
beneath our feet, a rich system of channels   [954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs&t=954.24s)

for cooperation and movement will enable us 
to respond to the global challenges we face. the work required to achieve this vision is 
today—incomprehensible. but it is time to play.   every day you must return to the symbol of 
wholeness to loosen the parasite's grasp.   by keeping your wisdom centers open, you can let go 
of your conditioned ways of being. lead with your   strengths and find others who are committed to do 
the same. make sure that your tribe has strengths   in all three forms of wisdom and that you respect 
each other's roles. then, and only then, can you   start to play game~b. there is a future of thriving 
that awaits us. it would be a shame to miss it. grrrrrroooooohhhhhuuuugghhh... gamebfilm.org
