we can also get in a trap when we start to think about purpose in terms of doing exclusively and so very commonly people think what is the purpose of my life and they think that there is an answer in words that relates to something that they are going to do so i'm going to end extreme poverty or prevent ai catastrophe or whatever it is and of course if that one doing is their purpose then every opportunity to relieve suffering or add beauty other than that isn't part of their purpose welcome to 2050 the no fluff podcast now the big picture positive impact and life purpose this podcast inspires you to think big create your life purpose and make it happen my name is max ak and for this episode i spoke to daniel marton berger daniel marton berger is a systems thinker and [56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=56.76s)

thought leader he's director of research and development and a co-founder at the mirror hacker collective where he's focused on developing processes and technologies for advancing medicine and human optimization this episode is a bit longer than usual but well worth it daniel dives deep into the meaning and different dimensions of life purpose and shares his big-picture view on [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=84.299s)

civilization and the trajectory of the world hi daniel thank you for joining the 2050 podcast hey max i'm happy to be here thanks for having me daniel what is your life purpose i think i'll start with sharing a little bit about how i think about that question the arc of how i've thought about that question in my life which is probably going to be more relevant for people than what my [118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=118.11s)

particular answer to the question happens to be as valuable as a question as it is it's also a problematic one can be a problematic one so a kid i didn't feel like i could actually make any choice without knowing that because i didn't have the context so the most trivial choices of what to study or who to play with or what to pay attention to like well what is the what [149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=149.52s)

is the ordinate us for choice for me what is it that i am making choices towards and why and so i needed to have a sense of the purpose of my life to have a sense of the purpose of any decision to have a sense of a basis to choose and then to have a sense of the purpose of my life i felt like i needed a sense of the purpose of life writ large to know what my life what the [170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=170.61s)

embedding function that my life was within and that usually looked like what is the purpose of human life within the whole and then even larger what about life a thing we call biologic life and then even deeper what is the purpose of reality at all of something rather than nothing and then of course we realized that even the question purpose imports a whole bunch of concepts that may or may [195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=195.42s)

not be the right ones it purpose is an inherently utilitarian concept and so do i want to be asking what the purpose is do i want to be asking what the inherent value of life is what would i or what i value do i won't ask what the meaningfulness and the basis for meaningfulness is do i want to ask what the nature of it is so these are all non sentence and all deep in terms of value [219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=219.93s)

meaning purpose and all deep questions and important ones we can also get in a trap when we start to think about purpose in terms of doing exclusively and so very commonly people think what is the purpose of my life and they think that there is an answer in words that relates to something that they're going to do so i'm going to end extreme poverty or prevent ai catastrophe or whatever it is and of course if that one doing is their purpose then every opportunity to relieve suffering or add beauty other than that isn't part of their purpose and that means the presence being present with and loving their family members isn't their purpose being present with opportunities that present themselves that they could contribute to the piece of trash they [272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=272.49s)

walk by on the street and so we start to realize that one of the other challenges is as soon as i define it then the outside nough something that is meaningful outside of that has been excluded from my sons of purpose right so then we start to say well there what is the purpose of my life not just at a doing level but at a being level that all of the doing relates to and [295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=295.92s)

obviously my best understanding of this now might also be quite different than my best understanding of it in the future so is is there is there an [[evolutionary process]] for how i think about this so with all that as preface i'm obviously not going to address the question comprehensively on this short conversation so i'll speak to a few things that are probably underneath a [325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=325.74s)

question i'll say a little bit more about and i'm gonna hold them as synonyms for now because the distinctions take more work philosophically and most people hold the missing items so the purpose or the meaningfulness of life from a being and a doing and a becoming perspective i'll just say a little bit about this and how they fit together we can say that living [353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=353.13s)

a good life living a meaningful purposeful life has different elements to it and so i'm gonna offer a little model here where there are at least that will there are not at least there are three elements to living a meaningful life that are distinct but all necessary so we can talk about the being mode in which one way of defining it is the purpose of life there is a to appreciate [385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=385.86s)

the beauty of existence as deeply as i can to take it in to be moved by it to experience at a depth that the purposefulness and the value of a piece of art requires it being appreciated there's the relationship between subject and object that is neither subject nor object but but that triplicate the relationship where the meaningfulness [409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=409.86s)

comes and so when i am taking in the beauty of reality reality is becoming more meaningful and the deeper that i'm taking it in right so we can think about purpose from the being point of view as being about endeavoring to be more present to reality as it is all the time and when we start to think about doing we can say that doing is about adding to the beauty of reality acting in ways [441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=441.0s)

that change reality with the hope with the intent to add to the beauty of it in ways that will increase the potential for the experience of beauty for others right there will effect the beat of others when i think about becoming i think about evolving my capacity for being in doing increasing my capacity to both appreciate and add to the beauty of life and so i get that being doing and [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=468.57s)

becoming are all meaningful and they're all meaningful only in relationship to each other the doing adding to the beauty of life that's all anyone did and no one actually appreciated it would ultimately be baseless etc right so we can see how those are those are bound concepts we can think about the being as related to our relationship to reality on the perceptual side and doing on the [501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=501.12s)

expressive side we can see the whole thing as our relationship to life with a capital l or reality with a capital r and so then you know i just speak about it again in a broad way i can say my purpose is going to be expressed each moment in terms of how much presence and love and integrity i can show to life and whatever aspect of life happens to be in front of me each moment [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=537.98s)

and across the arc of my life and so if i have an idea about what i should be doing that actually makes me less present with what's in front of me and less available to appreciate and serve what's in front of me that can be a problem now not just the moments of life but also the arc of life i want to see how full is my relationship with reality moment by [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=566.0s)

moment and also across the whole arc of my life how relevant was it to what was needed for the whole of life during that time so these are all interesting and i think generally applicable considerations for everyone if we want to talk about the doing side for me as a specific person well it's different in this particular time in the world than it would have been in the past or in the [599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=599.81s)

future because different things are needed and i have different capabilities than i would have had in those developmental environments etc and obviously it's different here than if i was growing up in the peruvian rainforest and so what mine is is not going to be what anyone else's is in that way right so it's there are generalized things which we spoke about [620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=620.329s)

and then there's also the unique expression of those generalized things so having the orientation to think about systems and [[complex system|complex systems]] that my life brought that orientation to me and various other capacities orientations doing what i can to help transition civilization from being on a path that is currently [[self-terminating]] to a path that is not [[self-terminating]] and that is as supportive of the possibility of purpose and meaning for everyone enduringly into the future and working on changing the underlying structural dynamics that help make that possible is what we could say my main sense of purpose that are doing level is so if you think about your you're doing level do you have goals for the year 2050 of what do you want to change in the world [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=695.92s)

by then so 2050 is just over 30 years from now what i would like to see different in the world by them is first i think it weren't saying that there are [[existential risk|existential risks]] risks of us continuing to exist or not that could play out in less time than that so it is not a given currently that we make it to 2050 this is an important part of framing that question there are other [[existential risk|existential risks]] and catastrophic not necessary fully existential but civilization collapse type risks that even there are some that could actually play out in that time there are other ones that might not play out in that time but we pass critical tipping points where they will inevitably play out after that time during that time so one thing by 2050 is i want us to not have experienced [762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=762.68s)

civilization collapse or [[existential risk]] and i also want us to not have past tipping points that are irreversible towards catastrophic or [[existential risk]] and to speak even more broadly than i would say i want by 2050 that we that there is a change in the vector and change in the overall trajectory of the path that civilization is on from one that is heading [799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=799.279s)

towards many different self-determination scenarios where they were talking about the a hundred different versions of ai apocalypse or we're talking about world war three or we're talking about [[climate change]] induced human migration issues that lead to resource wars or we're talking about collapse of biodiversity peak nitrogen peak phosphorus [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean etc or killer drones or the gazillion different scenarios we have we have a civilization that is generating all those scenarios at increasing speed in magnitude switching off of that path onto a path that is developing all of its technological capacity for omni positive purposes is what i want to see in the world writ large now if i want to speak to some pretty specific things [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=854.23s)

that people could see by 2050 i would want to see a i do want to see a prototype of a new model of civilization a full-stack new civilization model that has in its design categorically solved the [[generator function]] of all of the catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] and is a civilization model that is not only not moving in the direction of self-determination but is one that moves [889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=889.75s)

in the direction of increasing quality of life and is actually more adaptive than the current civilization so it becomes a new gravitational basin for everything to flow and so who specifically this requires new economics new governance new law new jurisprudence and philosophy as a basis of law new judicial new medicine new you know all those systems new infrastructure and new [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=919.809s)

technology development processes and new culture and sense of what is meaningful purposeful etc that the system is or orienting towards and all of those intersect each other so we're talking about a full-stack reboot from an axiom level and when we think about all of the risks the [[existential risk|existential risks]] currently and we say what do they have in common that is [947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=947.57s)

driving all of them we see things like well if we have a rival risk game meaning win lose games in-group out-group team dynamics that are competing in in where they cannot both win then harm definitely happens from that right i my win requires your loss oh i'm seeking army directly and we're both trying to extract more resource from the environment or external ism or [976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=976.13s)

harm to the environment or indirectly doing that through the harm that happens through war or whatever so we're harming each other and harming the commons with exponential technology which means exponentially increased capacity to affect the world through our choices then to the degree we're making choices that are directly and or indirectly harm causing exponential harm causing choices [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1000.43s)

self-terminate on a finite playing field and so for the for thousands of years of the thing we've called civilization we have killed people who had different ideas than us as a reasonable way to deal with problems and we have had unsustainable agriculture that desertified areas that were previously non desert i mean that's not a new phenomena the certification is a [1026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1026.919s)

thousands of years old phenomena we've extincted species for a long time so we're not talking about the [[existential risk]] that many faces now are not different in kind they're different in magnitude and speed so solving those so we say ok so [[exponential tech]] which is the fact that we have tech that makes it easier to make better tech computers that help us make better computers right [1054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1054.04s)

[[exponential tech]] can't be put back in the bag that's going to keep happening but exponential tekmoto rival risk [[game theory]] self terminates therefore we have to create ante environments that make us safe stewards of the level of power that exponential technology brings or the human experiment completes in a in a mythopoetic sense we can say as [1079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1079.71s)

exponential technology is bringing us to have the power of gods we have to have the love and wisdom and prudence of gods to guide the use of that power or irresponsible use of that power will end up self-destructing and so what does you know what does that look like so when we talk about solving the [[generator function]] there - anti rivalries games that doesn't just be creating an anti [1108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1108.039s)

rival risk environment obviously requires changing macroeconomics because my balance sheet is the scorecard of a finite rivalry scheme it requires not having n group out groups like nations those things become obsolete or religions or race identifications in any deep kind of sentence right away these are deep changes it requires not having things like democracy where we make a [1130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1130.96s)

proposition that is ill-formed or if the proposition goes through it benefits something and harm something else and if it doesn't go through then something else is protected and something else is harmed as opposed to had it went through which will always lead to groups of people based on which of the needs that they have more cluster around one side versus the other which now creates [1148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1148.419s)

polarization and eventually radicalization which then eventually has to be stabilized in war but wars that we can't keep having with exponentially increasing military tech that become actually unwinnable so solve creating an anti rivalry environment is a non-trivial thing it says kind of thing humanity's never done but we have to do something we've never done because every [1171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1171.34s)

civilization that we've ever had so far has all collapsed and but now we have a fully global civilization where the collapse is actually catastrophic and so when rome fell it was a lot but it wasn't the whole world right when the mayans fell the inca fell mesopotamia sumeria any of those they wasn't everything now we have a fully globalized [[supply chain]] economy that is also connected to the biosphere in such deep ways that collapse is really a chemistry claps so given that the systems always failed for these reasons we have to do something that the world has never done before we also though have increased capacities that the world has never had and we have to realize them to guide the other capacities that are coming onboard [1213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1213.21s)

so the reason i'm saying all this is because creating an anti reverse environment doesn't only prevent x risk it also changes the underlying basis of what has sucked about humans for the whole history of humans the those rivalry spaces are why we have fought wars and tortured and hurt the environment and etc and we've made whole philosophies around the nature of [1238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1238.29s)

duality and the mixed bag bag that humans are that are really just based on the game theoretic environment we've been in we can create a different environment that doesn't incentivize write harm because as long as as long as i am incentivized to do something that is harmful to you it can't be prevented at scale but we can actually change that underlying incentive and make it to [1262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1262.2s)

where your well-being and mine are more tightly coupled and yours mine and the commons are more tightly coupled it's not communism or socialism or anything that has ever been presented it's totally new that again is outside of the scope of what we can talk about today but we can you know people are interested when you talk about some time there actually are very real paths for [1282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1282.18s)

how to do this but in the process of create solving the [[generator function]] so that one that i mentioned is one there are other ones solving the [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[catastrophic risk]] we're also solving the basis of the historical human sock dynamics and bringing about a really radically different humanity and so you know if we have an intentional community [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1310.8s)

today that is trying to prototype some ideals but they still to get the computer that we're talking on have to buy it from apple which has to get minerals that came from conflict zones and rain forests over six continents and was made in factories where there are nets on the windows so the workers don't commit suicide because the conditions are so shitty and [1331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1331.86s)

then our lovely village is still being supported by the tragedy of the whole rest of the thing right so until we can actually get a high-tech closed-loop civilization that does not require import that is actually more adaptive in the previous civilization we haven't yet shown we can do that thing that happens at the scale of a high-tech city-state city-state meaning it has to be [1358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1358.17s)

sovereign in law city meaning that's the minimum kind of scale of self-organization that could actually produce all the ton needs so by 2050 i want to see a fully operating city-state new civilization model that is anti rival risks that has the right relationship between complicated and [[complex system|complex systems]] all the other dynamics that we need and i want to see that [1383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1383.44s)

having men operating long enough and well enough that the rest of the world is already starting to move in the direction that it is setting an example of and that means also off of the ex risk path so if you think about the 2050 the full-stack prototype of the the city of the new civilization model maybe you can give us like a brief overview of how are you going to make that happen like [1420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1420.04s)

what are you working on right now to move civilization in that direction well what i'm working on right now with a number of other people that are endeavoring similarly is what we started with is really inventory all of those risks in areas catastrophic [[existential risk|existential risks]] and then looking at what the common [[generator function|generator functions]] is drive all of them are at a deep level and then [1451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1451.15s)

looking at what would a categorical solution to that [[generator function]] be because whether i'm talking about the depletion of phosphorous or the depletion of nitrogen or the depletion of fish or the depletion of old-growth forests or the depletion of topsoil those are all the police dynamics that are driven by certain things whether i'm talking about [1468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1468.19s)

the excess of co2 or the excess of nitrogen runoff in [[dead zone|dead zones]] or the excess of mercury in the air or the excess all those toxicity dynamics those have something in common whether i'm talking about this type of war scenario or that type of war scenario or is type of terrorism scenario they all have certain types of things in common we can go to deeper levels of assessment as to [1486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1486.16s)

what the [[generator function|generator functions]] are and then say if i try to solve one of these but all the other ones are still on course at most i maybe move the curve of like giving us a few more months you know maybe a couple more years unless the one i'm doing wasn't actually the first one that hit so much case it was kind of worthless so given that the [[generator function|generator functions]] have so many different expressions unless we solve them at that level we we don't really move we don't really change the future possibility state that much so we've been looking at being able to articulate the [[generator function|generator functions]] in ways that we can show our complete meaning that solutions there are not only necessary for civilization making it but also sufficient and then actually developing [1532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1532.63s)

architectures for viable solutions to those which means how how would an [[economic system]] a governance system a legal system and infrastructural system etc work that didn't do those things right that generated fundamentally different types of behaviour so we've been been working basically on this level of understanding the nature of the problem well enough and then being able [1560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1560.08s)

to characterize design criteria of a solution and then starting to develop actual instantiations of solutions that meet those design criteria next is starting to prototype then starting to prototype governance methods we've developed to see that they do what we think they will and we'll find them and then you know before we can build a city state since it has an [[economic system]] that isn't any [[economic system]] that's ever been there's nobody trained and the things that they will need to be trained for how to administer it since it would have a governance system etc the politicians and lawyers and judges and bankers of the world would have nothing to do in that world and the corresponding functions don't yet exist fever into their that [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1605.059s)

people aren't trained on them so there's a whole new civics right there's a whole new set of stuff that people have to be trained there's a whole new process to technology design for how to do technology that doesn't cause toxicity issues as you know an externality so that means that we have to have a lot of people working on components of it and getting trained in those components who [1626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1626.87s)

will then be able to help build the city state scale and populate it you know to begin with and that is it it's deep enough training that lettle have to happen in immersive environments which means communities villages you know places where people are actually together working on training in these new skills and capacities that will then be able to boot and those will be not [1655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1655.94s)

closed-loop they'll still require getting on a boeing to fly somewhere and buying a computer from apple but but they will be developing some of the capacities necessary to build a civilization with that along the curve so we're working on kind of as best as we can the full articulation and description of the design criteria that are necessary so that other people can [1681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1681.799s)

can play with those ideas also and see if those design criteria makes sense to them if they agree with our analysis and then also work on those things independently and then start to work on instantiate and then evolving the scale of them towards full-scale prototype and then you know spread of that prototype that prototype has to be not only right in kind meaning that it is solved the [1710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1710.33s)

[[generator function|generator functions]] but it also has to be anti fragile in the presence of the fact that the rest of the world was still rival risk and this is a new system and it also has to be out of poetic meaning it has to be able to make expand and propagate itself so those are all parts of the design criteria so those are those are some of the things that i'm working on now towards those [1734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1734.07s)

goals so if listeners want to support you in your mission in your purpose how can people help you mmm thank you for that i don't know since i don't know what skills and aptitudes and passions and resources they have one thing i would say is it all needs done right it it all needs done so the if someone currently is working on trying to solve coral reef issues or carbon [1787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1787.44s)

sequestration issues or a i risk issues whatever and they have a path to make meaningful progress there keep doing that our chance of doing what we're doing depends on assuming that lots of people are trying to do lots of important things right so knowing that we're working on the same project at a meta level the re trajectory of civilization [1814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1814.68s)

to a better trajectory that's one thing i would say wow those big projects are happening that children still need raised and old people need taken care of and food needs grown and all those things and if you're doing those things do them all so with full presence integrity love realizing that they're critical and if those are the things for you to be doing as far as the specific [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1843.96s)

projects we're working on go to my blog and read the stuff and see if it can you know it's compelling i've only written the tiniest little bit of stuff on there i have a few podcasts cuz most we've been focused on kind of a research and thinking about it more than sharing it just for a share time reason but getting more educated as a valuable part of it you can do a lot more that is [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1871.98s)

relevant if you understand the nature of the [[problem space]] in the solution space better and so in addition to my blog there's a number of good resources some of which i have linked on my blog to to study and you know already right now and over the next period we there's a lot of research we need to do there's stuff that we need to write this piece of media to develop there are so people who [1899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1899.669s)

have those skills people who have funds that could support people who have those skills all of that is relevant so if if you feel called send me a message great daniel thank you so much that was yeah really really fascinating like hi macro overview of the world from your perspective and i really appreciate appreciate you joining the 2050 podcast i appreciate being on and i appreciate [1929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhrr-fJCTWY&t=1929.61s)
