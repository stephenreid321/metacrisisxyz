how do we let go of the certainty that we know what the right answer is but we also let go of the certainty there is no answer and we're we orient towards faithfulness that answers might exist and they take working towards and then we commit to the discipline and rigor to be part of figuring that out and knowing that we can't do all of it the discipline and rigor of evolving ourselves to work well with other people that are also doing it so that [[collective intelligence]] of groups of people working to do that can enact solutions that is like the discipline of a people that want to be able to reinstate governance of foreign by the people collective insights as a voyage through [39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=39.62s)

topics and technologies revolutionizing human well-being groundbreaking approaches for a better world and a better life await you welcome to collective insights well welcome to the next edition of homegrown humans with neuro hacker collective and i this is a very full circle kind of conversation get to speak with a dear friend and colleague and [63](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=63.719s)

fellow instigator of all things future facing daniel schmachtenberger one of the founders of the consilience project and organization dedicated to improving the world's information ecology and bettering our collective [[decision making]] so that we can forge futures that we all want to live into as well as part of the founding team of neuro hacker collective itself and a generally all-around [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=89.1s)

thoughtful and good guy so daniel schmachtenberger welcome to homegrown humans it's good to see you going to be talking with you jamie it is a fun full circle thing given that um first instantiation of this podcast ever i was hosting five years ago or something like that and then heather did and uh and then we started to grow it and yeah it's [114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=114.6s)

cool it's cool to be here talking with you absolutely well listen there's an infinite number of directions that we can go but one of the ones when i kind of just busted out my notebook that came to you know left off my pen first was just curiosity on your sense of how you know the kind of quote unquote the conversation and by that i would say we [138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=138.66s)

can refine it to all things um tending towards both [[existential risk]] future studies positive interventions at any level of the human cultural stack that we're playing with um what's your sense as we're not really out of the whole govid woods but everyone's just playing through at this [163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=163.68s)

point so we're kind of it feels like we are somewhat on the other side of two and a half years of quarantine and i'm just curious um maybe you know if you've got a if you've got an answer or we can just explore this out loud is what feels like it is shifted or changed what have you noticed from say where we were in [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=185.16s)

january whatever it was was it 2020 that we went into lockdown is that right so we went in like february or march right so what going into that wood chipper of existence um what's changed or shifted because obviously there's been so much and i think we've probably already started forgetting um the layers as they've come in but [207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=207.239s)

what are you tracking that is different now in the summer of 22 than when we were all sort of caught unawares with a two-week lockdown in late february of 2020. within these kind of you know this conversation and and our friends our colleagues um and just what what you're sensing and the kind of zeitgeist of the space it's an interesting question because the [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=236.22s)

the initial frame of what things are in the conversation it it actually seems like a pretty small number of people that think about [[existential risk]] and all things positive um and state of the world as a whole like as a single conversation um i would say the biggest changes that [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=261.979s)

i've seen in terms of people's sense of like maybe what that conversation has in common is people who are thinking about uh humanity in the world globally what are the major issues that we face rather than in a specific sector or by a specific nation or to a specific you know audience of people but what are the things humanity faces globally and what are the ways of [287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=287.94s)

addressing those that might be adequate or meaningful and how do those global issues contextualize other things that might be meaningful um i would say covid but even before covid the trump election i noticed a launch shift in my conversation publicly but also in my [311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=311.4s)

conversation with a lot of institutional heads whether like academic government big business whatever in their sense of there are problems but there have always been problems this is kind of business as usual to the sense that oh no we're actually entering a kind of different phase where pax americana and the post-world war ii world seems to be um shifting radically it seems like the [336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=336.72s)

degree of bipartisan like venom and polarization associated with the trump election had a lot of people who had before that still been arguing their problems but the country works fundamentally fine it works better than any other country to like oh maybe there's actually an [[existential risk]] to democracy itself maybe you know maybe uh [[social media]] technology really did break the [[fourth estate]] in a way that breaks to democracy but is fine for autocracy i i started noticing much more serious consideration regarding like the fundamental viability of these [[social system|social systems]] that we've depended upon liberal democracy and things like that and then the so much of australia coming on fire and then everybody's forgetting that because of covid when that was like the biggest thing ever and then the secondary shocks of cobit from the [[supply chain]] effects to the economic effects to the that and then i think definitely january 6th and um all of the uh george floyd related [403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=403.86s)

protests and um that suite of things seems to have made the small group of people that saw that these current world systems were untenable and kind of unwinding made that pretty popularly um if not believed at least something that a lot of people were sensitive to and [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=426.3s)

particularly the people who have been in the running the institution's position that is what i find very interesting so what i've found is that i've had way more people asking about things like how do we fundamentally redesign our political economy how do we how do we build a world where democracy is viable [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=447.18s)

in a post [[social media]] and pretty soon post deep fake world like and asking in even getting a little bit more future oriented what does the future of economy and education and everything in a post-technological automation world look like it's those are questions now that um there are very few people in institutional positions not kind of [470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=470.759s)

interested in and there were very few very interested in them before yeah that reminds me of uh that university of chicago philosopher jonathan leah who wrote that book radical hope and i i reference him at the end of recapture the rapture but he said you know the the inability of a civilization to conceive of its own demise is one of the blind [492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=492.599s)

spots of any culture and it does feel it's with fm tracking what you're saying you're sort of suggesting that 2016 through now including both the political disruptions there brexit trump you know gen 6 but also these psychosocial governmental policy everything of quarantine um has just massively stretched the overton window as to what quote unquote mainstream or or polite opinion is willing to entertain at this point yeah totally and you know i know our friend uh nate higgins is just out with you and like they're there are some things that are still really far outside the overton window of thinking about adequate solutions to um and so when when you it i'll just take his as an example because maybe people here are familiar um one of the things that he looks at very deeply is that the gdp of the world the total size of the global economy is pegged very tightly to the total amount of energy used which makes sense right [553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=553.019s)

whether you're any good or service was going to require some energy so it's kind of tightly pegged we say well what about efficiency shouldn't we get more dollars per joule of energy with efficiency yeah but at a smaller rate of changes in efficiency then the rate of increased demand of energy from the increased demand in finance and those efficiencies lead to using more energy [571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=571.38s)

is that javen's paradox devin's paradox anytime you get an increase in efficiency of energy you use more energy because when energy becomes a little bit cheaper you get new markets that open up and um and the energy return on energy investment needed to get us off oil means you've got to use a lot of oil and [590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=590.94s)

coal to make those solar panels it's going to take them 10 years or however long to make enough energy to pay off the energy it took it just doesn't converge and so then we say okay well this is like a key insight is that somewhere around 2019 we started getting very clear diminishing returns on hydrocarbon investment meaning it takes more barrels of oil to get a new barrel [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=609.72s)

of oil it's not specifically like toss ends and fracking and all the diminishing returns on those original bonanzas exactly and so if we're in a place where we can get more oil but we're getting lower energy return on energy investment which is going to continue to happen while having a need for an exponential amount more money for the financial system to keep up with its [628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=628.62s)

own interest and the money in the oil are correlated that thing doesn't get to keep going and so then there's a reckoning in where like the price of oil has all the externalities caught it in the environment we're not making more hydrocarbons of that type and we're not dealing with all the waste of which [[climate change]] is one of the waste streams but not the only one obviously oil spills and mountaintop removal mining for coal and everything so if you were to say what would it cost to pay for oil with real costs right where we could sustainably keep doing this forever we're not actually net harming the environment depending upon which way you analyze it it's 10 000 plus dollars per barrel of oil [666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=666.779s)

and that makes it so wait that's a that's an interesting data point so you're just saying if you actually priced in both cost of acquisition restoration distribution pure refinement and distribution then you and then and then all sort of carbon offsets that would be required to do this in in a sustaining way then you're at 10k a barrel 10k to a million depending upon [689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=689.88s)

how you factor all of the life cycle analysis okay and so what that means is that the cost of my shoes and the cost of the computer we're talking on and everything just became like the entire market of everything broke yeah so you basically buy a hat a pair of shoes and you get them resold indefinitely a pair of really good shoes [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=712.2s)

it changes purchasing decisions what and the computer we're talking on that rather than being a two or three thousand dollar apple might be like a million dollar apple if you factor the real cost of what it takes to for the [[supply chain|supply chains]] to make this thing and then you're like okay we would actually not even do manufacturing the same way we only do manufacturing this [736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=736.14s)

way because we've been able to externalize all the costs to the environment now we're hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] we're not going to be able to keep doing that if we were going to internalize the costs we we didn't externalize like half the cost we internalized like four orders of magnitude more of the costs than we internalized [753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=753.12s)

and so nobody is thinking seriously enough about what the does an economy that does not externalize costs look like and how do we retool our total global infrastructure in that way and how do we do it in the time we have factoring that we're already in diminishing returns on hydrocarbons and everything is oriented towards growth and you have to [775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=775.62s)

completely change the financial system and so i would say at least conversations like that are there are more people listening to them and bothered by it that doesn't mean there's anything like a transition plan on those things that is starting to get realistic yeah we actually one of the fellows who attended our camp was actually a really [797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=797.76s)

good-hearted dc policy analyst and his partner is tibetan origin she's working deeply in the house and the senate as well so they're way into the policy side of things but interestingly had kind of you know come that you know familiar with your work as well familiar with nate that kind of thing and it was just very interesting to kind of hear their sort of inside baseball on how the [816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=816.18s)

policies like do you if people knew that this was all just overworked ivy league early 20-something a congressional aides that are fundamentally moving this all through the system people will be shocked and horrified um but i'll tell you what i want there's so much you've just done you know you've just teed up here i want to this is probably one of the main threads of the [835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=835.38s)

conversation but before we jump into it i just kind of want to also ask you about the other side and and i'll play my card first which is i have noticed a staggering number of people in the last two years get sucked down conspiratorial rabbit holes and people like other thought otherwise thought were sane and grounded are now in the tank for one particular you know reality tunnel [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=854.12s)

conspiracy theory or another including otherwise fairly centrist public thinkers etc et cetera so whether that is convinced of some grand davos led great reset conspiracy bundling in vaccine concerns bundling in the deep hermeneutics of suspicion sort of all round and and sort of therefore veering precariously too dangerously to irresponsibly into some form of [885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=885.12s)

accelerationism meaning let's hurry up and get this thing over let's help start tearing it down because the big time baddies are out to get us so first let's just talk about that what what have you been noticing because i mean i've been shocked you know about how just divergence among friends and colleagues that i would normally even while we have a variety of [907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=907.56s)

different political you know philosophical perspectives i always took them as sort of good faith representatives of their stand and now you know and we know some you know some filmmakers documentarians right that there's a whole swath of these folks podcasters you know um what what is your sense of that because it's one thing to say at the bottom of [930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=930.0s)

the barrel of reddit and hn and telegram you've got some kooky folks saying some wacky ass things but it feels like that has bubbled up and has now been capturing a staggering number of otherwise what i would have thought of as reliable independent thinkers what's your take on that first of all are you experiencing and if so do you have any sense of mechanism [955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=955.019s)

yeah there's a lot in there and it is true um there was obviously already a trend that had been strengthening for some time since like post vietnam on increased left right polarization and also increased kind of pro versus anti-institutional um or pro-standard model anti-standard [975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=975.54s)

model orientation obviously we saw this pick up heavily with [[social media]] because of the nature of how [[social media]] works and then um but in this time frame we saw it pick up a lot and i would say you know the leading up to the trump election post and then covid definitely but i wouldn't i don't think the way i would say it is there's a lot more people [996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=996.24s)

that are conspiratorial because that's part of it but there's also more like interestingly blinded standard model support simultaneously so that's a mouthful so unpack that um for every like the whole instant zeitgeist washing on it's not a lab leak it couldn't have been a lab [1023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1023.36s)

leak the science has settled if you think that it could have been a lab leak or engage the hypothesis you're doing some weird kind of xenophobic conspiracy theory that was a really radical push in the zeitgeist that was not founded the science was not settled it was a totally reasonable hypothesis whether it was true or not it [1043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1043.22s)

was absofucking lutely something that needed to be explored because if you just have that big of an effect on the world of course if i can explore all those things and if we're doing gain of research and synthetic bio technology and we had an instant somewhere we might have more of those instances so it should absolutely be a totally realistic conversation and the suppression on the [1063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1063.02s)

conversation um and the like there was a that's what i would call there was like a standard model narrative and there were more smart people that bought the standard model narrative without realizing how ridiculous it was at while they were simultaneously more that assumed that it was baby eating people that were running a conspiracy [1085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1085.4s)

against it i see those as equally concerning because i see them both as kind of conspiracy isn't the essence of what i'm focused on what i'm focused on is where um people's [[sensemaking]] is getting more captured by some narrative music and so the mechanisms that i would say [1106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1106.4s)

are in place is one increasing complexity makes it impossible for anybody to process all the information so they have to um decide some things about who do they trust and of course you want to trust the cdc or a trustworthy institution but if you don't then you want to trust whoever seems like they're doing the research of why you can't trust them and [1126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1126.679s)

so you get that kind of person because who the going to go through all the cdc data and then compare it with the veres database data and then compare it with this investigative journalist not to mention the ipcc and [[climate change]] and the social justice cop shooting things and to have a self-informed opinion on all these things and then to question is the data [1144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1144.14s)

even good or is the was there underlying bias in the nature of what was funded in the research and so all of the data is on one part of a bell curve unevenly distributed and so i would say the just sheer work and epistemological nuance it takes to make sense of things this complex rules almost everybody out and then the consequentiality of it makes you want to not just sit in uncertainty [1167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1167.059s)

but have some sense of it and then like the emotional in-group out group polarization around like and this is again one of the [[social media]] things that like anyone who's questioning if the vaccine was the right approach for public health can get thrown into some like tinfoil hat wearing anti-vaxxer thing like that they're they everybody's going to die of whooping cough and smallpox because of these  crazy people when some of them are that and some of them have a pretty nuanced view of like hey i think there's more that we could have done on small molecule research and there are reasons why doing that small molecule research would have made sense and there's more safety analysis on vaccines and so [1208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1208.94s)

there's something where it's like we see the craziest left pink haired antifa people and we see the like dumbest most bothersome maggot people as if representative of the whole groups that then makes the groups polarize against each other yeah and so i think the complexity the total number of topics the speed the crappiness of the [1233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1233.299s)

underlying scientific substrate with replication issues and all of those things the media environment that orients towards the [[hypernormal stimuli]] which will be confirming bias and sanctimony and in group identity and giving us the most like extreme versions of the other the extreme and straw man never steel man [1255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1255.559s)

versions of the other side i think that whole suite of things leads to this where the number of people that i knew who i felt like were doing really a good job of [[sensemaking]] say coveted related issues whether it was lab leak or whether it was proposed small molecules like ivermectin or whether it was vaccines or [1278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1278.059s)

i saw some people at the very beginning doing a good job of not getting captured by one side or the other yeah almost all got progressively captured by one of the sides simply because they're their their ability to pay attention to everything they just couldn't and so certain choices ended up give making the news feed of information coming their way more oriented in a certain direction and [1299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1299.2s)

it became very hard to not be affected by that yeah i always think of sort of almost like a world war one you know nomadeland trench warfare and it feels like the trenches are getting pulled further and further apart and i'm sure you've got the accurate stats but i feel like it's like less than five percent of all [[social media]] posters or the majority like make 90 of the news so it's all the it is all the extremes and as the no man's land gets bigger and bigger and more and more treacherous tank traps and barbed wire and nerve gas there's no  way you're gonna make the sprint to the far side to jump in that foxhole with your potential enemy so that like no man's land is dead so i you know there are no atheists in foxholes right [1339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1339.74s)

so you got to believe something if you're jumping in with and you're gonna and you're more prone to jump back to your closest affinity group than you are to risk crossing the metal yeah and so it just seems like that that is that the price of defection from my identity my identified in group is so high at this point so for instance you could have a whole bunch of live and [1360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1360.679s)

let live middle americans that are nonetheless getting pulled aggressively right would correct because the pink-haired baby killing antifa you know hooligans are such that are such the caricature of the left at this point yeah that people are like i don't know which way to go but there's the moderate middle is just getting [1382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1382.94s)

completely hollowed out i actually don't have these stats tristan and aza were telling them to me but it had to do with um it was a really cool social science that was the center for humane tech folks for anybody yeah yeah it had to do with pulling people um on the left about what they expected the percentage of certain things on the right were and vice versa and seeing how [1405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1405.559s)

badly off in a negative direction they were something like um asking people on the right and i think it was more specific it was like asking trump supporters at a rally what percentage of democrats are um lgbtq themselves and they thought it was like half or something like that and it turns out it was like less than six percent and there were similar things [1425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1425.419s)

that people on the left you know what percentage of people on the right want to cut all social services or whatever and they estimate it to be way higher than it actually was so you could tell that they were both dealing with caricatures of each other that they thought were true like they were dealing with two standard deviations to one side of the gaussian distribution of what was [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1443.72s)

really there thinking it was the median and a gaussian distribution is fundamentally the familiar bell curve that people understand yeah so um and this is you know pat ryan's stuff he was talking about this years ago on auto cults that you would he was predicting that we'd have this phenomena that things like colts would just start [1464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1464.78s)

automatically popping up as a function of the information technology landscape because when and i would say the underlying cause of this or one thing we have to factor is that of all of the singularities that kurzweil talked about um the info singularity is the first one meaning the the singularity meaning the point at which things change so radically that we can't [1489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1489.679s)

really predict what's going to happen or how to respond to them afterwards and where humans kind of can't keep up with the pace of technological change the idea of the information singularity is that so much information would be published that no human could process all the relevant information about anything and so there would no longer be an [1506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1506.059s)

expert and that's already true right it's already true that you'll have more peer-reviewed journal articles within a specific domain because of how big the world is and universities all around the world than any expert can keep up with even in their own domain and obviously way more journalism on topics and and so obviously now we have to get into computational processing of all of that since the human can't process it anymore um but now it's well what are the algorithms and how are we doing that computational processing and currently the answer is things like news feed algorithms facebook and other news feed algorithms at least deciding of all the stuff out there what makes it into your feed because you're not going [1547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1547.46s)

to see a million news articles in the day so the ones that make it in are based on personalized data harvesting about you mostly focused on not trying to make you believe something but what you actually interact with the most but the tricky thing is what you interact with the most is mostly based on one marshmallow stuff right mostly based on like what actually makes you click with [1566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1566.24s)

it because the title was so salacious and effective at making you click or so many of your friends already had or something like that and so that phenomena means everybody doesn't see the same thing because there's too much stuff everybody can't say the same thing and so what everybody sees is the stuff that is ai split test optimized in the direction [1587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1587.299s)

of their twitchiness right i think twitching is a term you use it and that usually means in the direction of their [[confirmation bias]] because people are less likely to click on a thing that uses words they don't even know what they are which means likely to expand their uncertainty set than things that are already primed to them and something bothersome and so this is not just a [1604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1604.039s)

left right anymore thing it's like it's a algorithmic basis of cult generation and then one of the really up things i don't know if you well of course you saw you pointed out to me i had these deep fakes made about me these audio deep fakes um there's a catabites is that there was that the term catamite so there i just there's a third one that just came up i [1626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1626.299s)

am a uh i'm a biracial colonialist in this third one but yeah i'm large i contain multitudes you know i can have my contradictions you know so yeah catamite i mean just to be clear this means like a a young male homosexual sex slave for older powerful man whatever so there's this thing with my voice talking to lex friedman about me being a catamite and citing a poem about it [1648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1648.5s)

whatever and of course to be clear this is an ai generated deep fake i had nothing to do with it i didn't authorize it there's just enough of my voice and lex's voice you can make like this and this so the first step was the ai to curate all the content which is the facebook algorithm or the youtube algorithm or whatever or the google algorithm the next one is to say you [1671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1671.12s)

don't even want when you do a google search to see 8 000 result pages right million result pages you want to see a customized chunk of info for you that read all of those and calibrated it to you and that's what gpt3 can do right that's what new advanced generative text ai can do is read that and say in a thousand words summarize x for me so when you have and it can also do it [1694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1694.1s)

in anybody's voice and pretty soon anybody is similitude so now you imagine the auto cults where not only are they being attracted by what they're being attracted now which is just who all is attracted to the same memetic twitchy thing but where you can actually produce bespoke content from bespoke content producers in that space so you you can actually create gods of the auto [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1713.659s)

cults um that's all very weird it's super weird but and also like i'm trying to think so i think it was a gpt3 um it's an ai kind of generating algorithm and somebody was already starting to use i mean a talk about [[race to the bottom]] and whatever that law is that like any tech online will be used to make porn first it was the equivalent [1732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1732.559s)

of that but it was for info marketers so they were infant marketers who were already trying to explore using ai cutting edge ai tech to generate better info marketing sales copy of course right but like anybody who's seen that rash of dolly um you know everybody and their mother posting their on their social feeds i said this you hear my five ingredients and here's my piece of [1753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1753.799s)

art right but like from from ai generation um to speak of like the auto cults and even creating the deities right you could not only do it in the name of you know like give me a summation of quantum physics and as stephen hawkings or richard feynman would say it right but you could even do it as jesus as buddha yeah as loud too right you could [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1773.84s)

actually literally give the ai the coding to give a voice to our divine archetypes which to me seems super fascinating but also wildly spooky okay so totally spooky will get abused this there's an important principle about tech that is related to this thing you said about um it'll be used for porn first or then internet marketing which is any new technology enables new things right that's what technology does is enable human seducation that they weren't able to do it will be used for all the things where there is incentive to use it and where there is more incentive and return on that incentive it'll get used to the most there so whenever somebody's developing tech they might be developing [1814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1814.7s)

it for a certain purpose it seems really lovely but what they have to realize is it's going to be used for every purpose that is not regulated that there is incentive to use it for and it will be differentially used the most by the ones that have the most incentive to use it and so when we're developing new tech we have to take that really [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1833.059s)

seriously when we're dealing with tech that makes changes to the world as quickly as powerfully in that scale and as irreversibly as the new tech does so you develop crispr where you meaning you develop some gene editing technology where you have um ethical review boards that you have to go through with lots of good scientists on them to assume this is to [1851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1851.059s)

assure this is a good thing to do in a biosecure laboratory but then you publish a paper and you're doing it for immuno oncology right to figure out how to edit genes to cure cancer but as soon as you for that purpose with that money in that major institution figure out oh here's how we splice the gene to do that and you publish it now anybody with really basic hardware and [1871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1871.58s)

without ethical review boards can do that for any purpose they have a purpose for you make ai and make it [[open source]] and you can use the ai for any purpose to optimize computational processing of lots of stuff i won't even talk about what they could be but people you know it's not that hard to think about so um this i'm actually [1890](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1890.539s)

i believe that we're moving into a world where and this will be a radically controversial thing to say good you the reason why we don't like the term regulation is because we don't trust this government or a lot of people don't trust this government or any government structure the idea that anything that is [1908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1908.059s)

powerful enough to regulate will become corrupt all the kind of libertarian public choice theory critiques those are all good and those are all right i i don't trust it for the same reason but i also don't trust open market proliferation of exponential catastrophe tic and with no regulation where of course if we're talking about drones or cyber or biotech or and specifically [1931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1931.159s)

synth bio where like the ability to synthesize genomes corresponding with the best institutions in the world putting the pandemic grade genomes that they're figuring out online through publishing and the same with ai the world just doesn't make it through that right the world doesn't make it through decentralized [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] with no oversight and you can't regulate [1949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1949.7s)

after the fact the way we always have like after ddt killed so much stuff finally we figured out how to outline yeah i mean roundup right took 30 plus years we're still sorting out forever chemicals and lead and gasoline and all those things right lead and gasoline is estimated to have taken a billion iq points off the world and made us 4x more [1970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1970.94s)

violent holistically to just stop engine knocking and that was right 4x yeah more violent yeah the real politic assessment i'll send you a link on it there's an incredible explainer piece somebody did on um lead and gasoline as an example of externality to stop engine knocking we take something that you have to mind that would never occur in the [1993](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=1993.559s)

biosphere and figure out how to burn it and aerosolize it so that it's in everybody's breathing air that makes us both dumber and meaner and so then we get people doing social science and doing this real politic assessment of humans are too dumb and mean for things like democracy tour for things like nice systems to work it's just genetics where nasty chimps it's not nasty [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2013.539s)

chimps and genetics it's like that we did that we could do differently um and information's in the brain piece that assessment the forex more violent and the um a billion iq points off like literally dumber and meaner was one chemical one chemical right we have 15 million chemicals in the chemical database of the american journal of of chemical [2036](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2036.34s)

whatever it is and how many of the other ones also have negative behavioral effects um let alone on the other side of the  up topsoil that doesn't have the trace minerals that were needed for healthy neurotransmitters and everything else so the whole let's study humans under ubiquitous conditioning and then call it nature [2058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2058.06s)

and then say we're too because of ubiquitous conditioning like no they we have to so i have massive critiques of humans are this way studies where we studied humans that were all conditioned by the same things and then took it as inexorable um that was a tangent well i mean i mean i remember wait the [2078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2078.3s)

the controversial thing i was going to say we have new categories of tech have to be pre-regulated so you can't put lead out because the market just figured out how to add it and then only after enough people die and people figure out how to measure invisible stuff and the policy groups go against the financial vested interests that are already making billions of [2099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2099.46s)

dollars on this you finally regulate it in one area but it's hard because other areas are using it nobody wants to be the first one to incur the cost of the regulation we don't get to do that with ai by the time it's causing that much harm we're all dead or or any other exponentialized existential tech right there's no whoops duo there's correct so a world and you [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2116.859s)

also can't do national regulation because all these things create global effects very quickly it's not like we can say oh we're we're going to stop doing gain and function research in the us and that's going to matter if the global pandemics because of global [[supply chain|supply chains]] either you get everybody to do them or doesn't matter that much same with ai weapons [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2135.04s)

so now what i'm saying is in the face of the amount of power of [[exponential tech]] you can't let it out unregulated first because either some people want to do  up stuff with it or simply the accidents right that happen and you can't regulate it at a national level so you do have to have something like global regulation that does safety analysis on the tech [2160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2160.599s)

to say okay these applications not all applications these applications done in this way are a safe way to put it out and we continue to watch and iterate to change regulation and change tech design i'm i'm saying we don't make it through if we don't have something like that and yet nobody has proposed any system of governance we would trust with that that would be like some centralizing power [2179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2179.619s)

[[dystopia]] so it would be like salt treaties or some other nuclear non-polific proliferation exactly but boom across a whole additional swath of stuff and stuff that moves way faster nukes move really slow and so you don't have to do as much because everybody can't make nukes just when somebody publishes because the physical tech is owned but that's not true for since [2199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2199.359s)

biorea so we do have to there is no and the same with the like everybody becoming conspiratorial or standard model biased there is no way for us to make this much sense of stuff like we do have to come up with institutions that can process this that are both lots of humans and computational capacity that we trust and that we have a reason to trust meaning [2218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2218.32s)

the kinds of audits and transparency and everything to avoid corruption and embedded mistakes have to happen so this i think is a really critical thing to to realize what okay so so that's that's one that has has baffled me i mean i i even wrote a bit on it a month or two ago which was just what i've noticed is that you know basically because what you're describing is a some [2240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2240.82s)

version of a benevolent new world order you're saying we do need global coordination for global existential issues we need to have authorities that have the capacity for enforcement and policy making and the thing that's baffled me again back to this what's happened in the two years of quarantine and that kind of thing is that this is not just ultra far right [2261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2261.94s)

libertarian john birchers you know afraid of the you know afraid of the the council on foreign relations in the club of rome and all these big time baddies and you know and watching for these things it's now on the left hand side it's on the spiritual psychedelic transformational cryptocurrency side so everybody even nominal progressive do-gooders are now completely freaked [2285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2285.04s)

out about any form of coordinated transnational governance right and are now seeing that as signs at the beginning of the end the move to the panopticon surveillance state you know lockdown and so now even people who would have who would normally follow everything you just said and agree and be rooting for benign authority to do something on our collective behalf are [2310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2310.839s)

actually now so suspicious in resistance resistant to any signals of glotron's national coordination that they're sort of they're going to to be in you know at minimum passive resistance all the way to potentially violent uprising but they're right and so this is where this is why i talk about catastrophes and dystopias as the two things we have to simultaneously [2337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2337.48s)

prevent and find a [[third attractor]] that's neither because if you um maintain if if you try to avoid too much centralization so you use things like markets or the separation of lots of countries or whatever you end up getting these kind of [[multipolar trap]] [[race to the bottom]] things they make the up ai weapon so we have to also make the [2358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2358.72s)

up ai weapon so we don't lose they produce the carbon so we have to nobody can stop [[climate change]] so we get catastrophes from that model in order to avoid those catastrophes you can't just use incentives you have to be able to use deterrence which is because somebody will figure out how to have enough incentive to do the whatever the  up thing is and if they get so [2378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2378.94s)

much advantage out of doing it then everybody else has to do it or lose then you have to have a deterrent that says no nobody gets to make bio weapons if you start making bioweapons we're going to stop that forcibly right we're gonna do something to stop that and whether that's tariffs or or war or whatever it is um so then who implements that to have [2397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2397.96s)

enough control to prevent the decentralized catastrophe processes looks like enough control where you're like wow to have the power to do that looks like an uncheckable power and the history of uncheckable powers is not pretty right like if if people are concerned about excessively concentrated power that just means they're good students of history [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2419.38s)

because there's nothing in history that tells us that's a safe idea and even if you have something like obviously there's lots of times where a very malevolent dictator pretends to be a benevolent dictator that happens all the time but even if you have a more benevolent dictator you get the rules for rulers dynamic which is the equivalent of a [[multipolar trap]] on the other side the rules for rulers is if there's that much concentrated powers the more power-seeking people want it and so you've now centralized the point of capture of the system even if you set it up good at first this is why it's like the republicans and the democrats it's a common thing that they'll be like when they have their guy in they want to increase the power of the executive [2458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2458.74s)

branch and then they get really upset that they increase their power of the executive branch when the other guy gets in because you just you your guy doesn't stay in and you increase capture possibility right so anytime you have a system that has a lot of centralized power how do you prevent capture and how do you prevent corruption becomes the core questions how do you build that in [2477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2477.04s)

given that we've never had good answers to that because the more malevolent people are willing to do up stuff to get in that position the benevolent people can't stay totally benevolent and adequately deal with the malevolent ones under most situations so they either lose and it gets captured or they become capable of winning which makes them less benevolent i.e even the good king's [2495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2495.76s)

putting heads on stakes to make sure that people knew not to do that thing because it was better for them as a whole population-centric wide kind of punishment strategies so we have to prove we have to solve the catastrophes but we have to do it where the control mechanisms are uncapturable and uncorruptable that requires new it's not [2516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2516.4s)

democracy as we have understood it it's not markets it's not monarchies it's not communism it's not it's actually some better processes of governance that the same infotech that is messing the world up enables if we do it rightly um well now you so now you're getting into the post the post-democracy question right and back to origin windows and [2539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2539.56s)

what people are willingly can consider these days and so you were riffing on a lot of the [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] the [[race to the bottom]] if someone's going to do the shitty if someone's going to be a sociopath if i if i have a basically a non-zero suspicion that there is a sociopath amongst us then i might as well do the sociopathic thing just to prevent the other person from doing it [2558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2558.82s)

right and then having us all with our pants down so therefore we can get sociopathic behavior even if all of us were actually otherwise decent people but just not in 100 trusting environment and that sounds like the slate stock codex famous peace meditations on malik of which it was very rudimentary [[game theory]] as he went through all those things like it's far better for a bunch [2576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2576.339s)

of countries to sign on to anti-pollution treaties but keep polluting because what they want to do is actually hamstring everybody else to get an advantage all those things right so for people that are listening along at home right the slate style codex meditation of malik was one of those kind of central pieces a few years ago this also brings up i think is it [2593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2593.74s)

mentious gold buck i forget that's his he's here in austin now but um you know he's been arguing fairly boldly and provocatively he's kind of one of the peter thiel backed um disruptors chaos agents right but he's arguing for some form of a return to monarchy aka plato's philosopher king aka you know uh russo's you know [2616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2616.06s)

enlightened despot so what do you think given the asset the risk assessments and the coordination challenges that you're describing about the are we at the end of a very brief really fairly wobbly 300 year experiment in representative democracy and are we moving towards as victor orban and and many others right are starting this kind of signpost a post-democratic [2643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2643.66s)

um much more centrally controlled forms of form of governance and is that an innovation or or an aberration from where you believe we ought to be going with this yeah to to get into what i think the [[social system]] adequate to safely steward the power of [[exponential tech]] must be there might be many different specific proposals but what the criteria that must be in place to do that are and to do it in a way that are also not um highly central control dystopias it's beyond the scope of what we can do right now because there's a a lot of other ways that the things fail and a lot of [2694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2694.3s)

other criterias to make them work we'd have to build but i'll speak to the democracy as a very temporary thing um there's a lot of different smart assessments about why democracy is a short little blip um or or as we understood it and obviously that occurred because of some fairly unique things happening and the [2713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2713.14s)

change of mostly infrastructure um obviously the the first one that comes up in the kind of mcluhan line of the way mediatek changes stuff is the printing press enabled people to uh overthrow feudalism because you could start having a newspaper in textbooks as opposed to the hand copying of information where you had to be very wealthy to have access to information [2735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2735.22s)

and nobody thinks the idea of people being engaged in governance who have no idea what's going on makes sense right so the foundation that was a founding fathers kind of question right it was it was the illiterate mob yeah dangerous it's a big part of why they chose amongst many things representative democracy rather than direct democracy but um [2754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2754.119s)

but the the founding fathers were coming out of modernity's enlightenment and the idea that the two prerequisite institutions for democracy to have occur were a very high quality of public education and a [[fourth estate]] or an independent news and media so everybody could be educated enough to understand all of the issues [2778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2778.9s)

and they could ongoingly be informed enough that there they could participate in collective choice making and of course that was also in 1776 the complexity of the issues was way less you could actually be an expert in most everything technical at the time right you could understand the issues of agriculture and infrastructure and whatever if you if you were a kind of [2798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2798.7s)

renaissance era enlightenment person um the ben franklin's and the thomas jefferson's of the world yeah right and that was why they wanted a representative democracy they're like the ab it's too high a burden for the average people to study all of that but some people can and the average people can study enough to be able to see who understands the issues better and pick [2817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2817.9s)

them to represent them obviously now we're in a situation where the average people can't actually tell good thinking from populism and the the representatives not only couldn't be an expert in everything mostly they're not experts in anything or even particularly good thinkers or people who are good at winning those types of political games so the whole basis of that things eroded [2839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2839.14s)

um but there's definitely a the idea of if we are are you've seen those things where they go around and interview americans to show how sad it is about how dumb americans are they're again obviously not showing i'm sure the people who said the right answers didn't make it into the editing of the clip so it's again trying to show us a straw man version but do we see a [2861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2861.94s)

lot of young people who think africa is a country and um can't name previous presidents and all of that yes there's a lot of that so obviously our like public education is not doing what it would need to for something like democracy to make any sense at all because what should the average person's like how much do we want to factor their [2881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2881.859s)

thoughts on international relations if they think africa is a country well that's always buggle me as all these new shows have rushed to be like hip and online and like who's tweeting what and then they'll take you know they'll take [[social media]] things and they'll be polling people and like do you think syria has weapons of mass destruction they're like how the [2898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2898.72s)

would you know like why are you polling a body politic that is absolutely has no access to the relevant information to ask what they think and it's somehow considering that you know up-to-date newsmaking is baffling to me okay you're actually saying something else really important not only is it clear that the people aren't getting educated enough for base things like [2917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2917.26s)

like geography and history right not just even news and classified information um so the education's not there the news and their relationship to it is not there and as we mentioned rather than a newspaper where everybody reads the same thing you have a [[social media]] feed now where everybody reads a personalized to them optimized for engagement which is [2933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2933.52s)

usually more limbic than good thinking modes so you have the like the [[social media]] thing isn't just the end of the [[fourth estate]] it's an anti-forth estate it exactly does the opposite effect of what the [[fourth estate]] was supposed to do which is rather than give everyone a unifying basis of information to go to a town hall on it gives everyone [2951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2951.7s)

the certainty on stuff that is exactly opposite of what the other people have certainty on and straw man villainized versions with a social contract is broken and if your greatest enemies are your other uh are your other citizens of your same nation in a democracy that's at the end of the democracy so there's one way [2973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2973.24s)

where there's the like the mcluhan-esque sch scholars say that um like the guy at uh center for digital life the democracy is a function of the written word being the dominant method of media and that actually tv was the beginning of the end of it and internet was completely the end of it because when the written word was the dominant method [2999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=2999.52s)

not only did you have everybody could have textbooks and um you had the enabling site in newspapers but you also had people had to read long form to get any information and they had to know how to write right if they're writing letters and sending them via mail um i.e the development of all of the modern democracies we have in that time it meant you had to be able to linearize [3019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3019.38s)

your own thought you had to be able to hold kind of longer thoughts read books things that didn't have [[hypernormal stimuli]] it's a very interesting assessment that democracy as we understood it was the result of a particular way of info processing that was mediated by a certain info processing technology without which that thing won't work anymore you can't do [3039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3039.599s)

short attention spans and democracy because democracy requires being able to hold many people's opinions and lots of conflicting information and so that's one there's like three others but i can see you thinking on that one that i was gonna say of like what was unique to the founding time of democracy that isn't true anymore where the way we think about it moving forward [3058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3058.38s)

has to update itself well yes and then just to give us a little bit of elbow room on that because my sense is because you know you're you're effectively idealizing or straw manning a sort of age of the early republic where you know all all citizens and voters were sort of extended renaissance well you know literate competent [3077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3077.94s)

thinkers and and some version of renaissance men and at that time just men um but you know i mean being an american historian myself i mean like those early republics it was a bare knuckles brawl and they would host keggers and get all the people wasted and they'd throw barbecues and cookouts now put your vote in for our buddy who just [3097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3097.98s)

sponsored this like there was all kinds of thumbs on the scale there was the federalist papers there was all kinds of quote-unquote fake news and diatribes between madison and and mason and those guys in back and forth and right so so i just think it is important to understand that like democracy has always been a wild chaotic hopelessly messy process versus some idealized origins state that [3119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3119.78s)

we have fallen from grace and therefore can never get back to i would you know to me that almost gives us more resiliency now being like oh these are the these are the variations on the theme but you know but but this is there's continuity versus a fall from grace as far as the narrative arc i don't think that what i'm saying is that it was that [3142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3142.44s)

perfected thing and think what i'm saying is that the the narrative of how democracy should work it was being developed at that time was partly for political expediency and partly based on real political philosophy and earnest thinking right and it's usually always a mix of both because memes that are just based on earnest truth with no motive usually don't catch on that well because no one's that motivated to push them and so we we wrote this article and consensus project called um where arguments come from on the kind of think tank research industrial complex of like if there's an idea that is trending there's probably somebody that cares about it that is [3181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3181.44s)

making a trend that funded all that research and did all the ongoing publishing and that that's not connected to what is simply the best idea anyone's ever had in the space um and there's quite a few in there that we did that are relevant to these topics the one on how to mislead the facts is another relevant one on the people who get caught into biases that are not the [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3200.64s)

conspiratorial ones but the standard model ones um and think that it's all fact checked but um so let's i'm just trying to take the earnest part of the philosophy of democracy that was occurring and say that was the philosophy upon which the political thinkers were saying this thing might work right is we could give everyone a good quality of education we [3224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3224.819s)

could give them all news and we could at least have a representative class that was very well educated on the topics and the smallness of scale so the printing press the education thing um and things like public education so that that was being insured for everyone which wasn't a thing under most of feudalism right um and tripartite government term limits [3243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3243.72s)

there was all sorts of these fairly ingeniously constructed checks and balances effectively to nudge towards some expression of the infinite game right the intention isn't definitive when in loss but to keep playing like they would i mean to me the architecture whether or not it's still fit for purpose you know secondary question but i mean it does feel like the [3265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3265.14s)

architecture was surprisingly thoughtful i think either if it's principles of the architecture that actually are still fit for purpose so a different instantiation a different way that they play out so like i don't know if you've had alexander bardon he has a he's a he's an interesting thinker in these ways he has a interesting analysis of the three branches of [3285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3285.48s)

government and that most every system of governance that was stable long term had three things that were somewhat similar um like structurally similar to um a judicial uh executive and uh legislative branch um i think so i think things like separations of power are trying to get [3307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3307.38s)

to something deeper which is avoiding centralized failure modes either from corruption or bias and blindness right and that doesn't mean we have to do it through separations of power like we could do it through something like uh computational methods allowed the transparency on the information provenance of the whole system and [3330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3330.059s)

insurance that all of the information was being processed with all the relevant epistemologies but that wasn't possible then so simply checks and balances on power was how you prevented centralized capture corruption or failure say that last sentence again um separating power into these various [3348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3348.619s)

branches was ways of preventing centralized failure modes yeah and they didn't just do three branches like the mad the mad king idea right just somebody going totally off the rails and having unchecked power or even the emperor has no clothes situation where it's not that they're idi amin and they're have really really nasty but where they are [3368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3368.819s)

uh in a distortion bubble where they have a bunch of yes men and a court around them they just can't tell what's true and the thing is failing for those reasons right so the idea of like a centralized system can have bad intent at the top it can have mistakes at the top it can have modes of capture at the top for others who have [3390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3390.78s)

bad intent who aren't currently there so let's just keep it from being centralized so there's some type of um stability and the two alone can't do that which is why the two-party system gets so is it ends up just driving polarization so you have to be able to have something like this three-body problem of you know having them check each other and that they do [3409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3409.079s)

different things it makes sense that the judicial branch is optimized for wisdom that can adjudicate where the letter and the spirit of the law are different not optimized for everybody has a say the creation of new law is optimized to go slowly representing everybody and the ability to execute really quick that has to be quick has limits put in [3430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3430.38s)

place but there's a branch for it like like all that was smart but it would i mean i would say it's i would make the case that the thing that trump did was he broke tripartite government right so he had an attorney general he just replaced attorney generals until they did his bidding although both of his choices were more than happy to the [3450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3450.839s)

legislative branch went fully in the tank so instead of the senate bowing up on him and being like you're you're the rhino bro and we're gonna let you know that what this auguste institution will or won't do right now this gets back into information ecology and doing an end run around public opinion via twitter and a bunch of other things and the judiciary which most people while [3469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3469.8s)

people were rage tweeting about you know trump's latest inflammatory thing you know he and mcconnell were packing the courts top to bottom they posted more court appointments in three years than obama did an eight and now roe v wade and all these other things we're now seeing you know including mcconnell's utterly cynical stalling tactics of appointments and this and that right [3490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3490.74s)

you're now we don't have a tripartite government um and so and to me that was the most concerning thing 20 watching 2016 to 2019 i was like oh this is now a decades long hangover this is not swapping out the guy at the top every four years and yay we get our guy back in or anything like that this is now a systemic rupture [3512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3512.339s)

of any of the checks and balances that you just laid out in the theoretical model well so this is we're saying two different things and i think they're both true and important we're saying that even if the previous system was well intact it would be insufficient for various reasons and we didn't start to lay out all those reasons but it would [3532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3532.44s)

be insufficient we can say things like we don't have ways of ensuring that the representatives are representing the people because we don't have everybody going to town halls and because of smallness of scale type issues and we um don't and the fact that you would regulate after the facts because of the speed of tech being so slow doesn't work anymore so there's like a few things [3553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3553.559s)

where it's like even if that system was intact it's no longer an adequate system or the thing like it needed a [[fourth estate]] to actually function well and it doesn't the other thing is that that system isn't even intact right that system has eroded profoundly um and so both of those things are simultaneously true because it's eroded so profoundly we know some major changes [3572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3572.22s)

to governance are necessary and i because it's even if it hadn't it's no longer fit for purpose in the exact way it implements itself even if some of the principles are right re thinking about well how would we rebuild now something that is aligned with the right kind of principles that uh both create the kinds of regulations that are important without the kinds of [3595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3595.98s)

centralizations of power that are really problematic and i don't think it's an unreasonable thought for anybody to say if we were even the most like founding father staunch person doesn't think the founding fathers would have built it the same way if they built it today exactly those guys brought here like printing press wouldn't wasn't the [3616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3616.04s)

exciting information tech right um and given the total amount of information to process and given all of the changes like of course this current system would have a much deeper digital interface everybody can't fit in a town hall anymore but everybody can fit in the internet to be able to directly input on things and um we can make identity as secure as we [3637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3637.98s)

have for online banking easily right that's already um secure to be able to do a lot of things differently so hey the idea that it we have to and can start to restructure the thing very deeply um i think is a pretty reasonable thought okay well there's a lot there in fact [3656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3656.46s)

that that fellow that i just mentioned who's in dc politics who just came to our recent event was talking about parallel democracy movements you know and the idea of people starting to sort of spin up alternate ways of governance and you've been working with the digital and direct democracy efforts you've referenced the taiwanese expressions which is [3675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3675.359s)

increasingly acutely relevant right now um you i feel like you've been hinting at a model do you want to just play this through and kind of lay out what you think would be optimal i'm imagining there's some version of [[blockchain]] validations and security and anonymity underneath it or not um you know again banks don't use it so we don't have to [3695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3695.819s)

go that way but what would your best take be in a quick sketch of some version of digital democracy and then what how on earth would you pry the wheel away from the entrenched and potentially corrupt or captured powers and interests that are running the old system yeah it's tricky if we were to say how do you def how do you design an ideal [3719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3719.46s)

system from scratch even if you come up with a good design obviously it'll probably be wrong but let's even say we came up with a really good design how do you do enactments and this is where a lot of people like the people in the teal circle become libertarian is they're like your utopian ideals take so much violence to enact in the presence of all of the vested interests that [3739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3739.02s)

don't want them is it still a utopia after you committed the amount of violence needed to enact it um that's the sheikhavara paradox right yeah exactly i mean he starts out as a starts out as a as a bleeding hot do-gooder you know doctor on a motorcycle and ends up capping people in the jungle for a reason that we can empathize with [3758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3758.579s)

like the process that took him in that direction right and but empathizing with doesn't mean want to repeat um and the other so the the other direction is not design a perfect system and then be stuck with enactment problems the other way is what is intelligible to the current system they could vector it in the right direction and can those shifts converge to a new adequate thing the forward and reverse engineering approach and i i like to do both of those and have them enter inform each other because i do think there are certain risks that are clear and eminent enough that they require acting and where the forcing function of them can make [3803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3803.099s)

certain action occur they can also move us in a fundamentally different direction um i'm biting my tongue because it will it will take a lot to construct some of these things let me let me construct one other thing first when i was saying that at the time of the u.s democracy and the other kind of modern european democracies were roughly in a similar-ish time but let's take the us democracy obviously the critique is also pretty clear that the the political economy right you can't separate the government and the economic system the the those things are embedded especially when it's something like [3843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3843.059s)

liberal democracy that's trying to make the market do most things it uh it did depend upon genocide and slavery right it was not a political economy that worked without the most gruesome things and then it only we can only kind of say slavery ended when you actually really look at the history of the pnh indentured servitude system following and like that but also [3865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3865.92s)

it was able to kind of start to end because of fossil fuel slaves because of the industrial revolution and then this gets us into the nate stuff we were talking about earlier which was oh now rather than extract from another race we can extract from nature radically faster than is possible to produce enough abundance that this kind of system works this is another one of the ideas of why [3885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3885.72s)

this is a short-term one of what like whitney calls the carbon spike a very short period of time where the abundance went way up from anything it had ever been where you can have people happier with whatever the system is because you're creating so much distributed abundance of certain kinds that everyone feels like well at least it keeps getting better every year but in a way [3903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3903.72s)

that is fundamentally not continuous and actually [[self-terminating]] yeah well i mean and that's worth talking about right because if because all modern political theory economic theory i mean i mean friedman hayek the austrians you name it any and you know all the way to keynes and and and the new economic whatever the quantitative easing just print more [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3924.78s)

money because keynes was basically like hey you you can't ever print too much money provided you can deliver on the investments right but there was that huge key asterisk of provided you can deliver on the investment right and sociological consideration on that yeah and and but all of that was within that carbon pulse so it was basically like we were trying to do sleep and physiology [3943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3943.2s)

tests you know when everybody was given an eight ball to go you know to go home for the weekend and you're like okay none of this is actually more [[human nature]] tests on ubiquitous lead yeah yeah yeah so so one of the things that nate has said that i think is is really memorable i mean you're talking about slavery right because because there is a there is a strong argument yale [3960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3960.599s)

historian evan morgan made it american slavery american freedom he's like hey slavery is a central prerequisite yeah from attempting the experiment of democracy it happened in greece it happened in rome it happened in the united states it's not until you get to the mid 19th century with the advent of coal and steam power and slavery and genocide it wasn't an empty land you had [3979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=3979.619s)

to kill all the people that were here oh and then massively extract all the crazy abundant natural resources which were one-time bonanzas also but but his point is is that just in like right now today we are enjoying via the fossil fuel bump the equivalent labor of 500 billion humans to support eight billion or really more like more realistically support four or five billion max right [4002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4002.18s)

and and that 500 billion effectively you know units of manual labor or enslavement are we're borrowing from our great grandchildren so we're effective really enslaving the unborn to enjoy our current standards of living and just i everyone might not be clear on that the the fossil fuel slaves you're talking about are that if caloric units of barrels of oil [4024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4024.26s)

yeah so if you were to replace all the things that are running on hydrocarbons the automation that's already occurred with human activity would take about 500 billion humans to do to run the current [[materials economy]] yeah what comes to mind is like friends if you've got any friends that have ever posted up in asia and they live like [4047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4047.119s)

rajas you know in kathmandu or or or india or thailand or wherever and they've got maids and they've got gardeners and they've got all these things you're like we're all kind of doing that yeah there's something called the um global slavery calculator i don't know if you've used it but it you basically plug in your lifestyle details [4064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4064.94s)

and it's not looking at carbon slaves it's actually looking at humans that are in indentured servitude conditions that are making your iphones and that are mining the cobalt for the battery for your iphone and basically saying based on your lifestyle how many slaves i think 27 on average for uh an average american um meaning that many not just the fossil [4084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4084.2s)

fuel slaves but actual people entered servitude equal types of positions required to make the [[supply chain]] that your life depends upon right that thing doesn't get to keep happening that way for a lot of reasons and the reckoning of that is really significant okay well this now brings us back to where we put a pin in the map with that initial thread so we kind of [4105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4105.98s)

jumped into [[sensemaking]] meaning making post covid information ecology et cetera now let's come back to nate higgins our friend and colleague on energy blindness is his general take which is hey you've got to include where are we pulling all this juice from to create the substrate of the society we live on and then of course what are the implications as we appear to be getting to peak cub and [4126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4126.679s)

slash the downhill slide on the other side um if you ask me like as i'm trying to run the numbers and i'd love your input i don't know if you saw any of the stuff on sri lanka right which has recently gone through political instability slash collapse barry white weiss did a kind of snarky this is this is the problem with [4144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4144.08s)

woke esg goals this is what goes wrong and there's definitely a whole information you know warfare on woke esg right like the the coupling those two things together um and but and i think i think her critique was superficial and snarky because some additional kind of energy scholars that i was tracking was like hey you know sri lanka was a more or less subsistence economy dirt poor of about 7 million people they got they got the world bank imf double whammy you know like let's give you debt and investment and then you stop growing all your food and you start exporting more of that kick-ass tea you guys make and we'll give you more return on your cash crop to then go and buy and import the foods you [4184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4184.759s)

actually need and the population ramped from 7 to 21 million and then they were trying to get off pesticism this is a gross simplification but this is kind of more or less as i tracked it then that you know lately they've been made a couple of efforts to get off high petrochemical high nitrogen npk fertilizer you know turbo industrial agriculture that then has created a [4204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4204.699s)

crash which was also mirrored in in holland in the netherlands with like the dutch farmers you know protesting lately and driving tractors kind of like our truckers convoys all these things happening but now you're in a situation where sri lanka as a government as a people they're potentially trying to do the right thing they're trying to get to [4222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4222.08s)

more sustainable farming but they're already addicted to the heroine of the global market economy and dependent upon it therefore to get off it is going to create incredible suffering and that you know most estimates were that the natural whatever that would mean carrying capacity of their land mass is about seven million people so they're looking at you know a 14 million person [4242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4242.42s)

catastrophe even if they were to try to get back to anything resembling a sustainable um a sustainable arc for a care you know for a sustainable population but now isn't that just us at eight billion people like i i what i don't understand i mean do you read peter zion's book the end of the world's just the beginning right so like if you take zion as one [4266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4266.54s)

thumb if you take nate as another throw in baklav schmuel and anybody else doing this kind of big meta systemic energy informed analysis um is it not it feels like to me we've got two choices right we can either you know the kuznets curve of like greater technological advancement creating decreased pollution over time it's a question mark i don't think that is [4288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4288.5s)

established canon by any stretch you know this the papers i've seen have said that hey that was true for western europe and oecd countries it's not proving out when you test the asian tigers when you test a bunch of other post 1950s moves in that direction but nonetheless it's either we find a way to successfully navigate off the top of this curve of the the carbon pulse on to [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4306.98s)

something sustainable and renewable with all the caveats and asterisks about what sustainable and renewable actually could or does mean you know with lithium ion with windmills with all the high embedded energy we currently call renewable and can we do that without a without a total disruption to our socio-political economic structures and can we do it in time to avoid it other [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4328.52s)

population crash and the erosion of our capacity to innovate further the einstein's thing of you know the fourth if the third world war is fought with nukes the fourth will be with sticks and stones like are we not heading to that bifurcation because to me that seems like the monster bifurcation like you've got surveillance states and catastrophe and a [[third attractor]] which seem beautiful but to me even before that even more foundational is either we just hop off one sinking iceberg to land on the next as far as the foundations of our energy economies or we suffer a population collapse of truly horrifying proportions because if you look at all the population codes they all hit the hockey stick mid 19th century and then and where it's we're at a billion people [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4373.58s)

at 1800 we're at eight billion it's doubled in mine in your lifetime so surely you take away npk fertilizers you take away gen medically modified crops you take away you know over tapped groundwater which isn't you know i think nate even used the term fossil aquifers just i think just to indicate non-renewable millions of years to recharge kind of thing [4395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4395.42s)

um are we not looking at a malthusian horror show when and if we simply run out of oil is a really good center point there are a few other ones that are not reducible to oil when you were mentioning npk in sri lanka's issue there and what that did to population obviously npk started with n just hoverbosch method and nitrogen [4424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4424.1s)

fertilizer and we went it was rocket which was rocket engine stuff for the nazis for anybody playing along at home that's wild military industrial complex  but we went from i mean the green revolution agriculturally in that way was as deep a part of the thing we can think of as like the beginning of industrial revolution as [4444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4444.5s)

using hydrocarbon energy um it was used hydrocarbon energy and make soil radically more productive in areas that it wasn't productive yeah and productive for a very narrow set of purposes meaning caloric consumption to grow open sustained populations so we went from about a half a billion people at the beginning of that curve for the whole you know like however three [4463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4463.34s)

million years since the early things we'd call humans or in 100 000 years of current ones ever to get to half a billion people and then half a billion to 8 billion largely as the result of being able to extract nutrients from soil faster than they could replenish themselves and those all that nitrogen of course also equals nitrogen affluent as it [4483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4483.86s)

flushes out which equals dead zones in the ocean which is very close to a catalytic tipping point level of being able to make life inhospitable for any large number of people and so what we're looking at is we haven't are our economics has oriented to uh have everybody oriented to benefit themselves where they will extract unrenewably and [4507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4507.86s)

they will pollute and renewably maximize extraction and externality and the entire market system is oriented around maximizing extraction and externality right maximizing profit the profit is an extractive measure revenue minus expense um how much you get out of the system more than you put into this system it's supposed to be a measure of productivity how much did you add in terms of the [4528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4528.26s)

value of putting those parts together but of course that's not that's not factoring that nature has a balance sheet and so um it's very important to understand that profit is as much a measure of extraction as it is of production and we have to be we have to think about that more realistically it's like the tolstoy [4545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4545.6s)

quip and anna karenina where he says behind every great fortune lies a theft yeah have you written writ large right across our civilization you could make the case that behind you know behind our abundance simply lies just externality so that georgia guidestones were where i don't know what the happened they were blown up recently but you remember they said maybe in a population of um [4566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4566.36s)

half a billion that's the pre-hubber bush level of the um you know that that was the pre um industrial agriculture level of global population so some people look at it and say how many people can the earth support sustainably well the most we empirically know is maybe around that number now of course techno technology can create [4586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4586.94s)

efficiencies that could make that number higher but does it make it 8 billion does it make it the projected numbers we're going to this is a very important real questions but let's also look at other fundamental stuff so we're looking at energy but then the energy is mostly now moving some bits around in the digital world but mostly moving atoms around in the [4605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4605.239s)

physical world and it's important to understand that where everybody's focused on we can keep growing gdp forever without hurting the earth because it'll all be digital value now that's a nonsense idea because the digital infrastructure runs on a physical infrastructure you need to do a lot of rare earth mining to make all of the computer chips and you need [4621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4621.739s)

to use a lot of energy to run the server farms and all that kind of stuff and ultimately there's only people have a finite amount of time and attention to engage in content online and so you do end up getting a diminishing return on how much like what how much of the economy can be purely digital relative to the bits part relative to the energy and atoms part yeah we we don't get to [4642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4642.38s)

eat we and we live in these meat suits and they are in 3d irreducibly so in the same way that we have an issue on energy we also have a fundamental issue of atoms is that all of the atoms in the [[materials economy]] are coming from unrenewable extraction and creating pollution and waste unrenewably on the other side and so to close those atomic loops where all the new stuff comes from [4665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4665.719s)

old stuff and none of the old stuff turns into unrenewable waste or pollution and that the energy required to run that closed-loop cycle is sustainable energy those are like the beginning requirements for the [[materials economy]] of how we live in relationship with the planet and of course the closed loop means not only not just the minerals needed to make stuff but also [4686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4686.32s)

the the process of that acquisition is not destroying the species extinction and biodiversity loss and like the biosphere that we inhabit what it is so when you are energy informed or you're kind of like biodiversity formed or you're like closed-loop [[materials economy]] pollution etc informed those all look bad i mean i did just read somewhere that [4710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4710.32s)

where only like someone was talking about closed loop renewables and battery recycling right to just to just electrify all of our transport and they were saying we're only at something like a quarter of the extracted and converted stock of batteries to be able to be in that so we still need to do like three to four x more mining before we even have the stock to engage in definitely [4731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4731.06s)

demand the amount of today not at the demand amount of three to four years from now on an [[exponential growth]] curve up okay well so so talk to me about that because one well one of the things yeah yeah and one of the things that peter zion for anybody following along that that book the end of the world is just the [4749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4749.6s)

beginning which came out a couple of months ago is kind of kick hit public saturation one of his major tubs to thump is demographics right what is happening to the aging of populations everywhere around the world in particular hottest hit probably china basically his thesis is the faster you modernized the basically the steeper the cliff so england took four generations [4770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4770.179s)

germany took three japan took two so they've all got some buffered edges to their demographic codes but the the asian tigers the china crazy ramp up of the post you know obviously isolated communist era those guys are all just running off the cliff and a billion chinese are going to be 600 million within a few decades and then that completely erodes the worker capacity [4791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4791.48s)

the economic output gdp et cetera et cetera and potentially even the viability of all the of these [[nation state|nation states]] um elon musk has been you know tweeting about this of course it's mostly not been taken in context to get sensationalized whether he's having all these babies with all these women and that kind of stuff but but how do you [4809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4809.84s)

reconcile those because to me when elon's like we should have more babies i think what he's really saying is we should have more super genius montessori kids and less poor stabbing kids in sub-saharan africa right i mean i'm absolutely putting words in his mouth that may not be right but when you've got a demographic critique [4828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4828.08s)

like zions and you know just think of yourself as the ccp or anybody any government you know sweden i think or somebody in scandinavia is actually trying to sponsor dirty weekends for couples like literally we'll pay for you if you conceive over the weekend because our demographics are tanking as well so it's clearly a you know almost national security issue of how do we have more [4846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4846.86s)

people to keep this train going how do you reconcile that with the flip side what we just talked about which is potentially that a stable carrying capacity of this planet absent access fossil fuel you know wattage is half a billion a billion to take your pick but somewhere radically less than what we're talking about now and it's clearly based on near decimation not extension or [4870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4870.26s)

expansion of our global population because it just feels to me like the people who are focusing on each one aren't including the other perspective correct the when you make a system that is dependent when you make a global system where would we then depend upon it but it is dependent on a unrenewable process you're gonna have a problem because at a [4894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4894.8s)

certain point the substrate that that system is depending upon says the system has to change and yet we've made a lot of other things dependent upon that system and that's what we have in a lot of ways right now we we can't not keep growing global gdp exponentially with our financial system being what it is because where it was it [4915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4915.679s)

was supposed to be that there were goods and services that were exchanged and then we figured out a way to make an amount of currency that indexed the value of goods and services it's very hard to figure out exactly how many goods and services are being created so at a certain point you get central banks in a brentwood monetary system and you just basically say the financial system [4932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4932.719s)

now has its own mechanics people are lending money whether it's just putting in a savings account and the bank does that or it's traditional debt or whatever they need interest on that money back because they're they're letting someone else use their productive capacity rather than use it themselves in which case they would grow it so the financial system now has its [4950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4950.179s)

own physics where it has to grow just to keep up with interest not also factoring the other reason that has to grow in terms of uh more advanced types of debt and um and money printing and things like that but just to keep up with interest compounding interest means you get an [[exponential growth]] curve to not deflate the value of that currency that means you have an exponential [4973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4973.159s)

demand on the physical earth which both means energy and raw materials and given that that's been coupled to population that also means a continued demand on the people being able to do the people parts of that material economy to do that that's nice well if you know elon talks about a um factory being a cybernetic system ultimately this whole thing is a [4995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=4995.659s)

cybernetic system which the tools are complicated not complex they don't make themselves but it just to find cybernetic system uh a complex control system that like in artificial control system that um in this case involves human elements and technological elements and coordination of those human elements and so as soon as you realize the people [5019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5019.96s)

make the tools the tools don't make themselves they're not self-replicating the way that animals or people or plants are but the people make the tools and then the tools predispose patterns of human behavior to get them to make more tools because the people who make and use the tools get ahead relative to the ones who don't so then everybody has to and etc so the people make the tools the [5037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5037.42s)

tools in the controlling patterns of human behavior that system as a whole that is the tool human system that the tech stack human system is a complex cybernetic system and nate calls it the [[superorganism]] benjamin bratton calls it the stack um you know we've called it the [[paperclip maximizer]] or molok um but it so since humans are part of [5058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5058.9s)

that cybernetic system and that cybernetic system has an [[embedded growth obligation]] or print airplane scenes term that he popularized they're embedded a growth obligation to exponentiate its output you need an exponentiation of the population well that was easy because it was being built on a time where the population was very exponentially but then you required [[exponential growth]] of all those things and you get to a place where the limits of growth which is why that was a good term for that book back in the day the limits of growth don't let it keep doing that thing but now what would it mean to have a financial system or a way of mediating exchange of value and property rights and access to things that doesn't involve interest we would we don't know anything that is like would is there's nothing in play to change that currently and so yeah where's bono when you need him we just need forget africa we need global debt forgiveness we just need a quick reset and now do before the removal of glass-steagall that might have seemed like a good idea right before radical deregulation because the idea hey [5126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5126.52s)

there's radical wealth inequality it must be all of the like super duper billionaires who have the money and are loaning it to everybody else so let's just do debt forgiveness and only the uber wealthy will get kind of in that everything else will be better that's not true um now because of the deregulation everybody's retirement funds when we're [5147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5147.34s)

talking about government employees and teachers their 401k is being lent out and so if you do that that jubilee everyone's retirement is gone and they don't know how to run their life and work as old people and so the system is really set up to be hard to change yeah well listen i want to talk to you about this because a [5175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5175.12s)

this is deep node so anybody listening along we are in deep nerdland and and i i mean i'm i love it and i'd love to get to ask you the kind of questions i don't get to ask too many folks um and if you know um there's that film that came out on netflix it's one of david attenborough's like a couple of years ago called [5193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5193.06s)

breaking boundaries and it's a complete departure from his normal look at all the pretty animals and it's with johann rockstrom uh rockstrom from the potsdam climate institute which is arguably one of the most credible um you know institutions in that space and and rockstrom is basically just describing you know nine parameters or whatever it [5213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5213.04s)

is around the world tipping point kind of you know gauges to be watching and where do we stand in each of them and and and he then came and presented to our friends amory levins and the rocky mountain institute folks and one of his and therefore rmis assumptions as of last year i think was we are effectively going over the falls in the barrel we [5234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5234.76s)

came in and so much of your critique and analysis is this is [[self-terminating]] this is self-termining that's [[self-terminating]] these are all inescapable generated functions of demise the only solutions are for us to reinvent education reinvent capitalism or economies reinvent politics and governance so run the [[thought experiment]] with me i hear what you're saying and you know the logic is fairly airtight other than humans have always muddled along with these imperfect situations and conditions and institutions but if you take that we're going over the falls and the barrel we came in what's your prognostication like we are who we are we have our goofy dysfunctional captured government we [5276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5276.52s)

have our wacky inflation incented economics we are who we are we are products of our time and place and the inertia to our existing way of living um exceeds our trim tabs to you know to borrow one of bucky fuller's notions um ability to do this so what's your sense realistically other than somehow having this confab of world leaders and thinkers that just [5303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5303.28s)

suddenly decide enough's enough and we need to rebuild everything simultaneously from scratch right what's your actual sense of capacity to go over the falls in this barrel we're in yeah so there's a lot more things that we should construct about the other non-reducible things that are [5330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5330.719s)

not able to continue that the system depends on they're [[self-terminating]] because then it gives us an even deeper sense of what has to be reconstructed um i i won't go down these rabbit holes but let me just mention briefly we were talking about the problem of the financial system having an exponential [[embedded growth obligation]] that is connected to a [[materials economy]] that does where you just can't do that on a finite planet with a open loop [[materials economy]] but the financial system also even deeper if you have your assessment of value all quantitative and a single quanta right dollars then the value of [5370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5370.06s)

everything that is qualitative gets converted to quantitative what will the market bear and all different metrics get converted to a single metric how much of this person's creativity this original rembrandt how many copper how much for this animal's life and it's all dollars so what that means now is like the real question of can i convert tons of co2 into [5394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5394.6s)

saved rhinos or less parts per million of mercury in the ocean or higher quality of life for old people or or like no they're fundamentally different things those quanta are those those metrics are un inter-exchangeable with each other but when you determine the market-based value of all of them in a single metric then rather than maintain each of them with their own accounting [5417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5417.699s)

and logic that they need where you maximize extraction externalization is where the logic of the dollars ends up operating because if i value something that doesn't give me more dollars i lose economically to those who only value things that are quantifiable extractable exchangeable then they have more power in the system so those that have the most perverse value system end up [5438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5438.52s)

winning and determining the system so the future system won't have something like a single fungible metrified currency that's really different that's so different right because then if you say okay well we'll have lots of different currencies for different things well if there's an exchange between them then you end up still [5457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5457.54s)

getting one quantified i mean one one thing so who's your reserve currency that everything is scissors so that's an example again of like oh the future things we're talking about are really really different and there are so many of these and it's important if we're going to try to talk about how to design a future because if we if we were just talking about these issues [5478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5478.48s)

that we've talked about so far regarding the global mega machine and energy and like that and we weren't recognizing that we're within a single digit number of years from tabletop gene synthesizers in basements which actually i think gets us to globalizing catastrophes faster than these other globalized things do we wouldn't have to focus on regulating [[exponential tech]] that fast or the [[exponential tech]] applied to ai applied to population-centric kind of warfare and mind control so it's all this at once right and that's the important thing most everybody gets overwhelmed with one of them and then over indexes everything on that thing and but the solution to that thing makes other problems worse most of the time sure but this is this is this is the [5519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5519.94s)

schmachtenberger effect right like like listening to you and listening to your credible running down all the threads and all of them being [[self-terminating]] my sense as let's say just as a listener right is like i either slit my wrist or i gather my loved ones and i off to the deep woods because none of this is solvable given how we've done so far yeah i think it is unsolvable actually [5544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5544.179s)

and so thank you for bringing this up um something i find interesting in the current thinking environment the as you mentioned of everybody being kind of deeper and not clear thinking rabbit holes one of the other things i've noticed is that it's very common for people currently to go from high epistemic certainty to when that's [5568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5568.36s)

challenged adequately epistemic nihilism in one step like they're super certain about whatever the thing is regarding um covet or [[climate change]] or institutional racism or whatever and if some and mostly they're closed to having their child's thinking their their thinking challenged at all but if you do adequately challenge it including the solution that they have hope in because [5591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5591.1s)

as you know as you bring up people need hope if you challenge the hey renewables aren't going to get us there in time to solve the [[climate change]] problem because dot dot or whatever it is they go to i don't know what's true and but not let go that's interesting let's work on that and figure it out but like a give up right annihilism and you can't go from certainty to nihilism and [5610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5610.719s)

possibly have any chance of being a part of the solution or being part of solution you have to be able to say i don't have anything close to adequate certainty but that also means i don't have adequate certainty that the whole thing is inexorably i should i should not have certainty about what the right answer is but i also shouldn't have certainty there's no answer those [5630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5630.34s)

are both unfounded and so i should say the unknown unknown set is pretty large there's a lot of  i don't know and there might be a lot of solutions in there if i don't know the problem space well i won't even know how to recognize them because i'll think the thing that just solves the tiny part of the problem space i currently know is a good answer and it [5648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5648.34s)

externalize and harms somewhere else so i need to actually be willing to engage in understanding the problem space better so i can recognize good solutions and then i have to be engaged and working hard to figure out what those might be so i think the people like people's willingness to sit in not certainty and [5666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5666.699s)

work harder really important and that's that that's just worth emphasizing right sort of agnostic um optimism yes right i don't know yes right and i'm keeping the faith regardless faith is a key word i don't think we have any chance without something like a faith and it's not a faith that um god will figure it out and i don't [5691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5691.06s)

have anything to do right it's not a 2012 will make us all higher dimensional light beings or jesus will come back and fix it or the new version of jesus will come back and fix it which is the agi will um become super intelligent super benevolent fix it all for us um those types of faith are totally pernicious and um and the and the [5708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5708.46s)

atheist movement get rid of them for the obvious smart reasons they're a child's faith right but there was a kind of faith that every innovator had that a solution might be possible that a new discovery might be possible that had them work in the presence of the unknown so hard to find something and it's a faith and possibility not uncertainty not in a specific thing [5729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5729.159s)

right um there is no such thing as like real inventive innovative work that doesn't have a faith at the center of it um and so i would say i don't know if this is exactly true but um i heard from gene houston once when she did her did her phd thesis was uh like this helped kick off the human potential movement back in the day and that she [5752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5752.44s)

um studied 50 of the top creative polymath geniuses of the time looked at their psychology and wanted to see do they have anything in common that the rest of the population doesn't have in common that is developable it could be the basis of a future education human development system and she studied bucky fuller and margaret mead and linus pauling and jonas salk and like the [5770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5770.679s)

great luminaires of that time and the first of the qualities she said she noticed that they all had in common was that they all had an extremely positive emotional valence associated with failure and you can see that there's like a kind of sad superficial version of this that silicon valley has taken called move fast and break things [5789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5789.28s)

um but there there was a deep thing she said when she talked to bucky and asked him what does it mean if you're failing did he started rocking in his chair and smiling and he closed his eyes and he said it means that there's an intimacy with nature that i have because i'm working at the edge of human knowledge i'm working on touching nature in the cosmos in a way no one ever has because [5807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5807.94s)

if people already knew how to do the thing i wouldn't fail i would just implement the recipe i'm only failing because i'm working at something nobody knows how to do and there's something so ennobling and honoring and beautiful in that and that's a different relationship to failure right than most people have and that's what makes a bucky or a jonas [5825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5825.82s)

hawk versus most people and if we started to have now this is one of those things in terms of like population centric do i think that those people rather than representing extreme outliers on the right of the bell curve that we could actually move the whole bell curve to have more people functioning in similar ways i do believe this and well dude interestingly random not proposed this is the new bucky filler biography inventor of the future which just came today and i just i just read the quick book review and it turns out that he's fundamentally like most of his the prior biographies are kind of hagiographies by by disciples and this one is more of an even-handed one and it's just a very [5863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5863.26s)

very mixed more complex picture of bucky fuller the man who turned out to potentially be a bit of a kind of a gas lighting womanizing cantankerous misanthrope as well so so just you know just for us to all give i mean if nothing else right to give ourselves broke ass permission to do our partial combo fallible bests and not think that we can't all attain some of those [5889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5889.719s)

qualities that that james houston was describing because like everybody's banged up broken and partial and still can make it make a positive dent in the universe yeah i think that's it i think that's super important i do think i haven't seen that book i'd be curious uh i'd be curious to see it i had a i definitely had a process with many of my heroes growing up whether it was [5911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5911.02s)

muhammad gandhi or mlk or whatever that when i got the more kind of real politic biographies it was less purely rosy than the thing i had thought and that was actually really good right because of the point you mentioned that someone can be pretty fallible have a lot of damage and still actually do incredible work and that doesn't mean that we should not work to take responsibility to really [5932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5932.679s)

try to clean that up in ourselves but it does also mean that we shouldn't take the presence of those things on ourselves or others as a limiting factor of the possibility of meaningful contribution yeah absolutely i mean that's why we kind of playfully coined that term 80 20 awoken to broken like like the fact it will always be that that is our planck's [5949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5949.36s)

constant is just 20 up human we will always be that and then and then the plug i always make for nancy keane's book she's the hobby business school historian her book forged in crisis which is dietrich von bonhoeffer rachel carlson frederick douglass um shackleton and lincoln and just these this really beautiful contrarian set of biographies of their moment of crisis [5972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5972.88s)

and challenge and why they're in the history books and that they were just scared shitless flying blind going on their best guess and just the profound humanity of these historic figures and how they shape the course of history but they did it from incredibly humble mortal fallible positions that after the fact after that all the dominoes topple in [5998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=5998.679s)

the right way we can look and see his destiny or history and then sort of absolve us from being part of that same process so it just feels really important to kind of ground ourselves in our broke ass humanity and willingness to try anyway it's it's interesting because you know a lot of the people listening here probably are [6020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6020.219s)

pretty interested in their own growth as people and that's why whether it's how do they eat healthier and take better supplements or do the right meditations and psychotherapy or study the right topics they're interested in how to be a more whole complete person um and part of the motivation of that is it's just intrinsically valuable for the [6043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6043.26s)

quality of life another contribute to their family but also the idea that they will be in a better position to contribute to the world from there which is true but it's also interesting to notice in those biographies and even more extreme cases with churchill and you know so many others you see people that contributed in really profound ways who [6060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6060.0s)

were like more broken than average right right not very personal development oriented at all um and there there is an interesting thing where like it if someone find puts themselves or finds themselves in a position where things of real consequence can be influenced by their behavior [6081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6081.6s)

that can that can up level a person in really profound ways and it still doesn't clean up all of those things but it can clean up some of them and or motivate them to transcend it enough um and yet it can also end up having that all the good things they're doing are a little bit damaged and polluted by some of those things simultaneously [6102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6102.3s)

there is no end to the personal growth work to be like now i have arrived and i can start making a contribution to the world because i can unwind my own patterns kind of forever so there is a thing where it's like the way i or into it is there's a sense of dharma of how my life is in connected to dependent on and thus must be in service to the greater world and what is [6126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6126.239s)

my calling there and how do i get actively engaged in that and then a major part of my personal work is where is there in the way of me doing a really good job of course and whether it's a really good job in my family or in my community or in whatever the larger scaled work if i have that is and so it doesn't have kind of the infinite solipsism of just [6146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6146.58s)

personal work but it also doesn't have the work among the world in a way where your own blind spots keep getting in the way and one thing i would say is everybody has blind spots by definition i can't see some things about myself that other people can see about me so if you want to not have your life if you want to not harm things that you care about because of blind spots you can't see  get people that you trust that know you will to point out your blind spots continuously like that's one of the very best things i can say is no amount of self-inquiry though you should do lots of it will give you the same thing that other people's feedback can and this doesn't mean listen to everything that every hater says and [6189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6189.119s)

take it all to heart but it does mean find people that know you well and who'll give you really honest goal feedback but there's an interesting thing so everybody has blind spots it's really good to get a feedback mechanism and work on them it's not true that everybody has defended blind spots in the same way [6204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6204.9s)

and personality disorders have deeply defended blind spots and that's the thing and this is their psychological trauma that creates it but i would offer there have been people who've contributed a lot to the world with major personality disorders because narcissism makes you want to do great things um and you know sometimes external [6226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6226.98s)

validation seeking is a strong motive to do great things um but bain and company the management consulting firm looks similar to mckinsey right has actually they they've had explicitly in their internal documents seeking early candidates on track for partner that are little a little destabilized and have a little hole to fill they actually right they [6249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6249.06s)

want people who are seeking external validation to compensate for internal access they're going to work harder and or in you want that in the um executive positions and entrepreneurial positions you want people that are codependent enough to not have boundaries and just take everything you put on them in the employee decisions um so there's a there's a bunch of [6271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6271.56s)

interesting things there there's a very cynical but pretty true take of that some smart tier one venture capitalist silicon valley venture capitalists the main thing they're actually vetting for is not the technology but the intelligent sociopathy or dark triadness of the founder that will figure out how to win at all costs while pretending that the [6290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6290.94s)

real thing that they're investing in is some kind of like texas making the world a better place yeah um but if you want to win then you bet on people who are really dedicated to winning um which is externalities of the relational web like i'm willing to i'm willing to take the profit right of my social capital and my exchanges and never mind the cost of an of a of a solid thriving social web right we have companies set up to privatize their gains and socialize their losses there's a [[perverse incentive]] on the structure of the innovation very very deeply um but i was going to say so that so someone can do a lot in fact there might even be more people who've made the history book with deep personality disorders than not that said that's where you start getting really questionable there were a lot of positives and a lot of deep negatives mixed in with it so i would say in terms [6345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6345.06s)

of how you want to how people want to orient themselves and who else to trust because everybody has some brokenness but those who are really willing to look at it want to look at it don't give don't get very defensive reactions when it comes up and then take real accountability to change it are doesn't mean they'll be perfect are definitely more worth trusting than [6368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6368.219s)

those who have a defensive answer or an excuse whenever those things are brought up and don't actively seek and receive those well um and so i would offer es except that even in the presence of brokenness you can do meaningful things and wherever you get feedback about brokenness really work on addressing it and in fact actually actively seek input from people [6387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6387.9s)

close to you where you don't get super devastated because you're like that isn't even me and my essence that's a weird that happened in my childhood that's whatever it is me and my essence is the self that wants to transcend that right it's to me that doesn't want to be an who feels bad when people tell me i come off as an sometimes or whatever it is if that was [6405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6405.84s)

really me i wouldn't even be bothered or want to change it i'd be at peace with it the only reason i'm even bothered by that is because it's dissonant with my true nature so i want to see it so i can take responsibility to work on it well yeah i mean you gave me some feedback from that recent gathering where it was effectively some some version of i sort of seemed like a not a great listener [6426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6426.6s)

kind of add and and often changing the topic or spicing things up and because that i was like yeah totally that's me um and and i didn't there was zero i was like oh bring it like if this is it if this is all it is i i could take this all day long and i can for sure apologize to anybody that didn't feel heard in a conversation but i was like oh no that's that's me without a doubt [6446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6446.1s)

so um agreement as friends that if we had that experience with each other or if we heard other people bringing that stuff up we bring it to each other i think that's actually like a minimum requisite of real friendship like a critical thing is yeah i'll actually be honest with you yeah and and and i am grateful for that i mean for me i always just think of you [6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6469.02s)

know physical metaphors but like i i appreciate being able to bow onto the mat with you and train even at full contact although i don't think we very rarely get to full speed but but even even relatively vigorous attack you know for us to you know train with and learn from um versus where we're getting into interpersonal challenges and let's just [6489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6489.02s)

talk about the global x risk [[sensemaking]] oh you know all the all the community all the communities that kind of overlap in our words um my senses is um we're terrible at playing well together and and i held out somewhat naive assumptions of oh if people could only do cycling or some other dialogical [6508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6508.86s)

process or if people learn to take fill in the blank of envy you know nbc non-violent communication nlp in your linguistic programs circling authentic communicating whatever whatever we would all be better at it but it seems like we're just all that does is just um make the obvious glitches in our personality structures and or power dynamics and negotiations it just sends [6531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6531.54s)

them underground and it just wraps them in swaddling cloth and it becomes hotter and harder to actually get to the heart of things so so um i'm aware we're you know we're we're going into a lengthy chunk of time let me just check to see how much time you have left because i would imagine anybody plugging into this channel would be psyched to hear you you know hear [6552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6552.179s)

your conversations um or you know and so i've got three things left and i'll just choose whether we do three or we do one let's do them we're here okay um so so the first then is um you know how do we maintain good faith and and i was just there was some nature program on pods of orcas and it was just [6570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6570.179s)

talking about how the orcas have additional folds in their brains for social cognition and coordination so on the one hand you've got these badass [[apex predator|apex predators]] they kick ass they're smarter than great white sharks right they are literally kind of arguably the kings and queens of the ocean and super smart citations big brains and have extra folds specifically for social [6592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6592.5s)

coordination we feel like at least when you talk about the kind of quote-unquote thought leaders clever people you know asperger kids building models of the universe galaxy brain take your pick of you know what indicators you want to describe it feels like there's a bunch more lone wolves than orchids right so so sort of the lone wolf it could be cats it could be [6614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6614.34s)

tigers line whatever but they need 400 square miles of territory for themselves and they might come up against each other at the edges of their territory and they might sniff each other out but end of the day they want to they they cannot become pack animals coordinated pack animals they that they will fight or they will retreat to the center of their territories so what is your sense [6633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6633.659s)

this is a goofy tee up to a very heartfelt question which is how do we become more like orcas and less like lone wolves so that we can coordinate more effectively together because on the psychosocial level that to me has been a staggering and saddening fail point that i've just watched again and again over the last five to ten years and we're not even into the hot stuff yet mm-hmm [6657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6657.96s)

i think as external pressures get harder the coordination gets easier in many ways um i think you know you wouldn't have seen some of the alliances that happened in world war ii if it wasn't for world war ii um and so that's one thing i think when you're the specific people you're mentioning are mostly not exclusively but mostly either non-institutional thinkers or thinkers who are focused on the topic of what's wrong with our total global institutions so even if they happen to be at an [6702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6702.96s)

institution like fhi or fli or something like that they're still in a different position than most the institution which is they're looking at what is wrong with the world system including the academy system the research system whatever so the people that are most oriented to kind of see what is wrong with the system are probably not people who [6721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6721.92s)

but it's different than the people who developed say inside of an academic system as fingers are looking for iterative improvement but not looking at it as fundamentally broken and thus are conditioned in a way to be able to collaborate through peer-reviewed journals and through conferences and whatever with other people in their fields so i don't i mean [6741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6741.239s)

i would say academic collaboration is also really but the that you're bringing up is a uniquely challenging case um because i think anybody who is saying everything that we know is inadequate then typically if they're oriented to do that they spend a long time thinking about well what would an adequate way so [6764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6764.76s)

there's not some existing traditional frame they trust that they will say can adjudicate our differences with each other or it can give us a basis to collaborate now sometimes that's because of a weird disposition they had to begin with i'm smarter than everyone i don't trust anyone i always know what's right right like the woundedness of the gifted child [6781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6781.56s)

base in a nutshell sure yeah and this is one of the tricky things is if you have someone who's really smart and sees a lot of things that other people don't see and they're used to every time that i brought this up with people and they knew i was wrong i ended up proving that i was right and they have real examples of that it then gets over generalized where it [6803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6803.219s)

isn't true and they can't see their own blind spots and where people give them feedback about their blind spots or whatever it is they're still sure that they're right and that everyone else is misassessing right um so i would say sometimes those people had a disposition that brought them into that place and that's challenging the other thing is even if they didn't so one thing i'd say is what brought someone to the place what was the generative process inside of them that brought them to the place of looking at what is wrong with the world and how do we need to redo it from scratch if someone is in that place the process they got them there is worth looking at [6840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6840.78s)

then the next thing is what is the what effect did that have on them right independent of what what cause brought them to that effect what effect did that have on them of looking at the actual real tragedies of the world the catastrophic problems not thinking that the authorities have it dialed in trying to take responsibility on it there end up being a lot of frustrations and and [6862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6862.5s)

pressures and scars and sadness and whatever that comes from that and then if they're if they're trying to make sense of that it's probably because they're trying to do something so they're probably overwhelmed busyness-wise so they just don't literally have the time they need to model sync with other people music um so there's a number of factors that are involved um i i would say i've actually had the experience of feeling very in hardened and hot okay yeah i've had the experience of being like at first when i first started diving into the [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] [[catastrophic risk]] fundamentally new thinking on governance [6902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6902.119s)

economics culture tech etc i would say i was naively hopeful that everyone who stated that they had those values did and would work nicely together in the presence of the magnitude and timeline of the issues and i would say i was pretty devastated by bad experiences in that way but then that was par for the course because i was just under informed and [6923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6923.04s)

that was part of learning and then i've also been in heartened at how many people who have spent their whole life thinking about things are willing to update their frameworks and do want to work together and are motivated for these things even if through some traumas also out of real genuine care and love and desire for the [6944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6944.04s)

world and how as things are getting worse in some ways i'm actually seeing more genuine collaboration emerging so yeah experience both of those yeah that's interesting as you describe that because i've had a very schizophrenic experience too like i'll go to events conferences gatherings and it's usually one or the other right it's either oh this is an irreparable [6964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6964.32s)

show everything i was pinning my hopes on is turning to ashes i go home just being like okay now i'm going to the woods but then there are equal a number of opposite gatherings and where where i'm profoundly heartened and inspired and it's on and i think i mean this is i'm just thinking this out loud right now but i think the difference is is the [6988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=6988.02s)

people that really give me hope are the people who have put their stake in the ground at any level of the stack it could be education it could be animal welfare it could be sustainable farming it doesn't matter it could be pick any single spot they've found their place and they're doing their pot and there's almost always a self-effacing humility even if they're doing global global [7013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7013.219s)

scale things and they are just phenomenally inspired self-effacing humans and the ones that typically break my heart my guts are the ones who are holding out some inflated sense of their importance or their role and just never get off the dime on coordinating so in some respects it's almost um it's almost people overreaching [7037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7037.639s)

for too much complexity too much scope too much mandate and yet they haven't really put their stake in the ground versus the people who are simply going to where they are most called and they are in in some respects sort of surrendered to their dharma you know to the to that the part that is that is to do does that track for you yeah it does and [7060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7060.38s)

there is a correlation but it's not like a exact correlation so i want to add a a dimension to it that i see like when you were you said something about like um where you put your hope or where your hope is derived from or something and i i find that the thing where [7085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7085.159s)

like where my hope is derived is totally invisible i can't go to a group anywhere and say we're going to make it through the [[metacrisis]] because of what i'm seeing here um because this person who's doing unbelievably beautiful work and conservation of wilderness doesn't even know about ai [7105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7105.199s)

risk and their conservation work is completely earnest and amazing and has saved all these species and nobody even knows about them but it's also not on track for all the conservation that needs to happen even close and they don't even know how to think about that and they don't know how to think about a financial system that needs to turn all that wilderness into paper clips [7123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7123.199s)

and um i think of joe brewer right down in colombia just just posting these endlessly hopeful but honest sometimes raw updates on just trying to restore a little patch of forests in colombia i'm like thank you you know and similarly there are people who i think are doing very good work on say an area of synthetic bio risk and the fact that the work they're doing isn't at the right rate equations for what's happening globally or doesn't factor some of the underlying [[game theory]] that is needed or so i find hope in those things but i don't find anything like comprehensive hope or i can say and even if i take a few of them i don't say this plus this plus this equals adequate [7166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7166.099s)

solution in time um so the hope is more that like there are more things that i'm seeing that are not sufficient but are necessary emerging in more places that the convergence towards sufficiency is something i can feel but i can't see it well let's can we talk about that can we [7194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7194.06s)

unpack that because because that was the thing i wanted to end with was what we had talked about um in our prep call for this which was what breaks your heart right now and what gives you hope and and i'm whether we've covered the what breaks your heart you could touch back on it if relevant but if not you have said to me and and i [7214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7214.94s)

you know in my most intimate thoughts conversations with my partner julian and you know and close close friends i mean i orient right to some kind of upbeat optimism even though my situational assessment is fairly grim and you've described some long arc of history consciousness cosmology something something something where you [7240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7240.44s)

kind of have a rooted faith that it works out yeah now walk me through that the how and the why of that and then also because i just wrote a book taking you know taking the air out of all hockey stick rapture ideologies how are how are these convictions of ours that it all works out in the end not just blind faith right not succumbing to a happily [7267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7267.8s)

hopeful ever after rapture ideology of like and then some inflection point and then we're all saved whoever's you know the elect unidentified as such um what's the difference between blind faith and radical hope and how do you and how do you steer your way between those two and it's fine if there's a if there's an [7294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7294.4s)

appeal to metaphysics is you know we're just because as long as we tag that transition i'm happy to play into that space as well i don't want to be just a reductionist materialist nihilist existentialist although i can go there on a bad day yeah okay a few things i want to go back and say one thing but i want to because i [7312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7312.86s)

think what you're saying right now is a good place for us to end so i want to complete one part because it'll be useful on the people who give you hope versus the ones that um more break your heart and and so i was saying there are a lot of people where i feel hope in terms of the importance of what they're doing right the fact that what they're doing is necessary is is effective as [7332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7332.84s)

well motivated is any of those things that the collection of those things is not sufficient there's still a big delta of what has to happen that isn't happening i can't see the hope in a place right but i can feel something like a convergence and i can talk about why i feel that but the other thing was that you were saying you know [7352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7352.52s)

um that there are people who kind of won't put their stake in the ground because they have a self-inflated importance of what their role is or i think there can be a correlation that those who are thinking about more complexity might also have uh uh special types of ego challenges [7377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7377.239s)

because they want nothing to be outside of their domain of scope they don't want to trust that anyone else has other issues that they that they need to have the totalizing solution for everything or and or their work has to include and transcend everyone so that they have the their their work is the most important and so whether it's that they can't trust anyone or whether it's that they [7396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7396.679s)

want to be at the top of the stack of importance or whatever there's no question that like certain types of psychologically problematic dispositions can orient people towards thinking about the whole um and someone can also think about the whole and long term because of being oriented towards abstraction rather than the physical instantiation because [7416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7416.599s)

they're just pretty disconnected and disembodied and they actually don't feel real empathy they have just like some abstract sense of utilitarian calculus or whatever right there's plenty of reasons that someone can be a big picture thinker for not great reasons but that's not always the case and i also think that some people doing that work well is really important and not [7435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7435.8s)

more important than people doing the conservation work with the bio risk work or being exceptional nurses but also critically important and i don't necessarily expect them to have their stake in the ground be advancing something that has some clear metric and some part of it it might be advancing insight about why those other processes are insufficient but it's still helpful [7458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7458.06s)

for that other field to grow or how they're interconnected which is helpful for those fields to communicate with each other so um i want people who are thinking at high levels of abstraction and i want other people whose sleeves are rolled up working on things i actually want all those things and i've seen plenty of [7473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7473.78s)

people who are in a specific domain not thinking about the whole thing that is a sleeves rolled up domains that still have plenty of problematic ego dispositions um there's plenty of like music um dark triad middle managers and major ngos that are focused on the environment [7492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7492.02s)

or animals or whatever else and so um i i just i don't want to have the sense that if someone is thinking about things at scale and communicating that knowledge that that always equals not that important or not good at collaborating or not putting their stake in the ground i think both are really important [7515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7515.119s)

um and actually having recursion between people doing on the groundwork other people thinking about that theoretically across more spaces giving feedback seeing if their feedback is actually implemented on the ground that type of recursion is really good and that's where my faith is in kind of like [[collective intelligence]] and curves of [[collective intelligence]] that don't live in any of the parks that really are behavior of the whole not many of them um and what's interesting is collaboration is possible with people's output even if they suck at collaborating um they can still if they create artifacts if there's if there's bodies of content or information that are then accessible in the public domain or right [7556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7556.219s)

there there are some brilliant scientists and thinkers who are impossible to collaborate with but who put information out that helps advance [[collective intelligence]] so they have a role to play too um yeah i mean to me to me i i even not uh jotted this down as this notion of sort of agonistic confederate confederation [7574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7574.099s)

you know and i think you and i exchanged an email 18 months ago where i was sort of like hey you know the funny thing is about all of our different dramas is that virtually none of us would sign up for each others right we sort of like i'm like dude your conciliency project it's amazing but i don't think you're going to beat q anon [7593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7593.179s)

with a better wikipedia page you know or tristan you know working on the social dilemma and this kind of stuff i'm like thank you that's fantastic i think it's it's tragically doomed and i think we probably think that about each other's stuff but at the same time without a doubt right would like we'll be fighting the good fight and scanning the battlefield [7613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7613.34s)

at the end of the day to see your banner still flying and will be deeply cheered and and galvanized if it is so to me that that notion of maybe this goes all the way back to how did we reinvent democracy you know is is that notion and this i borrowed this from uh john gray at london school of economics but that notion of agonistic liberalism the idea that we're not going to get to come by [7635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7635.96s)

our consensus that any utopian singular monolith descends to fascism in its enforcement and that can we tolerate the diversities of our damas and can we celebrate the differences can there be a confederation of the humanity involved while there is absolute multiplicity of approach um and can we celebrate that a little more versus creating you know factions [7661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7661.76s)

and and divisions because we don't agree on the 11th decimal point of our proposed solutions i think it's easy to say yes to that enthusiastically at a superficial level and i think there's a lot of devils in the details um because like the idea of it everybody who is pretty certain that they're right about something that [7687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7687.739s)

history is unkind to their certainty um and that it turns out that they were more wrong factoring more things that were unknowable at the time and so the idea that at least pluralism that can at least make us less certain about any particular subset is good like okay sure i totally agree with that that said some people will have relatively better certainties than [7710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7710.3s)

others where the decimal point really matters on things like can we do like this is very alive right now can we do a limited nuclear exchange that won't create nuclear winter and won't lead the full-blown strategic escalation or breakdown of global [[supply chain|supply chains]] and that's actually a good way to go or can we not do that the difference that's not like one of those we can just [7733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7733.28s)

agree and live and let live on those differences it's like it um okay sure we'll go with your model that the nuclear winter doesn't happen go ahead and let that many nukes fly no no no no you you got your model wrong it is really consequential or i don't think that ai is going to be that problematic if we let it out into the wild because there's such good near-term [7753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7753.08s)

market purposes i have strong motivated reasoning to want to let it out of the wild no no i'm pretty sure you're about to kill everything and you're missing something really critical so there are places where there's that's really consequential and those differences are like can we just live and let live or is the consequence of some of those things stuff that won't live and let live it'll [7771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7771.5s)

actually have second order effects that are really profound historically we couldn't up as bad as we can up now yeah we'll jump up as quickly or as irreversibly so you can see why there's more of a desire for certainty but then there's also more motivated reasoning too much information and polarization that makes it harder to get that well i mean i i think you know just even in pop culture right you can trace this with black panther you can trace this with with the marvel universe blake like that the anti-heroes these days and i think there's there's a what is the sequel to the davinci code i think it's called angels and demons and it's some tech bro who's convinced that the world is overpopulated and we need to actually [7810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7810.139s)

crash the population to save the other half thanos famously with his snap wipes out half of the universe so that the other half can live you know black panthers um i forget what had killed killmonger right his his critique is effectively a black lives matter slash black panthers assessment of racial inequalities like none of the anti-heroes in our movie in [7831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7831.38s)

fact quite often the anti-heroes are giving more voice to the current situation than the nominal heroes and there's been this kind of postmodern play back and forth in our in our mythic mythic storytelling these days where actually the villain actually has has run more of the facts yeah and so the question back back to do we simply live and let live you know a consent is if [7851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7851.179s)

there's anybody particularly if they're decoupled from relatedness from family from you know heart and their humanity and they're excessively in their heads and they conclude there is a hundred percent certainty of a mass casualty event if i don't do something then there's a whole lot of extreme and potentially sociopathic behaviors that they might see as one thousand percent [7872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7872.36s)

valid and actually pro pro-life over the longer term this is the problem with like this is the biggest problem with utilitarian ethics there's a million problems with utilitarian ethics but the and there's also a million things important about it i would say and this beyond the scope of what we can do but i would say that virtue ethics utilitarian ethics and deontological ethics all have [7896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7896.78s)

a role a kind of complete ethics requires various of those systems but let's just talk about utilitarian ethics for a minute this bad thing is gonna like i'm i'm responsible both for the effects of my action and in action if i could have done something and didn't then the bad thing happened i have some culpability in that good that's important but you better watch out uh [7913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7913.52s)

there are current inexorable bad things going to happen i can do something that has some badness in it but less badness in the total badness that will occur if i don't do the thing therefore i'm morally obligated to do the thing that has the sun badness in it that's all those anti-heroes that you're mentioning the it's not that that would never be true right it's not that would never be [7935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7935.0s)

true anyone who has made an act of self-defense it was warranted and harmed someone to prevent their family from getting harmed did that calculus and it might have been warranted right or a country that did or whatever simultaneously though when we started doing it based on population numbers and limits of growth and ipcc calculations [7957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7957.44s)

and things where slight changes in the calculations do lead into very different outcomes and there's a bunch of unknown unknowns that i'm not factoring that could change erratically the major problem with utilitarian calculus is we we usually admit a false basis for excessive certainty of the bad thing that is for sure going to happen yeah because i'm so certain that bad [7981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=7981.079s)

things going to happen i am now morally obligated to do this other thing where i also have a false sense of certainty that it will work and be less bad and so um it's the unwarranted certainty that's the problem there yeah not the idea that sometimes you have to take certain costs to serve the larger good um it's the certainty around those [8003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8003.88s)

calculus it's not only that right there's also do i weight certain things that i care about more than other things and whatever which goes back to what we were talking about 10 minutes ago about the wound you know the trauma of the of the gifted child the idea if i've always been right but wronged right you know my tendency to presume 100 certainty with my own models and calculations is going [8024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8024.579s)

to be higher than if you what you were suggesting 20 minutes ago which was it's relatedness to our blind it's relationships that give us shine light on our blind spots okay return us to our humanity and potentially some more humble um if you have some kind of agonist federation as you were saying of people that have some real expertise who [8046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8046.36s)

disagree but who do trust the um process of deliberation between them more than themselves my faith in that thing goes way the up from any of them on their own or from an unintended democratic choice yes what is the right choice that the general democracy would make about the safety of publishing synthetic bio information or advancing a particular type of crispr like who the [8068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8068.199s)

knows that's not a that's not a lay topic that's a topic where the scientific knowledge is so detailed that's required for how to figure that out or you're going to harden the energy grid well how much hardening do you need based on what the size of the emp or the coronal mass ejection is and what's the cost of that relative to the opportunity space the other things you do those are [8087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8087.52s)

not good things for uneducated democracies but they're also not good things for siled experts with their own issues those are things for combinations of the values of the general population being factored the realities of planetarity and physics and biology being factored the experts and hopefully progressively more earnest process and better [[collective intelligence]] with augmented computation being able to process a lot of stuff that they can't and better processes of transparency and oversight to prevent corruption so that the population does have a basis for trust in those processes all of that together to make a better augmented [[collective intelligence]] system is necessary to handle those kinds of things [8131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8131.8s)

which goes powerlessly close to slitting my wrist or retreating to the woods again but yeah now i want to i want to say something about this so the whole idea of our liberal democracy before we were talking about separation of the three branches of government but there was also the separation of government culture and [8149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8149.619s)

markets right that you have a market that has regulation but has a lot of freedom to do its own thing so that it's not all government controlled and that you prevent monopolies so that the market has its own checks and balances because of voluntarism that that wouldn't happen if you had monopolies and you don't allow monopoly of religion you allow lots of religions so it was a [8168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8168.699s)

check and balance between religions markets states multiple religions with each other multiple companies competing with each other multiple branches within federal government most of government happening at a state level there's a lot done to create a pluralistic type system it's pretty smart but overall the idea is we're gonna let the market do a lot of the innovation stuff and have supply [8190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8190.96s)

and demand an invisible hand guided there's all kinds of problems with that that are clear now that we're not clear at the time of adam smith or even at the time of ayn rand but i'll leave that out for now let's just say the fundamental calculus is you're going to do that but it's there would be a market incentive for organ harvesting and cutting down all the trees so there's no national [8209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8209.38s)

parks and up stuff so we're going to have some state that has some law to be able to regulate some things and avoid crime and whatever so we have a state that regulates the market the main  thing the state does is prevent people from doing things they have a personal incentive to do whether a person or a group of people right so market type incentives stealing is a [8225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8225.399s)

market type activity um meaning advancing personal gain of ownership through a particular process so the main thing the government's supposed to do is regulate market type activity that only works if the people are then the state's watchdogging the market that people have to watch dog the state right if the people don't watch dog the [8245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8245.74s)

state and oversee it which is why it's supposed to be a government of foreign by the people blah blah blah then of course if you don't have that then rather than the state regulate the market the market captures the state and you get crony capitalism with a revolving door between people and big ag and fda and blah blah blah well we were mentioning that the system [8265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8265.599s)

is too complex for the people to regulate this or to oversight the state to be able to see where there are accounting errors and real problems so people a lot of people distrust the institutions right now for understandable reasons i'm saying we need to rebuild the institutions in a way that is fundamentally more oversightful and auditable and i believe [8284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8284.38s)

we can but i'm also saying that we um we have to have a people that don't just  about a bad government while not being willing to engage but who are like okay i do want to see what i really think about the models that ipcc is running and about [[climate change]] this is a big deal i actually want to be able to have [8308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8308.2s)

some sense or i don't i'd like to proxy my vote to someone who i think really does i'm going to do a [[liquid democracy]] thing or i do in which case how do i get educated enough and how do i become aware enough of the biases that i can meaningfully engage where i don't become over certain of the catastrophe but i also don't become over certain that the thing is [8326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8326.679s)

currently fine and so this is that place of how do we let go of the certainty that we know what the right answer is but we also let go of the certainty there is no answer and we're we orient towards faithfulness that answers might exist and they take working towards and then we commit to the discipline and rigor to be part of figuring that out and knowing that we can't do all of it the discipline and rigor of evolving ourselves to work well with other people that are also doing it so that [[collective intelligence]] of groups of people working to do that can enact solutions that is like the discipline of a people that want to be able to reinstate governance of foreign by the people have you said that before because that feels as cogent a synopsis of your optimism that i've ever heard you say well i don't know i've said it quite that way before but there are reasons why i think that is possible at scale that would be stupid to think if it wasn't for actual certain new possibilities that were not previously possible i'll say briefly i don't know [8391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8391.06s)

um if you saw this paper that went around recently on why are there no super geniuses anymore you're the one about homeschooling about aristocratic tutoring yeah yeah and um noting that you've got a strong [[confirmation bias]] to believe that paper but yes go ahead and play through well i i was not from the paris doctor say i [8412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8412.359s)

didn't have aristocratic treatment but it did actually give me some insights on what like nora bateson is a very interesting person and look at how the  she grew up and you know our friend azar askin is a very interesting person look at who he grew up with and so like it did give me something so nora is gregory bateson's daughter for anybody that's listening i don't know aza's [8431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8431.56s)

background beyond his tech background what was it his father invented the macintosh okay almost kind of the center like the the founder of human centered design oh fantastic and so a's is the result of that childhood and makes perfect sense right but so what the paper what this paper said we can include it in the show notes here and then i went and [8452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8452.26s)

checked in with zach and scott ray kaufman a bunch of educational theorists and um various of them who had done the research were like yeah this is like a third rail topic but this is a known thing that and even charles sanders purse did a study himself to say because he was wondering why he was able to make censorship across so many fields faster [8470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8470.92s)

than so many other people were and he's like i i don't think i'm genetically that different like what the answers it so who are all the other people who are really really exceptionally polymathic what do they have in common and he came up with the main thing they had in common statistically though it wasn't one factor was that they were all the [8488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8488.319s)

results of some kind of aristocratic tutoring where they had really exceptional private tutors when they were young and you look at the dalai lama the dalai lama gets a kind of tutoring that nobody else ever has all of the best llamas training the out of you from the time that you're tiny yeah he was a punk ass trust fund brat to start with until his tutors [8507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8507.58s)

got hold of him and and so you're like is the dalai lama the result of a particular educational model that just doesn't scale for but if it could scale would be very interesting and you look at marcus aurelius in the entire first chapter of meditations is dedicated to his tutors there's a reason it was dedicated to his tutors is if you're being raised in that period to be [8525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8525.04s)

the emperor of rome the best mathematician the best grammarian the best red rotation the best historian are your private tutors and one of the key insights i remember reading a paper many years ago that was looking at world-class mathematicians and it was saying what is the statistical correlate we found across all the assessments of what makes someone a world-class [8544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8544.479s)

mathematician like on online to win a field's metal or something like that and it said the the clearest thing is that everyone who became a world-class mathematician the most likely thing they had in common was that somewhere when they were young they interacted or studied with the world-class mathematician and of course someone can try to split the causation [8561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8561.1s)

and say well it was because they were so bright someone brought them there but it's actually the other direction is a very real thing which is the teacher that i get for math in grade school does not think like a world-class mathematician about math they can teach me that's that somebody else figured out but they didn't think that way they don't know how to teach me to [8581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8581.38s)

think that way so i can get the output not the [[generator function]] right and if i'm with someone who is not teaching me how to memorize a quadratic formula but is helping me understand the whole history of why it was never understood and then how it was derived and why they derived it and they're the kind of person that has derived like that themselves from scratch i'm going to get [8598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8598.479s)

a very different level of education and the type of general competence and thinking so it turns out that even up until recently von neumann and einstein both had mathematician governances when they were young before they went to school and um it makes sense that like it seems hard for me to learn mandarin but [8617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8617.14s)

one-year-old babies are speaking mandarin if they grow up in china we're very neuroplastic right whatever you're learning so there were there were like bucky fuller terms that i was speaking as a little bitty baby because that's what my dad was reading to me and so saying isotropic vector matrix and omni interacommodative sound like fancy [8635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8635.62s)

things but it's just whatever the a baby hears they're kind of a medical wait wait what was the omni one omni omniander accommodated it was a word bucky used that i remember was one of my early words and some people who were not bucky familiar were like oh that's a big word for a little kid and it was like it was just because it was used all the time but but it was also that it [8653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8653.8s)

wasn't just memorizing it it was a process of dialogue to understand what does it mean for something to be omni interacommodative that all of the generalized principles don't conflict with each other right across the whole universe all of the constants and all of the laws of physics chemistry biology etc are on the intercommodate it's actually really [8674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8674.14s)

great concept built into a word but he liked to do that but you could just call it groovy right i think that kind of like wasn't that sort of um that's what bucky called it after enough joints i think um but so you got this aristocratic tutoring model when we were trying to [8690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8690.819s)

kill feudalism because it was so unequal and gruesome and create democracy all the vestigial remnants of feudalism were things you want to get rid of and when you had a situation where almost nobody got a good education because of course they were just going to be laborers or whatever they got some basic guilt knowledge of how to do a labor thing maybe and of course the nobility and [8709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8709.24s)

then the aristocracy got to pay patronage jobs of the best thinkers to tutor their kids it makes sense why you'd have such a radically unequal distribution but you'd also get a certain kind of super genius born out of that privilege but the thing is that's not scalable and you were just mentioning earlier will these deep fakes be able to share all of wikipedia's [8729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8729.7s)

knowledge or all of the knowledge on whatever chemistry pharmacologic but also in the voice of whomever so now you imagine the positive version of the ai deep fakes mataverse world where i go to the academy and i can ask einstein and von neumann and kurt girdle to all come sit with me and have a real-time dialogue about formal logic where all of them are [8750](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8750.819s)

both speaking with the kinds of semantic coherence to everything they ever wrote that they would have while simultaneously having access to all knowledge of formal logic that has even been learned since they died and their ability to model my theory of mind and pedagogically regulate how they communicate to my level of understanding well that's pretty phenomenal [8772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8772.3s)

from that's a techno-utopian left hand but but i'll take it let's keep going now i think we're only a single digit number of years away from being able to build this and i think right now we're most likely building because of market incentive dystopic versions of this thing rather than the awesome version this could be but i think we [8789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8789.88s)

could do the awesome version now i also think that corresponding with that the population lowering the reason why we want to raise the population has to do with trying to keep up economic output of the people whatever but of course that's not factoring the technological automation is going to obsolete most of the jobs both robotic and ai automation are going to obsolete most of the jobs [8808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8808.24s)

so then we have to answer what the do we how do we rebuild an economy and what is how do we rebuild an education what is even the role of education what's the role of humans in a world where ai and robots are better than us at most things well what are we still here for what are we uniquely good at and what are we intrinsically incented to do and what is [8825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8825.34s)

intrinsically meaningful now has to be the core question to redesign everything because we're no longer the best at doing most of those things and so it's not just the running out of oil and stuff it's also the becoming fundamentally obsolete in lots of things but also obsolete it in the that mostly we don't like doing and so then we say okay well let's assume that it's [8845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8845.68s)

not pure agi but it is um very smart ability to do computational kinds of stuff ai and robotics but fundamental phenomenology experience human connection is still both intrinsically meaningful to us and we have unique capacity well then knowing how to interface with the robot ai type dynamics and how to do much more in the [8866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8866.68s)

domains of what is uniquely human and we don't have to prepare people for the workforce so we can rebuild an economy from scratch that doesn't say humans have to work to get provisioned because that was only what we did when we needed the humans to do the jobs and you don't need the humans to do the jobs you can also make it to where the humans don't need the jobs and you have a different [8886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8886.359s)

kind of commonwealth stewardship that also works better with ecological boundaries i'm almost there i'm going to converge and close a couple things and then now what my ai tutors are giving me has more knowledge than marcus aurelius's tutors could have ever had but they don't love me they're not they don't actually really care i don't love them [8905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8905.979s)

and there are differences between the [[artificial intelligence]] and natural intelligence so now my live tutor my live teacher is also talking with me and there's i just had the conversation with einstein or jefferson or whoever it is and they're asking me what do you think is different from what that ai einstein said and what the real einstein might say if he was [8927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8927.76s)

alive today or might have said back at that time so now we have to start to think about the way minds are contextualized in history and the difference between natural intelligence and [[artificial intelligence]] and the difference between hydrocarbon self-organizing systems and silica systems and what is intelligence itself and what is the relationship of [8944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8944.08s)

intelligence to send chance to life to consciousness so now the human teachers oriented to those very very deep theory of mind questions that once humans start asking they go recursive on not on knowledge processing on intelligence and and meaning itself and you get these kind of exponential curves and can we have way more people being teachers and way more developed in that system [8965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8965.2s)

because we automated a lot of the things people already currently do so can i have 10 times as many teachers who all get phd level training as opposed to whatever you know current level of training they get starting with kids so the kids get mathematical geniuses they both get a study with the you know einsteins and girdles and whatever but they also get a study with [8984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=8984.16s)

people who have that level of capacity and similar in the way that the da vinci machine is already starting to obsolete surgeons because an ai robotic surgeon is just going to not have their handshake so this the the doctors of the future the doctor nurse role starts to merge more to who can do real human connection with the patient and interface with the ai robotic type [9003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9003.3s)

systems that do a better job at various specialist tasks does that mean that we can develop people that have way more human connection a lot more so we have a much higher percentage of teachers parents nurses high connection oriented roles way more developed and way more ai augmentation of how we develop people to where the einstein and the dalai lama [9024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9024.3s)

become the median of human development yeah i mean to me on the conversations of the universal basic income and those kind of things is like what's the question is always well what on earth would we do you know we would be pointless or purposeless if we didn't have our work which is very you know max baber protestant work ethic he kind of you know cultural conditioning and my [9043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9043.979s)

first sense would be like holy we would go back into child care and elder care and art and music and gardening and community and spirituality like like all the amazing human things that humans have always cared about and there's the and meanwhile we are outsourcing them to bottom of the barrel minimum wage workers instead of making them central to our [9065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9065.34s)

shared human experience so that that tracks really closely with what you're suggesting so do i think that already the state cannot check the market if the people aren't checking the state do we have to rebuild the states make that possible because it's impossible right now yes we have to rebuild the state and the market and info processing and education and a bunch of things but can [9084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9084.12s)

we already have the motivated tiny subset of people listening to things like this say you know what i'm gonna not default to the lazy certainty that everything is because that's just lazy um there's a trillion possible solutions i don't even know of um and in fact the people who i'm listening to who've thought about this [9101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9101.34s)

more than me aren't hopeless so maybe it's numb for me to go hopeless if the people who know the problem is based more than me aren't hopeless right and i'm also not going to default too it's not my job i can't do anything about stewart to understand i'm going to work to understand it and work to see what is mine to apply and i'm going to work to find other [9117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9117.72s)

people that are doing that and i'm going to work to try to be able to rebuild something like bottom-up governance of people who are really making sense of things so i want to see people doing that and i also think that we have the capacity to be developing people with those capacities at scale now there's a boot loading issue right there's some change to make to infrastructure and [9136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9136.92s)

some changes to [[social structure]] and some of the [[superstructure]] that all affect each other take more time to go into how i see that boot loading looking but when you're asking like why do i have hope i was just wanting to play with a couple examples of how the same tech that us can actually radically enable us but the current market dynamics that are guiding it [9153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9153.12s)

don't build that version they build the facebook ai not the it would be so easy for facebook to do audrey tang's unlikely consensus or twitter and up regulate all the things that a super majority would agree upon and everybody gets to see what are all the things the super majority would agree upon and you run a third party candidate that says anything a super majority agrees upon [9169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9169.8s)

i'm going to run that would just start to make amazing change that quickly so it's the tech can do different things and audrey just is [[liquid democracy]] taiwan right so for anybody's looking to track that track her down yeah um so i think that the tech that creates so much power under the current extractive [9189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9189.6s)

and [[coordination failure]] dynamics leads to self-termination but it also enables fundamentally new possibilities that previous social and political theorists could not have thought of because they weren't possible we could not do planetary wide coordination without the tools to be able to do that so um so yeah i do think that if i take all of [9209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9209.399s)

the failure modes that i know of all the [[self-terminating]] things i take the timelines associated and then i say is there any path through this that is both feasible with physics it doesn't require replicators and die lithium crystals and stuff it's like feasible with physics and it's feasible with [[human nature]] and assuming we condition people differently but i don't have to assume that everyone [9231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9231.3s)

has an iq of 2000 and are omnibenevolent to begin with yes i absolutely believe there are models that are adequate that are both possible with physics and possible with [[human nature]] i believe they're threading the eye of a needle i believe there are way more ways it fails but i believe that the likelihood for it to succeed is the people who are [9250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9250.56s)

oriented to how we make it through the eye of the needle and dedicate their whole lives not to asking the question do we or not but how does my life increase the likelihood that it does um beautiful so yeah that notion of leaving space for grace right the idea that if there is there is always that miracle element and kevin kelly has that [9267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9267.899s)

beautiful quote where he's like it's way easier to imagine the devil than god because of basically second law of thermodynamics but yeah everything awesome from the flowers to you and me are highly improbable and we have to get better at believing in the improbable foreign yeah and and feeling it even before we have a thing to believe in [9289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9289.26s)

and then the other thing is i don't believe that humanity is going to make it i also don't believe it's not going to make it i know either could happen and my my disposition is not just because i'm sure we're going to make it so i have that certainty it's that i'm sure that i want my life oriented to what could help it happen and i know that everyone who's [9310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9310.38s)

sure that we aren't has unwarranted certainty and disconnection from the life force yes yes and then so the other thing is i want my life oriented to the best possible future but i also want it oriented to the most honoring of life now so if we don't make it i still wouldn't change any of how i'm living because it is coming from the like [9330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9330.66s)

recognition of the radical amazing that i get to be alive for a second at all right like i had this experience this is so fundamental is like i remember when i was a teenager looking at a sunset and feeling this experience of like i would incarnate this life and i'd go through every hell and [9352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9352.439s)

difficulty for this moment because it's so like as opposed to no experience at all ever like it's so incredible and then i'm like i've already had thousands of moments like that and if they're if i've had thousands of moments that are worth an entire life it's all gravy from here in terms of what's in it for me right like it just keeps being this embarrassment of riches [9373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9373.319s)

that the beauty of life keeps happening and it's all worth it and that doesn't mean the pain isn't painful it just means like i've experienced pain as it works cruciating and i can't feel them right now and i don't choose to dwell on them and i've experienced beauties that were awe-inspiring and i do dwell on them [9391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9391.74s)

and so it's worth it right and so there's also a like if we don't make it i don't just want to be partying in the bahamas i want to be in like sacred service to life because i because i it's it's still i it's the only thing that actually makes sense beautiful well i mean and that feels very um resonant with the arjuna krishna story in in the bhagavad-gita right some reconciliation with the impossibility of this thing and also um that we're never off the hook for playing our part to the hill and dharma is not a utilitarian ethic right it's a virtue ethic which says the utilitarian ethic says i can calculate [9438](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9438.359s)

the possible future states and choose an action based on the best utilitarian outcome except you and i both know that we can't know what the wind is going to be 10 days from now because complex systems are unpredictable and so i want to do utilitating calculus where i can but i also want to say if i can't predict the future each moment is unfolding from this [9457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9457.56s)

moment and there's a trust that the if i'm in the deepest integrity in this moment the future that unfolds from that is the one that i want and so that's like a it's a fundamentally different it's not based on future outcome it's based on a trust of what in full unfolds from the way this moment is lived and the bhagavad-gita is just like the whole [9478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9478.439s)

thing is understanding that dharma let go of the fruits of action and do what is right because you know it's right yeah which also feels like why yoda can never like call like eight ball corner pocket he's always like i'm feeling the force you know but like there's perturbances there's things right but it is a dynamic flow of a complex system right so so yeah [9496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9496.859s)

um because yoda isn't god right we didn't violate idol worship it's not this thing is all determined it's still there's great mystery and i don't know and the wisdom is not i know at all the wisdom is i know i have a beautiful relationship with the unknown ability and still how to live in the presence of that yeah you know and and even i mean the [9515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9515.16s)

one the story that um whether it's you know yoda's agnosticism even though he's jacked in in total gangster he still can't call this he still cannot call the shot right but the the one that um yeah i may noodle on this more but it's the note like for me it's it's the lord of the rings and just the genius of the ending you're right that golem is the [9534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9534.66s)

enemy and he is corrupt and corrupt and you think oh is he going to be savable is he going to come back to schmiegel and he does that whole schizophrenic chinatown you know back and forth right and and it's not that he's redeemed in the end and sam wants to kill him and gandalf's like hold man we don't know what part he has yet to play and then in the end it's not that he's redeemed and [9555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9555.18s)

comes over to team good guy he actually descends into his most corrupted self does the he folds where he is folded many times before you know bites the ring off frodo's finger and that is how it ends up in mount doom and destroyed so you're sort of like and that's what i mean about the the space for grace right we don't know and i feel like you're echoing that really strongly we cannot [9576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9576.359s)

with certainty predict what happens next and if i'm hearing you right what you're saying is the only thing i can do is act from the chew act from love act from defense of and and and and bearing witness to life in this moment and the next moment and the next and perhaps right if there is a path to salvation if there is a path to redemption it lies that way and and we cannot see it from here but if but if we keep the faith in it um that is essential for us ever arriving yeah yeah totally and when the fellowship of the ring came together they knew the task was most likely impossible and they didn't know exactly how it unfold and there was also wisdom that [9620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9620.52s)

guided that it was the right thing to do it needed to happen yeah all right so before i off and sail sail west over the ocean at the end of middle earth um i will hang out i will hang out with you um optimistic and rosie one it's weird to be you know this is actually this is [9639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9639.78s)

interesting nate and i talked about this recently where a lot of the people that i not everybody i don't want to make any general relations that are too sweeping but some people get into being very good at like thinking about [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] because their disposition is that they catastrophized like in the cbt sense of like running worst case all the time in their [9660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9660.42s)

own personal life but then smart and they end up the good side the gift of that is that they're able to think about how could this tech really mess stuff up and how could this agreement get up and how could this be gamed and um but it's also that that's the gift of it but they're that disposition is not oriented to find solutions it's oriented [9681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9681.18s)

to find what's wrong with any possible solution i was talking with a different friend the other day and i'm like look every time i tell you a new possible [[catastrophic risk]] you without a lot of rigorous analysis you just believe me that that's probably going to happen and every time i tell you a possible solution you're like what's wrong with that what's wrong with that until you [9699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9699.42s)

find something possibly wrong with it that's a bias you're running because why don't you wonder what could be why don't you just as rigorously analyze the [[catastrophic risk]] of why that probably won't happen there's a and so i and if one is oriented to catastrophize they won't coordinate with other people for because they'll catastrophize [9717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9717.479s)

the relationships and assume that everyone is them and just doing it for game theoretic power just virtue signaling and everything else and so you actually have to overcome catastrophizing in one's own self to actually be in service to catastrophe as well to be able to think through them and yet be oriented to solutions and oriented to [9733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9733.8s)

collaborate with other people so it's weird to be in a place of like no we really want to understand all the things that are so we can address them but it is so we can address them and that's both the show we not so i and the address rather than just leaving takes ability to save a planet it's just fun jamie this was really fun today yeah yeah yeah well listen so so [9757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9757.62s)

for everybody listening you probably don't need any introductions or reminder to daniel and his body of work and his relentlessly good-hearted contribution to finding ways forwards um but i would super encourage everybody that we will include uh in the show notes a bunch of the different references that you made potentially to that tutoring paper you had mentioned another one towards the [9783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9783.78s)

end we can kind of go back and i'll send all the ones i can remember that sounds great and then just just an encouragement um that out of all of this complexity the simplicity on the other side is for each of us and all of us to find what's ours to do and get cracking and and share share the triumphs and disasters right not just post wins but but also [9804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9804.12s)

seek solace and comfort so that we can keep on keeping on together and get super dubious of your own certainty talk more to people that think really differently than you and really try to understand both what they're saying rationally but also feel the internal state of the trueness of that that they feel and while decreasing your own certainty [9824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowcm7b8Dlw&t=9824.76s)
