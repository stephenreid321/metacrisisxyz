and family as always thank you so much for your support my guest today is daniel schmochtenberger daniel schmachtenberger is a founding member of the consilience project aimed at improving public sense-making and dialogue his writing is focused on ways of improving the health and development of [74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=74.56s)

individuals in society with a focus on catastrophic and [[existential risk]] civilization and institutional decay [[collective action]] problems social organization theories and the relevant domains in philosophy and science daniel and i spend a lot of time talking about the effect of new technology on [92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=92.72s)

our ability to problem-solve as a society we talk about the disadvantages of democracy relative to autocracy we talk about how much of our behavior can be attributed to [[human nature]] and how much to culture and much more so without further ado daniel schmochtenberger okay daniel thanks so much for coming on [115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=115.2s)

my show thanks for having me here i'm looking forward to our conversation yeah there's a lot to talk about but before we start can you give my audience a sense of who you are and what you do um i i think uh that we'll come across in the conversation hopefully i can say [135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=135.36s)

a few things i'm interested in i've been interested since i was young in all the things it seemed like uh problems in the world that mattered that were not getting better with the current problem-solving processes we had that looked like environmental problems and social problems and and i'm particularly interested in why it is that we haven't made more [161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=161.28s)

progress with the sustainable development goals or nuclear disarmament or preventing [[arms race|arms races]] and and then why [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] of lots of types actually increase in the total number of types of [[catastrophic risk]] available and increase in probability seems that there are some underlying [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=179.599s)

[[coordination failure|coordination failures]] and uh kind of [[game theory|game theoretic]] dynamics that make our problem-solving capacities not adequate to the problems we currently face and so it seems like rather than more of a problem-solving processes like we just need more uh green tech or more laws within [[nation state]] governments or things like that that there is some deeper analysis of what gives rise to the nature of why our tech causes environmental and social issues or the way we utilize it does and [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] why we don't solve those and what new civilizational capacities might need to be that are adequate to [223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=223.68s)

the scope of the technological capacities that we now are stuck with the effects of and thus have to govern better so someone might hear that and feel the tone you're operating in is a bit pessimistic right what do you say to someone who says well yes we have we have huge problems as a species to [246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=246.879s)

contend with coronavirus being the most current sailing example but look how quickly we came up with a vaccine you know relative to what we thought was possible in the past right are we not is technology just not you know despite some of its side effects clearly you know isn't something going [268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=268.72s)

right if we're able to use technology to come up with a solution to say a global pandemic much more quickly than we thought was possible yeah i would say there are there are many schools of thought but i'll simplify it into kind of two opposing schools of thought when it comes to [291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=291.52s)

technological progress and particularly kind of the exponentiation and technological process that has started happening with the [[industrial revolution]] and then has really picked up since the digital revolution um there is the idea that um technology and capitalism and basically the results of modernity have [313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=313.68s)

uh delivered us from and even longer than that kind of this western idea of the dialectic of progress has made the quality of life continuously better still problems but roughly on the whole better and that any new problem is just the source of the new challenge that human ingenuity will rise to and we'll figure out solutions and and we're problem solving creatures so of course there's always going to be problems but our problem-solving capacity will keep rising and that's as it should be in great and very few people would want to trade places with a previous time in history not knowing what position you'd be born into so we should keep focusing on problems but [348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=348.24s)

in a more kind of optimistic way i would say that's kind of one school highly oversimplified there's another group which is most of the [[existential risk]] world that is looking at the unique issues that ai risk poses that are nothing like the world ever had to face before the unique set of risks that can come [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=367.759s)

from biotech and the ability to engineer self-replicating technology that might be fundamentally incommensurable with the life that is here now and how cheap and distributed that technology is becoming uh you know crispr gene drives being kind of universally available now and so what does it mean to have [385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=385.84s)

distributed catastrophic weapon technology um and the unique set of issues made possible by cyber attacks by [[exponential tech]] mediated disinformation campaigns uh nanotech et cetera and then also eight billion people and the cumulative effects of externality and unrenewable use of [408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=408.8s)

resource and pollution that are hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and the collision of all of this and that there is a [[existential risk]] landscape unlike anything the world ever looked at or tended to the founding fathers didn't have to think of these things even the [[bretton woods]] world didn't have to think of these things um and that it seems like there's pretty [428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=428.16s)

much no way we could make it through because if you look at the way humans have been historically pick any empire pick any kind of time period and say give people that use power that way exponentially more power where they either directly use it to harm others in war or [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=447.759s)

use in ways that indirectly and maybe even unintentionally cause harm to environments or externalities in some way and let's just exponentiate externality or exponentiate war we just don't seem like good enough stewards of that much power and this is why most of the sci-fi is dystopian is it's actually hard to come up with [467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=467.12s)

pro-topian sci-fi where you think about people that are like the people we have been that have that much decentralized power that don't blow everything up even accidentally so then you say well if it's not decentralized then that's a different fail state and that goes kind of orwellian autocratic so i would [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=485.919s)

say both of these are schools of looking at the novelty of the tech space that we have and the relationship of that with the dynamics of how we have made choices and both you know individual [[conflict theory]] group [[conflict theory]] those types of things um if i was to say let's step back and look at both of those because they there's truth in both of those narratives uh really important truth about those narratives you can see really good argumentation from people you've had on stephen pinker and kind of kurzweil diamandis on one camp [523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=523.039s)

you can go talk to nick bostrom uh or ellie eiser yukowski or you know others on that camp um and you know and you can see that it's become a more popular conversation recently not just in academic circles with folks like elon musk saying ai risk is the number one biggest risk to the world and that [547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=547.68s)

ai has passed the point of our ability to probably prevent it becoming an [[existential risk]] so neural link is a hope to find a solution by the necessity of merging us with ai like that's now part of a popular conversation um music what i would say is if we take a long [567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=567.6s)

arc on human history and we say homo sapiens have been around for a few hundred thousand years and the thing that we call civilization has been around for something like 10 000 years we only got the possibility of global [[catastrophic risk]] in world war ii for the first time self-induced human tech induced global [[catastrophic risk]] and that's world war ii seems like a long time ago for people who were born after it where it's just history but you know it's a sliver of a moment an evolutionary time right and that was the first time and it is important to get that when we look at previous civilizations none of them still exist in the form [605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=605.76s)

that they were when they were a major empire whatever the the roman empire the egyptian the maya and the aztec or whatever it's actually it is the precedent that civilization itself end up falling and mostly through [[self-terminating]] processes they end up having internal infighting overwhelm their ability to [625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=625.04s)

defend their boundaries well or they actually environmentally outstripped their environments and then went through collapse dynamics so it's just whenever you had a civilization fall previously it was a local issue right there was a local civilization with a boundary and there were lots of [642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=642.16s)

other civilizations around it world war ii we got a weapon that we couldn't really viably use in war recognizing that multiple sides would use it and have anybody win it was the first time of having a really unwinnable war and the ability to actually destroy the biosphere's ability to support life if we used it so i would say if people aren't paying [663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=663.92s)

enough attention to how bright a light bright align that is of everything before and everything after like it's really important to get that because before that when you study history so much of the history you study is the history of major kingdoms or empires warring with each other and after that the major empires can't [682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=682.8s)

war and make it through so we have to come up with some solution other than war and so the bread and woods world the post-world war ii how do we figure this out world said okay nation-state governments aren't enough to prevent world war we realize that we gotta we realized that world war one made the [700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=700.24s)

league of nations it wasn't strong enough so we've got to make a stronger thing we'll make a united nations but we also have to make these other inter-governmental organizations a world bank and imf a set of uh trade treaties and let's make it to where there's so much economic interdependence across the nations that it's more profitable to do [719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=719.36s)

trade with each other than it is to war and where the [[supply chain|supply chains]] are such that almost everything we use comes from six continents so if we blow somebody else up it messes up our own [[supply chain|supply chains]] and it binds us it binds the [[game theory]] to be more useful to cooperate than it is to war so then that enters a new phase and also one of the key things in that [739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=739.12s)

[[bretton woods]] world was it will allow us the application of these vast industrial technologies across the whole world coordinating the division of labor across it that we can increase global gdp growth much faster so everybody every nation whatever can increase its wealth without having to take it from somebody else [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=761.279s)

and if you have to take it from someone else because you don't have a positive sum game the negative sum game or zero-sum games go uh rivalrous faster that was the idea but then fast forward 75 years and we didn't have major empires war we had a cold war we had proxy wars and we go from having a major part of that was mediated by [781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=781.76s)

that there was only one type of catastrophic weapon that couldn't be used and there were only two superpowers that had it so you could do [[mutually assured destruction]] they could monitor and have that set up with ai weapons with cyber weapons on infrastructure targets with uh bio nano et cetera and other things we now have dozens of catastrophic weapons that dozens of actors including non-state actors have we can't put mutual sure destruction on a system like that so that whole system that kind of kept us safe after world war ii can't keep doing that [818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=818.56s)

and we got so much we got such a complicated global [[supply chain]] through globalization that we got to see with kovid like one part of the world shuts down because of a local issue and you get cascading failures across the whole world and that was still a relatively small issue and so then we start to look at the fragility dynamics that come from that [837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=837.92s)

as opposed to have uh you know local collapse stay local when the whole system is radically interconnected you also get fragility dynamics and then we're also hitting because of that positive some gdp happening through unrenewable extraction of resources humans utilizing them and then turning [855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=855.519s)

them into trash you can't run an exponential linear [[materials economy]] on a finite planet long term so we're also hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] not just [[climate change]] but [[species extinction]] overfishing of the oceans plastics [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the oceans blah blah so many things like that [870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=870.8s)

so we're now kind of at the end of the [[bretton woods]] world where we can't do [[mutually assured destruction]] the fragility is too high we can't keep positive sub growth dynamics with linear [[materials economy]] and yet we also can't go back to the previous thing where we wore with catastrophic war tech and so it's like what is next so what i [892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=892.56s)

would say is that the tech space does make a change in quantity right like basically a nuke is just a way bigger sphere and if you want to think of it very fundamentally in terms of like there's some in-group out group dynamics and some ability to use kinetic weapons to advance capacities but at a certain point changes in quantity become changes in quality or changes in type meaning the same type of governance no longer works and so what i would say is that we have had changes in magnitude of issues and speed rate of issues such that the previous governance capacities whether we're talking about [933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=933.12s)

markets governments igos whatever aren't adequate to the scope of them and that doesn't mean nothing could be it means we have to innovate in the [[social tech]] space of what is the [[social tech|social technology]] that is adequate to govern the amount of power that [[physical tech|physical technology]] gives us yeah so what i've just heard you say in [950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=950.56s)

summary is that there was essentially a break in history at world war ii for the purposes of of this topic and that related to the technology of nuclear weaponry but now we're we're facing a world that's even one notch scarier than that in that we're facing problems similar to [976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=976.88s)

what we face with nuclear weaponry but on all fronts on the [[artificial intelligence]] front on the biotech front and those problems are actually quite a bit tougher epistemologically because nuclear nuclear bombs are fairly easy to understand relative to for example the problem of [1002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1002.32s)

[[artificial intelligence]] in the abstract right we really don't know even the smartest people who spent spend all their time worrying about this still don't really know what [[artificial intelligence]] is gonna look like a hundred years from now um but you know the problem of just brute force violence is rather right like you can make a nuclear [1027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1027.839s)

bomb that's a thousand times as powerful as the most powerful one that exists now and i understand the nature of that threat right it's just i just picture an explosion but bigger right i'm not even sure what to picture exactly with the problem of [[artificial intelligence]] and that makes preempting it that much harder it also makes it more difficult to actually worry about it on an emotional level right it's easy when you're watching a movie and they they they reduce the threat of [[artificial intelligence]] to something personified something intuitively scary to humans like killer robots or you know you know it's [1072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1072.0s)

just a anthropomorphization of the problem of [[artificial intelligence]] but but the the true threats are are i think abstract uh more abstract than that uh but nevertheless scary um and so where does where does the the idea of [[sensemaking]] and the breakdown of sense-making institutions fit into your your view of the problem yeah uh i want to take one detour first because you actually said something super important about the uh the fact that the bomb is in some ways simpler than the issues that we face right now or at least simpler to imagine or kind of wrap our heads around forecasting [1120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1120.72s)

it's also the case that nuclear bombs are really really hard to make because there's not that many places in the world that have uranium and then it's really hard to enrich uranium and as a result they can't it can't be a just easily distributed technology it takes advanced [[nation state]] level capacity to make it so that you are limiting the number of agents that can play with this thing and you can also monitor them so the agents that can mess with it can spy on each other and so you can start to have something like [[mutually assured destruction]] be a little bit easier because it's so hard [1156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1156.24s)

to make them right and so the where the uranium mines where is the stuff going radioactive tracers that kind of thing when we start talking about putting a thermite bomb on a homemade drone homemade termite bomb or whatever and it can happen in a garage or cyber attacks on infrastructure targets this is now what can happen in a [1175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1175.6s)

basement thing it's very different so having catastrophic tech that is not that hard to make that is decentralizable is very different that's one thing also when there's just one type of catastrophic tech maybe there's different delivery [1193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1193.28s)

mechanisms it can come from a sub or a plane or whatever but it's one type the mitigation strategies or or the prevention of war strategies are different than when you have multiple different types and they're the forecasting of how could one of these get first attack without triggering the other ones becomes nearly impossible to figure out so it's actually really worth thinking through all of that and and if you read say a book like the doomsday machine by daniel ellsberg daniel's still alive you should get him on your show it would be actually really incredible to have him on your show if he hasn't been yet and talk about how many times we went [1230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1230.159s)

into countdown sequence based on complete computer glitches or errors during mutual destruction and how like kind of fantastic it is that we're here at all um you also think about okay so so making nukes was actually a pretty hard thing to do figuring out how to split atoms but um yeah it's still less complicated [1250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1250.0s)

than the other type of tech and the tech mitigation we're talking about but notice what the manhattan project was right it was let's get all the best minds in the world let's create an unlimited black budget figure this thing out we don't have something like a manhattan [1266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1266.88s)

project tending to the [[existential risk|existential risks]] of today and we have something like at best little bitty academic orgs like this cambridge center for the city of [[existential risk]] or the oxford future of humanity institute that have nowhere near that kind of concentration of brain trust national support funding whatever [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1287.6s)

um so that's another big thing of like what why is it that society can't coordinate adequately to recognize a major risk and be able to give the adequate degree of investment needed because if you want to take that argument that as we get new problems we get better problem solving capacity we can say well the last biggest set of problems we had [1308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1308.08s)

was way smaller than these and had way more problem solving capacity put towards it so what's going on there is that important one thing to think about is the role of the politicization of information and how that makes everything more difficult to solve so for instance i remember [1330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1330.4s)

in march of 2020 early march when the first coveted numbers the the fatality rate numbers were just coming out from various parts of the world and we were all looking at those cruise ships and wondering what exactly the disease we were dealing with i remember at the time [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1355.2s)

reading articles about you know sort of trying to piece together a picture of what this disease was and having no semblance of a worry in my mind that the article was distorted by political bias in either direction because we hadn't yet decided who was on what side of the covet issue there were no sides yet they were not [1381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1381.12s)

drawn you know there were people worrying for instance that trump was going to use a kind of alarmism about kovid to institute the authoritarian policies that he's always wanted to institute from the beginning and uh forced the whole nation into lockdown [1400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1400.96s)

right that was a plausible idea that or worry that many people had that's how and that's i i only say that just to show that people really did not know where the left and the right were going to come down on this issue and i remember the feeling of of relief just knowing that i can read an article and about a extremely important topic [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1424.48s)

and not worry that that political bias is really infecting it in either direction and and even then the epistemological problems of figuring out what is true were immense right is the is the fatality rate zero point one percent or five percent right like that's the question people were asking [1445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1445.6s)

at that time and it was a very difficult question now you know fast forward a month the political lines have been drawn and now you have to devote you know brain space when you're watching tv or reading an article to trying to trying to unspin it because now we've [1468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1468.0s)

we've just imported all of the machinery of toxic partisanship and [[confirmation bias]] and and everything into this issue right and i could palpably feel the shift and it occurred to me you know how much better off would we be if we could treat every problem in civilization if we could treat [[climate change]] and ai particularly [[climate change]] like coronavirus in the first week before it was politicized so you know where does the politicization of of information fit into this problem for you yeah i mean it's it's pretty central um when we talk about governance and the original thesis that we need [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1515.039s)

fundamentally better types of governance for the scale and magnitude of consequentiality and speed of the types of things we're governing on today uh governance is about coordinated choice making how to especially if it's not autocratic if it's going to be a democracy or a public or an [[open society]] of some kind how do we coordinate choice making across a lot of different people businesses agents and our choice making is uh informed by both our [[sensemaking]] and our values our [[meaning making]] so what do we think is actually going on and what do we think a solution to what's going on might look like what will the effect of that thing [1556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1556.0s)

be so that's both [[sensemaking]] and then forecasting and then the meaning of the values generation is what is it that we care about that we're trying to make a choice in the service of and so if we want anything like an [[open society]] we have to be able to coordinate our sense-making and our values with each other to be [1574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1574.72s)

able to have something like coordinated choice making emerge and so that means that we have to have something like an epistemic comment right at commons where we can make sense of things together and we're oriented to be able to have clear [[sensemaking]] together and we see that that isn't happening and there's a number of historical reasons why that isn't happening we can see that the [[fourth estate]] has undergone massive erosion for a number of reasons as has the quality of education relative to training citizens to be able to have adequate civic engagement for the complexity of the issues we face so this is actually kind of a important [1616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1616.88s)

point if we step back a little bit is we say well what do what is the role of education for any civilization the role of education is that for that civilization there's different ways we can talk about it this is not the only meaningful way but one meaningful way for that civilization to continue to function there's a lot of tasks that [1639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1639.6s)

have to happen there's a lot of knowledge and problem solving capacities and so the role of education is to be able to train up new generations and and have intergenerational knowledge transfer of everything that is needed for the tasks of that society to be able to happen and so you can think of it as a kind of [1656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1656.08s)

uh social transmission or social autophilesis but in an [[open society]] as opposed to a closed society if we if we have a some type of autocracy everyone doesn't have to be engaged in the choice making of the society as a whole they just have to be able to carry out a labor function or whatever [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1679.279s)

specific function within that they have if we have an [[open society]] where people are supposed to be engaged in a in a governance process foreign by the people which means that the choices that are happening at the macro scale of that nation or whatever group it is they have to be able to understand well enough to contribute to [1697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1697.44s)

the choice making of then the education in that society has to not just prepare them for their role in the market or the workforce but also prepare them for their role as a citizen to be able to engage in governance and so whether i'm voting on a proposition or whether i'm voting on a representative is going to vote on a proposition do i understand the [1715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1715.36s)

propositions and the pros and cons well enough of what the doe has to do with regard to the grid and energy policy or what the dod has to do with regard to military capacity dude there's a big educational load required there's a larger educational load required to develop citizens capable of doing [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1733.52s)

[[open society]] and you know i think i think people can understand why the idea of democracy is actually a kind of radical idea which is the idea that you can have some very large number of people most of whom will never meet each other who have different life experiences and want different things in different world [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1755.679s)

views different religions that are all going to somehow coordinate together effectively to run something like shared infrastructure as opposed to have a king or a parliament or some small group of people do it or a tribe where everybody coordinates together but it's a small number of people where everyone can be in a single [1774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1774.0s)

conversation everybody can know each other and compromising for people that you know is a different creature and this is why modern democracies emerged following the enlightenment of modernity and the idea that there was some basis by which we could all come to make sense of the world together the philosophy of science and the [1790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1790.559s)

hegelian dialectic we could all independently come to assess [[base reality]] and come to similar understanding about it and through something like a hegelian dialectic we could understand each other's values and say is there a value or is there a proposition that can meet everybody's values better [1807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1807.12s)

and can there be a recognition that if this thing is not the optimal thing you want it's still better this system as a whole than autocracy or warfare between us separating um so it and and this is where we go back to all the founding founders of the us that the statements that they made like [1827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1827.76s)

i think it was jefferson that said if i could have a perfect newspaper and a broken government or a perfect government in a broken newspaper i would take a perfect newspaper because if the people could all be well educated about what is actually going on in the world they can make a new government if the people aren't well educated they [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1843.44s)

can't possibly be engaged in good choice making and so whoever is effective at predatory rule will end up ruling and i think the the quote that is most interesting to me was uh i'm going to paraphrase one of george washington where he said something to the effect of the number one aim of the federal government has to be the comprehensive [1861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1861.76s)

education of every citizen in the science of government and i think it's such a key insight to say the number one aim of the federal government after just fighting revolutionary war is not to protect its boundaries and after creating a government as opposed to a pure laissez-faire market so that it could institute rule of law [1879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1879.44s)

the number one name wasn't even rule of law because you can protect your boundaries effectively with a military dictatorship and you can uh institute rule of law well with a dictatorship but if it's truly going to be a democracy if every citizen isn't comprehensively educated into the science of government [1897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1897.44s)

everything that they would need to understand to participate in governing well and the civic virtue to actually do so it's not going to stay a democracy and we can see for a bunch of reasons how both uh the educational system and the [[fourth estate]] that would mediate their ongoing informantness have decayed to a place that [1916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1916.72s)

is nowhere near adequate we don't we don't have anything like government up for and by the people people don't understand most anything government is engaging in nor could they or are they particularly oriented to it so the idea of a republic is mostly not even a good simulation anymore it's mostly just a vestigial story and so then the question we have to ask [1934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1934.799s)

is if if we want something like an [[open society]] as opposed to an autocratic society we can see autocracy on the rise in other parts of the world and it actually being more effective at a number of things if we want something like an [[open society]] what would it take to have an [[open society]] coordinate effectively in the presence of these [1953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1953.44s)

types of issues we face and coordinate more effectively than autocratic ones do to not have the world be seated to that structure and at the foundation of what it would take is something like the capacity to have shared [[sensemaking]] across the space and shared values generation to orient towards shared coordination and so then really key becomes what does [1974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1974.96s)

it take to do that what does it take to create a uh systems and a culture that doesn't pollute the [[epistemic commons]] that doesn't culture war that works towards uh communication that has is seeking to bring about shared understanding first rather than subgroups strategic aims [1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=1996.32s)

you know i know some people from china and mostly what they say about political conversations is that they just don't happen right people just for the most part don't discuss it there's just a boundary on what topics you can talk about and within that boundary you feel quite free in fact and [2132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2132.64s)

in some sense freer than americans are are to speak but there just is a hard and fast boundary about what you can talk about in polite conversation and that that's a that boundary is more or less chose chosen by by the communist party right so that doesn't exist in america [2152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2152.32s)

uh obviously to the extent that there are boundaries on what you can talk about in polite conversation those boundaries are imposed from the bottom up in some sense or at minimum not from the government from the the elite right by elite queues and by sort of the consensus of people with a certain [2176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2176.4s)

status that have blue check marks on twitter and and so forth uh and the the related problem is that in many european countries they are premised on the notion of a single ethnicity with shared values and certain problems don't arise in that context right the the problem is in europe has been that [2205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2205.28s)

different you know different nations go to war with one another and to the extent that nations go to war within themselves different ethnic groups that has in many cases been solved by simply creating nations that have one ethnicity with one religion so there a substantial set uh set of a [2227](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2227.28s)

substantial body of agreement about values to begin with right there's a kind of unity and then in the case of china where that unity is is sort of imposed by from from the top down right so those are two ways if you you can get to unity through autocracy or through just forming a nation that already has a [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2250.0s)

substantial amount of unity to begin with because it's it's the nation is a natural outgrowth of what was once an actual tribe of people and then in america you have a totally different case where we have freedom we don't have autocracy but we are extremely far from a single [2270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2270.24s)

tribe right we're we're lots of different tribes with uh deep disagreement on values and and that's a problem that is very difficult to see how we make progress on and it seems in my lifetime i've only seen it get worse as a result [2297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2297.119s)

of [[social media]] and you know the way we consume information now where you just get a personalized menu of events and opinions that are perfectly crafted so as to either confirm what you already believe or give you the worst impression of what the other side thinks about an issue [2326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2326.72s)

so that you can dismiss them entirely and on various measures of polarization this problem has been been getting worse and so it is a deep question to ask uh how do we update democracy for the 21st century for for a 21st century multi-ethnic nation that is committed to freedom and doesn't want to become an [2357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2357.359s)

autocracy doesn't want to impose unity from the top down but nevertheless can't fall back on what works in other places that are also free which is just having a sort of natural unity oh man you touched like eight different things that be nice if we can get into i hope we come back and close some of these loops yeah um [2379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2379.599s)

on the [[social media]] thing you mentioned i'm not going to start there but we should come back and double click on it because it's actually really um it's a fundamental part i believe you had tristan harris on recently so we won't repeat that it's a good one for people to listen to i'm i'm imagining but there's a couple pieces in terms of that [2398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2398.96s)

are all of the structures made in modernity were made on broadcast media meaning uh some central broadcastability through a newspaper through following the [[printing press]] which then turned into radio which then turned into television which meant we could make sure everybody got similar messages and so as soon as we [2415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2415.92s)

moved to a decentralized kind of media where everybody could broadcast and then there's way more uh answers than anyone can possibly look at so then whoever controls the search algorithm or the recommendation algorithm is actually curating the information space that's actually not just a change in magnitude that's a change in type that's a change [2437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2437.52s)

in type in a very fundamental way the nature of the technological uh infrastructure that is mediating civilization changing and then the new civilization the [[social tech]] needing to change and having not changed yet so that's a big one i'd like to come back to but the most fundamental thing that you said [2460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2460.56s)

is you can see examples where there is a certain kind of order that doesn't seem super top-down imposed it seems more bottom-up or kind of culturally supported where there is some kind of depth of shared culture that creates enough binding energy to overcome the cleaving energy between the differences of the people [2481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2481.839s)

you can think about what's going to hold a number of people together being a ratio of the cleaving and binding energy of that population right and when we study the history of sapiens we can see that for the most part for a few hundred thousand years the groups never got beyond a certain size right famously the [[dunbar number]] and it's a big question as to why like what but we see this in all other animals right like chimpanzee troops are of a certain size they get a little bit bigger and then they end up cleaning and it similarly has to do with uh where does the bonding energy between them provide enough benefits to overcome the cleaving energy between you know competing interests but the fact that there's something like 200 000 plus years of human activity and with brains similar to the brains that we have that never got above 150 people it's like oh there's something very deep there to look at and this is why many social philosophers talk about [2541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2541.359s)

the fundamentally tribal nature of humans from an evolutionary bio standpoint and why it's important to understand that there's a lot of ways we can think about the [[dunbar number]] one way is up to that number of people i can know everyone very well i can know everyone intimately and we can actually all sit around we can [2560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2560.96s)

all participate in a single conversation we can have a tribal council where if there's a big decision to make everybody's voice could be heard within just literally mediated by the the ability to speak and everybody hear it without a microphone or tech of some kind and the time that it takes for all the [2579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2579.599s)

voices to be heard to actually make a decision and so if i'm going to live in a society where i'm going to be subjugated to the choices or be responsible to mediate the choices i want to have a say in it if we start to get to a situation where there's so many people that can't all have a say then why would i just not cleave and go make a smaller group [2596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2596.88s)

so then the question of why did we start when did the [[dunbar number]] end mostly has to do with a time period around the beginning of agriculture movement from hunter-gatherer largely nomadic cultures to agriculture and a number of critical changes that occurred around then but some of them have to do with up till that point human populations would in [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2618.96s)

the population would actually outstrip the resource of an area and then they would move and so you'd get this migration and this is why we can see that humans wherever they started ended up becoming [[apex predator|apex predators]] across every single environment on the planet where no other animal did that right like that's a very uniquely human thing [2639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2639.52s)

because we could make ourselves adapted to different environments through tools clothes and other kinds of tools once population starts to outstrip an area and you can't move anymore because we've done all the moving that's possible then tribal warfare becomes an obligate situation to deal with resource scarcity once any group starts tribal warfare all the other ones have to do it in an [2660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2660.4s)

obligate way or they die by default and so now you start getting a tribal warfare race right a kind of multipolar arm trap or [[arms race]] and so now it makes sense for two smaller groups to unify together because they have more binding energy which is they're going to die on their own and so i'm willing to give up some of my uh my choice making freedom i'm willing to be a part of a group i don't have as much a say in because the group that i have more say in on my own is going to die from some larger militarized group now as soon as that group gets larger than the other group gets larger they both increase their weaponry they increase [2696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2696.0s)

their ability to do division of labor and coordinate and stores of resources and those types of things and we call that kind of the evolution of empire um so it's important to understand that the and and this is actually why you know when machiavelli talks about the enemy hypothesis that the idea that humans are tribal and they will keep breaking down to smaller tribal scales unless there is a unifying force and the unifying force is almost always an enemy it doesn't have to be but there's actually social theory argument on this i would say it doesn't have to be um but generally what will unify a group of people together with a shared identity [2736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2736.079s)

involves what is outside of that identity that needs them to be bound together and so um so yeah this is an important idea is that you can have a shared identity which we call a culture that has everybody kind of police each other or um create order with each other in a in a distributed way [2759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2759.76s)

and so that when we look at japan or singapore or the nordic countries and look at the relatively lower crime higher education etc and try to apply that to some huge diverse country like the us we can see that they have certain cultural prerequisites in place we don't have that's that's like a hard and really [2778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2778.48s)

important problem and it's why there are some people who are proponents of the idea the us actually needs to break up into some smaller entities that can have more cultural uh homogeneity i think that is a definitely impossible way to do it because all of the states say we tried to [2794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2794.88s)

separate it into a red nation and a blue nation or whatever subsets of nations all the states have nukes none of the forces in europe or whatever when we were dealing with kind of european rise did and so do you want groups that have so much uh enmity and antipathy with each other [2811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2811.92s)

that they can't participate together and have to cleave both having nukes with no defensible airspace in between them sharing a border like that's a there's a problematic situation to think about so you either get order because of some shared cultural basis or you get ordered because it's imposed or you don't get order and you get chaos [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2831.839s)

and the thing breaks down because of chaos so if we say that civilizations fail either because of too much chaos or order that comes the wrong way through imposition those are the two different failure modes so what we need is emergent order the emergent order actually has to be at the level of culture before being at the [2850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2850.4s)

level of institution it has to be ultimately the fact that humans are making choices based on what they value and their and what they care about and how they make sense of the world and if it is not if the order is not arising from within them it's imposed on them and then that imposition has to be mediated by a monopoly of violence of [2868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2868.64s)

some kind and becomes its own failure state so the question of how do we get emergent order in a situation like the u.s and some or or the globe if we want to think about where we have authentically global issues that we need to coordinate on because no country can deal with ocean [[dead zone|dead zones]] or [[species extinction]] or [[climate change]] or [[exponential tech]] media risk on its own how do you get emergent order between people that have very different histories and different conditioning i that's one way of framing what i would say is like the essential question we have to figure [2907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2907.44s)

out right now yeah so i want to zero zero in on this this idea of the us breaking into smaller countries or but not as a serious suggestion but as a tool for thinking about what some of the problems are so if if you for instance take the idea of been in the news lately [2930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2930.72s)

and defined last summer of the police killing unarmed u.s citizens particularly african americans and consider how important the raw size of the united states is to this particular problem to to a problem that results in riots and lives lost and businesses destroyed and so forth consider if america were identical in [2956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2956.8s)

every respect but the size of canada roughly one-tenth the size by population that just means any bad thing related to one person harming another would happen one-tenth as often right just there are if there are say 40 unarmed americans killed every year than just you know there are four in [2986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=2986.0s)

this hypothetical version of america that's just one tenth the size right so it's just four stories a year as opposed to 40 and just fewer opportunities per unit time to become outraged about something and the the important thing here is that anything that happens anywhere in america feels like it happens here in the [3016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3016.64s)

relevant sense right so if something happens a thousand miles away in a different state that can cause a riot outside my apartment right because it is conceptually it happened here in the sense that is relevant for the rest of americans and so many of the problems we face are if not a direct result but [3040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3040.0s)

then exacerbated by the size of the country right we're trying to do something in this country that has never been done before which is have a a population of a third of a billion people uh that are not culturally the same we've had for all intents and purposes open borders longer than any other nation has ever [3066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3066.319s)

tried to have open borders for and i'm speaking not about our current immigration policy but about the long the long run u.s history right we let we let europe come in in the 19th century and until the 1920s or so and then since 1965 we've pretty much let the world come in relative to at least border policies in other nations such as japan and china and so forth and so we're trying to have a massive country we're trying to have a country that relative to most nations on earth has a very liberal border policy we're trying to be a nation of immigrants um and immigrants from very different [3112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3112.16s)

places with very different values from one another and we're also trying to have no autocracy and freedom right so this is a very difficult problem it's a problem most countries have haven't even approached with a 10-foot pole because they'd be so worried about the [3134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3134.0s)

results right and it's obviously a problem it's a challenge that we suffer from in in many ways um it's also i think a challenge we should feel proud for attempting however imperfectly because most places on earth have just not attempted it they've said well  it we're just going to close the [3158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3158.0s)

borders we're not even going to try um and we're going to remain a certain size which is which is fine it's just that um you know often you know it's it's one thing for someone to look at the the social the problems of divisiveness facing america right now from a different country and wonder what the [3178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3178.319s)

hell is going on here but i think it's crucial to recognize the context that we're trying something that most places simply don't try for good reason but uh you know it occurs to me a country like singapore which you mentioned the way that they deal with race relations there is just totally [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3200.96s)

different right they have obviously it's it's a city state and it's many ways not analogous but they have three major ethnicities there and they have a quota system where they actually from the top down don't allow residential segregation right they don't allow you know you cannot have a situation there like you have in new york with hasidic jews for instance all living in one neighborhood or with blacks and whites uh heavily clustered in certain neighborhoods because they don't allow it they enforce integration by policy and that they found that that's a stable equilibrium but [3245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3245.599s)

you know whether or not that would work in america is a moot point because it could never be done right we have a culture we have a taste for freedom here culturally for not being told you know where you can and can't live that people in other places of the world simply don't have right if you never had freedom in democracy there's nothing [3267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3267.44s)

built in i think to the human spirit that necessarily favors it um so i chalk that all up to you as as uh elements to think about uh in this problem is there anything in there that you want to react to when you say what we're trying to do here is novel so of course we have some [3293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3293.44s)

novel problems and yet the problems are the result of um of a meaningful set of intents and experiment i wouldn't even say there was a clear set of intents right because when you look at the number of people who were here at the time of the founding of the nation and if you even look at in those writings with the forecast of the most people that would ever come about it was it was nothing like what has what has happened so the intent has been a kind of evolutionary force over this time period and for instance when you think about the ideas in early formation of the [3339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3339.44s)

united states democracy the town hall was a central idea and the idea that the people who locally lived in an area were largely affecting each other more than anything else because transportation was slow and communications were slow and the total population was small enough that everybody could pretty much fit into a town hall and be part of a conversation so civic duty was not mostly voting on a representative it was actually being able to be in a situation where the sense-making that anyone had could be heard someone was like no that's not the situation i've been out on the border here's what's going on everyone's tense making could be heard [3376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3376.96s)

and rather than just getting to vote on a pre-crafted proposition where both voting for it is good for some things and damages other things which is why almost every proposition gets half of the vote almost no propositions get 90 of the voters because they're almost all based on theory of trade-offs that seem beneficial to some subset of things and [3393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3393.599s)

harmful to another but nobody was involved in crafting the proposition outside of usually some special interest group that wasn't even trying to look at how does this benefit everyone that was actually alien to the core idea of why democracy might work the idea of why it might work is can we actually have a conversation [3410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3410.4s)

first to come up with what everybody thinks is going on and what matters to come up with a proposition in a real-time conversation that seems like the best proposition that meets everybody's needs simultaneously and then voting is a last step if we can't all just come to a shared agreement that that makes sense [3426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3426.16s)

uh as a way of sublimating the the rivalry or warfare so as soon as you get to too much scale and you can't do that anymore then you have to over depend on representatives then the people who are representing are have their own set of interests they become and as it gets to a larger and larger [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3444.96s)

scale almost no representative is really talking with the people in a meaningful way and so whose interests are they representing the idea that the state is going to institute law that allows the market to do the good things the market does but it where there's unhealthy market incentive uh predatory aspects there's going to be [3464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3464.96s)

rule of law that binds it you can only have a state buying the market if the people are binding the state otherwise you end up getting regulatory capture and we can see that that has happened across the board well how do the people bind the state when it gets to that big of a size and there's that much information that [3481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3481.28s)

much complexity we can't all fit into a town hall and um that's a that's a fundamental question we can see that some of the founding thoughts on why we need representatives had to do with who rides a horse from this area to meet with the other town halls and figure out what the state's going to do and it's like so when we see what [3502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3502.4s)

audrey tang has done in taiwan with working on creating a digital democracy someone else would be fantastic for your show she hasn't been on can we create a town hall can we use the kinds of [[exponential tech]] that facebook and youtube are using that end up destroying democracy could we use them [3521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3521.52s)

to mediate democracy where we were able to actually have everyone be well educated on the issues we're able to assess do these people even can they state the pros and cons on a specific proposition so it doesn't have to show leaning it just shows that there's actual understanding of these of the issues before they vote on it is [3538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3538.16s)

there ways for them to vote directly on things are there ways to be able to track what representatives are doing and uh the financial accounting and the relationships between uh the commercial sector and the uh state better and this is this is where i'm saying um the radical increase in scale in particular [3558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3558.64s)

debased some of the ideas upon which democracy seemed like it would even make sense or be possible so now you have to rethink how do how do we have everyone be educated enough about the issues and be able to understand the other positions on the issues well enough and participate in proposition creation not just uh choice making on the proposition that is bad yes or no um how do we redo that utilizing the digital technologies and other new technologies we have that both make it more consequential to do that and also possible well yeah i guess there's a fundamental problem [3606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3606.319s)

which is that much of the peop much of the reason people are interested in issues is because those issues are terrain in a in a battle that exists right the analogy i sometimes think of is people get into sports usually first through rooting for a team and then through learning about the [3633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3633.76s)

sport becoming interested in the sport because they care about one side winning in a war it's it's a rarer person who first gets interested in baseball neutral to who wins and then only later begins rooting for a particular team right so much of the reason people want to become educated about any particular issue is because it's already terrain in the culture war that they can fight for right people first look for the fight and then get want to get informed in the context of the fight which is totally natural i'm not claiming to to be exempt from this you know this this is something i [3679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3679.92s)

experience in my own psychology and i see in in society in general and other people and so it's easy for me to be pessimistic about the possibility of finding a tech-based solution to a problem that seems inherent in our psychology can you talk me out of that pessimism [3708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3708.48s)

so the question you bring up is a kind of real politic critique or question of is [[human nature]] inexorably the thing we're up against uh so if you read machiavelli we read the 48 laws of power or anything that is kind of doing or a real politic assessment of uh patterns of human behavior historically [3732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3732.799s)

the argument can be made that humans are intrinsically and maybe there's a gaussian distribution based on their genetics or their whatever it is some something of how much of this but that as a the distribution as a whole humans are either innately too irrational or too rivalrous or both to be able to have something [3754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3754.88s)

like adequate [[sensemaking]] and adequate integrative values to be able to have an emergent order and culture beyond an n group that is unified against an outgroup right that would be the the question that we are kind of bound to if there isn't a big enough out group we will never be able to get the binding [3778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3778.64s)

energy we will go tribal on each other and this is one of the arguments about one of the things that happened in the u.s obviously the u.s has had rivalry for a long time the civil war was a good example there'd been plenty of examples across partisanship or class or race or region or but um but we can also see that there was a kind of patriotism and reunification uh associated with world war ii and for a little while afterwards and when we look at the intensity of partisanship in the u.s today where even when i was a kid the senators on the floor that would be arguing with each other would go out to lunch together afterwards and that doesn't [3821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3821.68s)

happen it's like what happened in that time period part of it has to do with the [[social media]] thing part of it has to do with things that occur in broadcast media there's there's a number of things one of the arguments that many people brought up is that it intensified after the soviet union [3836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3836.16s)

collapsed and the wall came down in the end of the cold war because the cold war created a binding energy for the us to all be on the same side adequately against a threatening enough external enemy and that when it came down and china didn't look anything like it does today and they didn't have and russia didn't even have putin yet organizing them in a [3855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3855.68s)

more strategic way there wasn't a big enough enemy to unify the u.s against itself the us was the number one biggest force and the number two number three biggest force that the left and right turned against each other as the kind of largest source of energy to extract um or predatory advantage to incur and then that has continued as china has moved into a total different position and that's occurring in other parts of the world uh so there's this question of can people be unified at a scale much larger than tribal without an external enemy or is that innate to us and we can see jane goodall's and jimmy carter's and martin luther kings and carl sagans and [3899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3899.039s)

people that seem to have a more universal ethic and there's a question of is that conditionable across a population widely or those people naturally outliers for some reason will always be outliers and trying to think about conditioning qualities like that more widely is falling um eric weinstein and i had a conversation [3924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3924.88s)

a couple years ago on his podcast and this was like the heart of the thing that we talked about because he and i had a fairly similar assessment of the [[catastrophic risk]] landscape that [[exponential tech]] under current kinds of rivalrous international governance creates and we each had a thought on how to [3945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3945.119s)

overcome that and they were different and he made a joke that was fun as he's like well i think your solution requires changing [[human nature]] but i'll indulge you on that because mine requires breaking the speed of light and his solution was no i i think we are too rivalrous we have to be able to have [3966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3966.4s)

civilizations work that have some intrinsically shared value base if they're too close to someone else that doesn't have enough shared value based they won't care and if they they will end up wanting the other one's resource at a certain point so we need to be able to inhabit planets that are far enough apart that war [3981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3981.92s)

war is unfeasible and like you can see how someone smart thinking well about these things could be like well maybe that's the case right maybe that is actually a necessary thing and i don't know if my sense of it is will end up being right because obviously we don't [3999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=3999.359s)

we don't have the basis to be able to say that much certainty but i'll tell you why i think it is one of the post-modern critiques of modernity that was right is that the idea that there is an unbiased objective assessment of the world is uh is dangerous that when we're doing um because [4022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4022.64s)

in a complex situation which things i picked to measure even if i'm measuring and repeating measurement and getting it right not messing that up anywhere just by cherry-picking out of the data of a very large set or even picking what i do the science to measure on i can get something that is quote-unquote true but [4040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4040.48s)

not representative and then argue as if it's representative or decontextualize the facts or um or lake off frame the interpretation that there's a pragmatics in addition to the kind of semantics and that we can see this more in the social sciences where there's increased complexity with the whole early social science in the u.s of [4060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4060.839s)

why uh why blacks were a genetically lower race than the us unless the declaration of independence didn't pertain to them and yet we weren't morally corrupt or the science of phrenology or things like that and be like yeah that was that was just political vested interest gibberish [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4081.599s)

guiding itself in something that sounded sciencey and it's not anything like real objective science well i think the answer isn't you throw out science and say that there is no way to come to truth because if that's the case all there is is power and then we're actually stuck in that thing we need to just correct for it so we [4102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4102.239s)

don't say that anyone can be unbiased but we say we can seek bias correction we can seek to be able to take all of the perspectives well not just performatively but really seek to inhabit them and then seek to identify where there's true signal and seek to synthesize them and so is it possible to do bias [4119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4119.759s)

correction better towards shared sense-making that never has a hundred percent confidence but an increasingly well epistemically grounded confidence so the reason i say this is because a lot of the social science that we have i think is problematic in this way i think it's after um the thing called empire and then even [4143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4143.839s)

the thing called industrial evolution and capitalism had taken over which was not the evolutionary history of humans in mostly tribal environments and there it created a source of conditioning but it was fairly ubiquitous conditioning and since it was ubiquitous we just said oh this is [[human nature]] and then where we would see something like an indigenous [4164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4164.64s)

tribe that was different it could be thrown out as a statistical outlier so i'm actually very interested in studying statistical outliers to something that is not innate but is ubiquitous conditioning to say what is possible in the in [[human nature]] so specifically i'm interested in positive deviance on the gaussian distribution same [4184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4184.4s)

cultures that have a particular trait that would be desirable more than statistically average and so looking at things like buddhism and jainism and more non-violence based religions buddhism is an interesting example of a number of people that have fluctuated but [4204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4204.719s)

a lot of people 10 million people over a few millennia over different languages and different periods of time that had different economics war etc where the majority of the population all wouldn't hurt bugs and you're like what and didn't mediate war i'm not romanticizing that there were never exceptions but [4225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4225.6s)

compared to most other populations it's like something pretty novel and interesting is happening there and we can see that it's related directly to the ideas of buddhist religion and the nature of how they did conditioning of humans particularly early childhood around non-violence compassion kindness empathy those types [4243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4243.679s)

of things and we can similarly look at areas in liberia or darfur or other places where you have child soldiers where you pretty much aren't going to make it to adulthood without being a murderer is just not a possibility and so i see that [[human nature]] makes almost everyone a murderer or almost [4264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4264.4s)

nobody hurts bugs both possible under the right conditioning environments i see that conditioning people you can't not be conditioning people people are going to learn mandarin or they're going to learn english or they're going to learn uh navajo or whatever language because innate to sapiens and this is really [4282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4282.08s)

important to understand the closest relatives to us right like a horses have been standing in 10 or 20 minutes and it takes a human a year it's like that's a really long period of helplessness why are we embryonic or neonas for so long and even our closest relatives like chimpanzees they can hold onto their mom's fur while [4302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4302.08s)

she moves around the first day and we can't even move our head volitionally for three months and it's like okay so why are we so developmentally dependent for so long and then why do we also have this abstract language and abstract understanding of tool-making principle that is unique well because we make tools that modify our environment so much where most other creatures were evolved to be fit to an environment but we would then change the environment to something we didn't evolve to be fit to we have to be able to change ourselves pretty rapidly so i don't want to genetically be oriented to throw spears well if [4341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4341.36s)

throwing spears isn't adaptive anymore and being able to code or text is so i want to come in with not very much code there's some code but the capacity to imprint the new novel environment we're in because we're changing because we're migrating and changing our own environments so conditioning is a bigger deal for [4357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4357.52s)

humans and it is for other things it's unavoidable so then the question is uh and most of the conditioning that we have studied in social sciences post industrialization and all of it that we've been able to study in the historical period was post-empire which was post-tribal warfare and not the actual [[evolutionary environment]] of humans long term and so we have to say okay well within the conditioning environment of obligate warfare humans behave these ways is that the only way humans could behave under any conditioning environment i think it's a very important question when we look at the level of education and uh the yeah the level of education [4394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4394.64s)

on the gaussian distribution of the jewish population it's very different than lots of other populations in the same country those jews are inhabiting and it has to do with certain cultural values that affect how they do child rearing and parenting and culture and school and so then the question of could we develop [4414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4414.8s)

higher rationality and a higher universal ethics and the population largely so that people were actually seeking to understand perspectives other than their own seeking that to be able to inhabit perspectives and the values of other people and then seeking a solution that we could actually coordinate towards [4436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4436.719s)

recognizing that if we just beat the other side unless we beat them completely they don't exist on the planet anymore they don't go away they're still political actors they're pissed off and have more enmity and they're gonna reverse engineer whatever political weapon or economic weapon or narrative weapon or physical weapon we just use and come back so we either bind ourselves to not just war but escalating war in [[arms race]] including cultural [[arms race|arms races]] or we say how do we and and if under [[exponential tech]] that becomes catastrophic which i argue it does then either we figure out how to understand each other and coordinate [4475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4475.04s)

with each other or we move into escalating rivalry that eventually self-terminates so then i would say our capacity to do that is obligate so then is it possible i hope so and i think so we all know how a vpn protects your privacy and security online right well you can now also use a vpn to [4496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4496.0s)

i mean the point you make about the importance of culture is well taken i do worry one thing that's also true which makes it more difficult is that certain cultural memes have advantages over others right like the you know you know there's a reason that outliers are outliers presumably in in the case of the [4606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4606.84s)

buddhists and the the child soldiers while both of those are possible there must be some reason why the moderate alternative of you know neither being so non-violent so as to not want to kill bugs nor being so violent so as to raise your six-year-olds as murderers [4632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4632.88s)

there must be some reason why the moderate approach has outpropagated the extremes in the space of possible ways to raise one's children and presumably uh you know there's something unscalable about the extremes relative to the [4657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4657.92s)

cultural memes that have in fact scaled right okay yes and no if the child soldier situation isn't uh an extreme that's very short-sighted even in terms of rivalry it's not figuring out how to do agriculture so that people can feed themselves well enough that they can grow their population or how to [4683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4683.679s)

advance their technological capacity to do warfare better long-term or whatever so it's just not even doing group rivalry well right uh the non-violent civilizations mostly made it as long as they stayed out of the way of the more violent ones and to some degree if they figured out how to be effective diplomats [4703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4703.92s)

between them so they could offer some uh bible service um but otherwise it's actually a very interesting part of the story is that you know we have the history of those who made it through and those who made it through usually made it through by winning at war some kind of war um [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4718.159s)

maybe economic war maybe cultural war largely kinetic war and so were there cultures that actually provided for a higher quality of life for their people and more harmony with their environment and just didn't make it through warfare but the warfare thing leads to [[arms race]] meaning continuously larger warfare that once you start to get to [4740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4740.0s)

the verticalizing part of that curve itself self-terminates and this is one of the things we can see in evolution is that there are animals where evolution is selecting for something that is adaptive to an environment that's about to end right it's the animal will be adapted in the immediate term that this one just survived better in this environment it [4758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4758.88s)

was better able to reproduce but it's doubling down on certain genetic capacities that if the environment changes the tiny bit it goes extinct and so there is a certain short-sightedness and blindness to that kind of evolution and i would say mimetically even more so than genetically and so there's a lot of things that win [4776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4776.56s)

in the short term meaning they are selected for that self terminate in the long term or not even all that long term and then this becomes one of the big traps that humanity's in is if we want to do the right long-term thing but we can't get everyone to do it and anyone else does the short-term advantage thing that gives them so much advantage [4797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4797.199s)

that they beat us in the medium term how do we avoid that right and this is both the [[arms race]] and the tragedy of the commons if i'm not going to over fish because i want to leave fish fisheries but the where in shared ocean area and anyone else over fishes i can't actually protect the fish right [4816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4816.0s)

i can't protect the fish population of the ocean by not fishing all i'm doing is saying the other people who don't have the same ethic as me end up overfishing they grow their population faster and use their larger population in war against us and so it i'm actually gonna try and get all the fish even though i don't [4832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4832.08s)

need them and i can figure out a better way and actually have to race to get it faster than they do that trap is the thing we actually have to figure out how to overcome and it's the same with don't really want to build ai weapons because the idea of autonomous ai weapons is is a pretty scary bad idea we'll probably all die from that but i certainly don't want to let the other guy get them first and i can't guarantee that they aren't doing it in some secret project so i'm not gonna sign a treaty to not do it or if i sign a treaty i'm gonna assume that they're lying about it in secret so we're also gonna sign it while lying about it and everybody knows that [4867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4867.28s)

so then we all race to build the ai weapon it just increases the risk of existential harm to everybody and this is the this is the great filter hypothesis on um coming into [[exponential tech]] why don't we have more encounters with advanced alien nations one one of the answers to [4887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4887.52s)

the fermi paradoxes uh when they get to this level of tech they pretty much self extinct everywhere they their rivalry within the planet has them used the powerful tech that would be necessary to go interplanetary against each other before they actually get successfully interplanetary maybe that's true maybe it's not true [4907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4907.52s)

it's a it's a fun [[thought experiment]] i would say if we want to make it through that great filter then we have to say how do we have the level of technological power we're developing and be good stewards of it adequately good stewards because if we look at any previous civilization be like they did a lot of [4926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4926.48s)

up things with the power they had in any of them could if we multiply those up things by exponentially more power is that viable what would it take for us to be um to hold the power and so like i'll say it mythopoetically and i'm not i'm not saying it literally i'm not going to train jesus smuggle and just [4947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4947.84s)

mythopoetically if we have the power of gods if you don't have something like the love and wisdom and prudence of gods to guide that that power ends up leading to self-destruct and there's a lot of myths that are you know it's kind of looking along those lines and so [4964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4964.08s)

you were asking will technological solutions work humans have both the capacity our abstraction gave us the capacity for [[physical tech]] because rather than just using a sharp rock we could like a chimp would do we could experience that one rock was sharper than the other and understand [4982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=4982.719s)

why there's an abstract principle called sharpness and we can make something even sharper right that abstraction of principle allowed us to not just use tools but evolve making better tools it's also what allowed abstract language and coordination so technique just ways of doing things abstractly understand better ways of doing things [5000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5000.08s)

applies to [[physical tech]] but also [[social tech]] right a market or an educational system or a culture a religion a government is a [[social tech|social technology]] of how do we have a better way of doing things together i'm saying that the [[exponential tech]] physical [[physical tech]] that we have mandates better [[social tech]] and that we're having more advancement in the [[physical tech]] than we are in the [[social tech]] that the previous types of [[social tech]] are inadequate to hold the power of this [[physical tech]] but this [[physical tech]] also makes possible evolutions in [[social tech]] that weren't possible before so it's both possible and obligated and that when the founders of the us [5042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5042.88s)

were coming up with this system they weren't having to think about ocean [[dead zone|dead zones]] and [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] or catastrophic weapons or facebook creating uh [[hypernormal stimuli]] doubling down on on tribalism and group bias like there's nothing in the constitution that is trying to think about how to solve those problems there is nothing in the scottish enlightenment and the theory of markets that had to deal with those problems there's nothing in marx's critique of it that even had those problems as things or in the brentwood's world it just had the first of the exponential problems um not exponential existential so what i would say is we have a novel problem [5083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5083.04s)

landscape and as a associated with our physical attack be but our [[physical tech]] directed by our [[social tech]] our [[social tech]] needs to make a jump to be able to safely guide our [[physical tech]] and the inquiry around what that is there we need something a lot like the scottish enlightenment or the enlightenment of modernity that was ended up giving rise to not just the us but modern democracies uh as a whole that is thinking through and you know those follow the [[printing press]] and the [[industrial revolution]] and say whoa we had a change in our techno-industrial base that [5121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5121.28s)

is actually debasing those previous principles of our [[social tech|social technology]] so what is the new set of social capacities adequate to this i'm saying we're at a new place where we have to actually have a step function in cultures because if our problems need fundamentally better problem solving [5142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5142.0s)

than we currently have and we haven't argued that yet but explicitly but what i'll basically say is this we define problems typically in a somewhat simple to try to make a tractable way the problem is [[climate change]] and too much co2 the problem is systemic racism and institutions that have these [5162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5162.88s)

policies or whatever it is and then so let's take the co2 situation we can come up with a solution to that narrowly defined problem that ends up externalizing harm to some other thing we can say okay well we can get the co2 down by planting a whole bunch of plants and using nitrogen fertilizer that's going to sequester co2 but the nitrogen [5186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5186.32s)

is going to create nitrogen runoff in [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean faster or we're going to do a carbon tax but only the countries that ratify it um are going to do it and so if the west does and china doesn't and so there's a slowdown in gdp in the west and not in china and china then uses that for [5207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5207.679s)

near-term advantage geopolitically militarily then in trying to solve [[climate change]] we ceded the 21st century to technologically empowered autocracy or whatever so the problem isn't [[climate change]] right the problem is [[climate change]] and the [[dead zone|dead zones]] in oceans and the great game of [5225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5225.84s)

geopolitical power and its relationship to gdp and they're so interconnected that either our current problem solving methods that don't factor that either solve a problem and externalize harm to another problem often that is worse or just increasing the complexity of the problem landscape or somebody else realizes that our [5246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5246.0s)

solution is going to cause some other problem and so they fight us and now we're stuck in political infighting where almost all of the energy goes into just heat and we can't actually implement large-scale solutions if we can't coordinate on them and so how can we find what it is that everybody cares about [5265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5265.92s)

and how the different problems connect adequately to be able to come up with propositions that have the least unnecessary theory of trade-offs are the best synergistic satisfiers that people can coordinate towards i would say that is a that is the minimum set of problem solving adequate to the problem solving landscape that we are coming into i like this distinction you make between [[physical tech]] and [[social tech]] and that helps me understand exactly what the problem is as you state it i'm curious what improved [[social tech]] might look like is there anyone doing work right now concretely that you see and you say well that's a [5311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5311.679s)

step in the right direction or are are you still in the stage of only being able to really envision what a solution would be in the abstract but i'd actually like to give a couple examples of how changes in [[physical tech]] changed [[social tech]] both for the better and the worse historically a couple times because this [5334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5334.56s)

is not actually an abstract idea it's an idea we have a lot of concrete understanding about so then we're being able to apply that to the current landscape music i'm going to just i'm going to give simplified narratives of topics that the top academics debate nuances of so [5353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5353.28s)

there's a lot of nuance in here but i think the points are at least adequately illustrative animal husbandry in agriculture was a massive tech shift right the agricultural revolution was okay rather than doing hunting and gathering we can now create massive surplus of [5372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5372.4s)

grains which are the first really storable thing and that means that we can make it through famines we can grow our populations we can start to get into storage and surplus so we can see that the thing that we call civilization and the development of the plow are very closely related and there's a lot of people that have [5389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5389.92s)

looked at the way that that [[physical tech|physical technology]] preceded changes in the [[social tech]] because until you had surplus you didn't have to deal with the question of who gets the surplus and what is the governance system that that mediates this surplus until you had enough surplus that when someone dies they could actually pass it on [5408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5408.96s)

that all the laws regarding inheritance didn't have to come into play the same way in a very different way than it would have been in a tribal setting so there's lots of things that the [[physical tech]] brought about that were different until you had a lot of surplus there wasn't that much reason to raid in another culture because or another tribe [5425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5425.52s)

because they didn't have much store of value that you could extract um but also the the division of labor roughly around gender that is not absolute but is a statistically generally accepted thing that men would do the hunting women would do more of the gathering than women would do men would do more of the hunting women would do the horticulture with the digging stick as soon as it went from the horticulture and the digging stick to the agriculture and the plow men's upper body strength on the plow actually made a huge difference over women doing the plow when women would use the plow they [5458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5458.0s)

would miscarry and so men moved to um to providing almost all the caloric surplus women moved into the home and you started to see changes in gender relationships associated with the change in tech and the way that the tech itself the the idea is that the tech is not totally values neutral the tech ends up predisposing patterns [5478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5478.56s)

of human behavior in certain ways and so then some people argue that the rise of feminism largely followed the internal combustion engine the kind of women's liberation movement because then for the first time men's upper body strength didn't matter because she could drive a tractor as well as he could drive a tractor [5497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5497.12s)

and the tractor could out pull the plow oxen situation so much that the first wave feminism women can do what men could do was mediated by a change in tech so we can see those are not complete arguments or a lot of other cultural factors and things going on but folks like marvin harris and cultural materialism worked on [5515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5515.679s)

seeing and mcluhan specifically who worked on marvin harris was looking at how tech in [[physical tech]] in general affects [[social tech]] mcluhan specifically how the information and communications tech ends up affecting society's minds values um we saw obviously that the [[printing press]] gave rise to the lutheran revolution the idea that everybody could have their own bible and didn't need to have they could study the scripture directly and didn't need a priest to to mediate it but also the idea of a newspaper and democracy the idea that everybody could read what was going on [5555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5555.28s)

and they could all learn to read have an educational system and then they could all come to the town hall and debate the thing that was a change in [[physical tech]] that changed that made a new [[social tech]] possible right could you have done democracy before there was the ability to get everybody the news no way right like that was not at scale [5572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5572.96s)

you could at a tribal kind of scale but at a larger scale if some if the people don't all have access to information how can they participate in choice making so then as we were mentioning with [[social media]] and the you know the conversation that you'd have with folks like tristan the change to decentralize rather than [5593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5593.44s)

kind of one-to-many broadcast that both the newspaper and then the news was now the mini to mini information proliferation where then there's a billion search results for anything so how do i decide which ones to look at well whatever comes up in the first three pages of google or on the top of my [5613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5613.28s)

youtube search or in my facebook feed is going to be what i look at the ais that can comb through all those things and show me a specific subset ends up determining what i'm going to pay attention to in the information landscape those technologies are actually businesses those businesses have an [5629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5629.84s)

agentic motive of their own to grow profitability they do that through ads they do that through maximizing our time on site which improves ad revenue and our time on site is optimized by certain types of content over others and it mostly ends up being that it's optimized for the content [5648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5648.08s)

that creates limbic hijacks for me emotional hijacks of some kind so if i stay in a real rational place i usually recognize i don't want to spend that much time on facebook so [[hypernormal stimuli]] things that are outraging things that appeal to my existing biases maximize time on site so existing biases on all sides get increased and in-group group identity gets increased not even because facebook wants to do that it's just the nature of the algorithm optimizing for time on site associated with business model and that thing so that's that's an example of [[physical tech]] now that is a democracy ruining thing because it's actually replacing people [5687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5687.36s)

reading news where at least you know two different people's news feed in a in a very red area in a very blue area in the u.s might have not a single thing in common and the reporting on each issue is very very slanted and then it's selecting for the ones that the people are going to pay [5704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5704.32s)

attention to and so can you run a democracy where there is no shared reality basis at all no now that's an example of [[physical tech]] changing [[social tech]] in a downward oriented direction in some critical ways that doesn't mean there aren't also upward oriented directions so then the question starts to become if we want to we can see how the changes in [[physical tech]] made possible and even forced changes in social process [[social tech]] historically and not just [[social tech]] but the nature of even how i identify and the nature of um you know minds [5739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5739.44s)

things like patriarchy and religions with male gods following the plow like these are very fundamental changes um music so then what we want to start saying is what are the necessary requisites of [[social tech]] adequate to hold [[exponential tech]] what would new types of [[social tech|social technologies]] need to be oh this is the thread that we lost earlier if the problems need new problem solving capacities which they do because we can't keep narrowly defined problems that are this radically interconnected with this scope of consequence then we need new institutions and social capacities to [5778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5778.4s)

solve them those new institutions and social capacities are either enforced by a few people who understand them or they have to arise from the people if they are to be emergent if they are to be commensurate with a new type of [[open society]] the people have to understand the [[problem space]] and what is needed for it and care about it and be willing to take a responsibility in mediating it that's a kind of cultural revolution or cultural renaissance or enlightenment that i would say is the necessary thing that has to happen right now to give rise to new social institutions and problem-solving capacities adequate to the problem-solving landscape we're in right now so [5814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5814.08s)

if we take the problems and say what would necessary solutions require what would it require well it would require the ability to have shared [[sensemaking]] it require the ability to take the various values and actually hold them together and look for propositions that could meet them all better it would take um coordinate processes that coordinate choice making well um then we can start to say well if we need [[social tech]] that does that and that also means that to develop humans that have the capacity to do that how could we apply the new [[physical tech]] we have to develop people and societies in that way [5854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5854.719s)

i i've reached the end of my a lot of time for this conversation but there's a lot more we could talk about and i'll have to have you on again at some point to get to those things but this has been a great conversation i i'd like to point my audience in the direction of your consilience project could you talk [5873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5873.199s)

about that briefly yeah thank you um i am one of the members of a new project called the consilience project that is working on these topics working on how do we articulate what is novel about the [[problem space]] today clearly enough and it's not narrowly defined problems and it's not [5898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5898.88s)

kind of gross generalizations that don't end up giving rise to adequate solutions but how do we identify how the problems are interconnected and what gives rise to them the kind of systemic incentives and coordination challenges and like that well enough that we can identify what would necessary criteria [5918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5918.56s)

of adequate solutions look like and so there starts to get to be a a whole culture that is able to think about the problems much better and recognize the need to uh operate towards them take responsibility towards a much better and start to prototype new civilizational systems new collective coordination capacities adequate to the fact that we have fully globalized [[supply chain|supply chains]] globalized tech existential tech etc um and that if we want those new capacities to emerge from the people it has to be people understanding the issues working to develop the capacities in themselves and working to develop the right kind of good faith relationships with others [5963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5963.84s)

that can prototype these capacities so consensus project is a place where there's a publishing set of things we're going to do in a kind of movement facilitating set of things we aim to do the publishing thing is there's papers that are basically explaining the fundamental aspects of social theory [5984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=5984.48s)

that we think are necessary to consider to develop new adequate [[social system|social systems]] and the [[problem space]] then there's the application of that social theory to situational assessments of what's going on in the current world where people can both understand the theory in an instantiated way and understand the problems with deeper [6003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=6003.199s)

insights that could give rise to more adequate thinking about solutions and then there's this kind of meta news thing we developed which is a kind of forensic method to be able to show where there is highly polarized belief about something covet viral origins or [[climate change]] or systemic racism or whatever it is how do we identify the different views and how do we identify how those views came to be both it involves mistakes and partiality and active kind of [[narrative warfare]] and distortion and then what would synthesizing what we can identify as both the values and the [[sensemaking]] across those look like so this is if we're going to be trying to do [[sensemaking]] we also have to show where the breakdowns and sense-making occur and help develop in people the capacity to uh notice [[narrative warfare]] information warfare both intentional and unintentional that messes up the [[epistemic commons]] well so that they can participate more effectively so those are the kind of publishing efforts and the movement building efforts are anyone that is seeking to improve journalism or improve [[public education]] or fix the [[social media]] algorithms or try to take what taiwan is doing in digital democracy and iterate on it or apply [[blockchain]] to government accounting or whatever it is that would be part of fundamentally new adequate [[social system|social systems]] how do we identify the ones that are doing really good work and signal boost [6099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=6099.92s)

them and rather than having it just look like a journalism project or an education project be part of a fundamentally new civilization design movement that is starting to occur so those are roughly the things we're interested in and paying attention to so so not the big stuff just doing some casual stuff [6120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=6120.08s)

at the consilliance project this stuff that i think like you i just don't know how not to think about and so you know we're thinking about similar issues because uh i think attention and conscience mandates it absolutely all right well it's been a pleasure daniel i'll have to have you back until next [6140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpoGL0yIFE&t=6140.88s)
