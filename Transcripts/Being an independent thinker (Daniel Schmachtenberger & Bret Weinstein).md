my story is i went to school and it didn't work i had something that most people would call a learning disability and it got in the way of school functioning for me and more often than not i got dumb tracked and basically that complete failure of school to reach me accidentally worked like some kind of unschooling i would say [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=23.439s)

and so um there are maybe many paths i don't know but i'd be curious four people who have traveled some road to the land of high quality independent thought what can they expect the experience to be like when they arrived there the experience of high quality independent thought yes if you imagine that well it would be lovely to think independently and to do so well and the world is going to be a paradise if you start doing that because of course that's a very desirable thing to do and people will appreciate it you're going to be surprised that's not necessarily what happens when you arrive there and certain experiences show up [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=69.76s)

all over the place and without telling you what my experiences might have been i'm curious as to what you might have encountered and whether or not those things will be similar ah yeah it's an interesting question i think you will experience [87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=87.36s)

most people will experience a higher degree of uncertainty than people that are part of any camp that has figured most things out and they can cognitively offload whoever the authorities or the general group consensus is um and certainty is certainly comfortable in a particular way and if you're really thinking well about what is my basis for what i believe what is the epistemic grounding what's the basis of my confidence margin and you really think about your confidence basis clearly uh as you try to find more information to deepen the topic the known unknowns expand faster like at least at a second order to what [133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=133.12s)

the uh known knowns do and so you keep being aware of more stuff that you don't know that you know is relevant and pertains to the situation so there's a complexification of thought there's an increase in uncertainty hopefully there's an emotional development and kind of a psychological development [151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=151.76s)

where there's an increased comfort with uncertainty so that you can actually be honest and not uh defect on your own [[sensemaking]] into premature certainty that creates [[confirmation bias]] and there's also a and i think that's why you one of the reasons you use the term independent um [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=169.2s)

there is a certain aloneness of not having a whole camp of people that think very similarly um i don't find that to be a painful thing right but it's a thing no it's actually in its own way uh it's freeing because [191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=191.599s)

the fact is if you follow logic to natural conclusions you'll end up saying a lot of things that are alarming or discordant with the conventional wisdom and the world neatly divides into people who will be so enraged or thrown by what you're saying that they uh disappear or maybe they become antagonists at a distance and the people who have a similar experience and therefore aren't thrown by the fact that you're saying things that are out of phase and so editing the world down to those who are comfortable with what they don't know who are interested in following things [237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=237.76s)

where they lead irrespective of who that uh elevates and and who it uh um hobbles those people are interesting people to hang out with and so yes the uh the alienation may be a blessing in disguise in some ways there's two other thoughts that came up as you're just talking one is i i wouldn't call myself an independent thinker i'm being particular about the semantic of the word independent i wouldn't call anyone an independent thinker because i think in words invented by other people i think in concepts invented and discovered by other people um i don't necessarily have a specific [277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=277.6s)

school of orthodoxy from which i take an entire world view but almost every idea that i believe in i did not discover and so uh i think that's a very important concept because i think the the ideas we're going to discuss today regarding democracy and [[open society]] have to do with the relationship between an individual and a [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=302.96s)

collective and i think the i there the idea of an individual is fundamentally a misnomer without everybody else i wouldn't be who i am and i wouldn't think the way i think i wouldn't think in the language i do i wouldn't have access to you know the knowledge that came from the hubble telescope and the large [321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=321.759s)

hadron collider and so many things like that um so i can say that there is a certain like ultimate authority that of what i choose to feel that i believe in and trust that has an internal locus of control but the information coming from without in my own internal processing of it are [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=341.6s)

part of the same system so this is a perfect example of what i was suggesting up front where two people who do whatever we're going to call this will will have their own separate glossaries so if i can translate what you've just said i daniel schmucktenberger am not an independent thinker because such a thing is inconceivable in human [365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=365.44s)

form right and i totally agree with that the fact is not only are you interwoven with all sorts of humans who are responsible for conveying to you in one way or another conclusions that you couldn't possibly check you know these are thoughts that would be familiar [383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=383.84s)

to descartes for example but you are also building from the entirety of cumulative human culture right all of the tools with which you can think are uh almost all of them are too ancient to even know where their rudiments originated so anyway i don't disagree with any of that [405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=405.6s)

so to me i would say there is such a thing as an independent thinker and in your schema it has to do with whether or not they are thinking a la carte that is to say using that set of tools that is most effective irrespective of the fact that those tools don't all come from one tradition and you would say there is no [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=426.08s)

independent thought because a la carte is the most you can do or something like that i might say that i like a term like interdependent better because it doesn't mean that there isn't an individual involved but it means that the individual without everyone else is also not a thing and so the recognition that [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=443.039s)

sovereignty and individuality is a thing and it is conditioned by affected by and affecting other groups of people are both necessary in the hegelian synthesis to understand what is the nature of a human are they fundamentally individual and then groups emerge are they fundamentally tribal and they're formed by the tribe and it's very much both in a kind of recursive process [467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=467.52s)

between them 100 in fact i once wrote something i called the declaration of interdependence it was a sort of proto [[game b]] attempt to define uh what the rules of a functional society would be like and i also frequently say that the individual is more [489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=489.039s)

an illusion than it is real and what i describe is that an individual is a level of understanding that evolution has focused us on because historically it has been sort of the limit of that where we might have some useful control right evolution might ultimately care about whether or not you are [515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=515.039s)

successful your genes are still around 100 generations from now but your focus on 100 generations from now is unlikely to have any useful impact whatsoever whereas your focus on your life and your children is likely to be useful so we have we have been delivered a kind of temporal myopia in order to keep us [538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=538.24s)

focused on that which could be productive for an ancestor but of course we are now living in an era in which we can have dramatic impacts on the distant future in fact you and i are both quite focused on the strong possibility that our foolishness in the present will result [556](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=556.48s)

in the end of our lineage and that that is something that evolution were it capable of um upgrading would certainly have us concerned about because the hazard is very real and our tendency not to think about it is a big part of the danger i think [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=575.12s)

temporal myopia and the [[collective action]] collective coordination problem is a good way to describe all of the problems we face or one of the [[generator function|generator functions]] of all the problems we face that you have a bunch of [[game theory|game theoretic]] situations where each agent within their own agency pursuing [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=595.44s)

the choice that makes most rational sense to them pursues local optimums where the collective body of that drives local global minimums but if anyone tries to orient towards the longer term global maximum they just lose in the short term that's an [[arms race]] that's a tragedy of the commons and so [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=611.76s)

how do we reorient the [[game theory]] outside of those [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] i would say is one of our underlying questions that when the biggest harm we could cause was mediated by stone tools or bronze tools or iron tools or even industrial tools we didn't have to cause it immediately because the extent of harm was limited in scope [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=634.079s)

when it is mediated by fully globalized [[exponential tech]] running up against [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] with many different kinds of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] held by many different agents we actually have to solve the problem yeah i i of course agree completely with this as well that effectively maybe it really is every single [654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=654.72s)

important problem is a [[collective action]] problem of one kind or another we've got races to the bottom we've got tragedies of the commons we've got these things uh intermingled but once you start to see that on the one hand it is you could take from it a kind of [674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=674.399s)

reason for despair because these are not easy problems to solve on the other hand the discovery that effectively it's not a thousand distinct problems it's a thousand variations on one theme and that that theme is solvable in fact we have for example uh eleanor ostrom's work which points to the fact [694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=694.48s)

that evolution itself has solved these problems many times that that is hopeful so i don't know where you are in terms of how hopeful you find yourself about humanity's future but i'm quite certain that you and i will a line on the idea that yes if we could [715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ocPsqBKS4&t=715.04s)

focus on the problem as it was it's more tractable than many people think it is you
