do you have ideas of how we practically build systems that create a resilient society could we actually condition more social virtue more civic virtue more orientation towards dialectical synthesis more empathy more rationality widely yes would that lead to better capacity for something like [[participatory governance]] democracy or republic or some kind of [[participatory governance]] yes is it necessary for it actually yes let's not take gdp or gdp per capita as the metric we want to optimize for because gdp goes up during war and it goes up with more health care spending from sicker people and various things that we wouldn't say correlate to quality of life what would the metrics [46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=46.16s)

for a good civilization be if i had to pick a set of metrics what would the best ones be if i was going to optimize for those and then really try to run the [[thought experiment]] more deeply and say okay so what happens if we optimize for that try to think through the first and second and third order effects of what [66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=66.24s)

happens it's positive and then also say what negative things can happen from optimizing that when we start saying can we make tech where we're measuring for the things that it produces beyond just the measure of gdp or whatever particular measures look like the revenue generation or profit generation of my [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=86.64s)

business are all the meaningful things measurable and what are the right measures and what are the externalities of optimizing for that measurement set what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement set that might have their own externalities these are some of the questions we actually have to take seriously yeah and we i think [108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=108.32s)

they're answerable questions right progressively better not perfect progressively better not perfect progressively better not perfect i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are because i thought about this a lot i i don't think there is a metric a right one um progressively better not perfect i think that every metric by itself without this thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a [[paperclip maximizer]] i think that's why what the idea of false idle means in terms of the model of reality not being reality then my sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever to the known but [146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=146.879s)

also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know but to learn new stuff and to be open to perceive reality directly so my model never becomes sacred my model is useful so the model can't be the false idle correct yeah [166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=166.319s)

and this is why the first verse of the tao te ching is the dao that is nameable is not the eternal dao the naming then can become the source of the ten thousand things that if you get too carried away with it can actually obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the models one metric that i like to just as a [[thought experiment]] to consider is healthy human bonding say we were in a tribal type setting my positive emotional states in your positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated your negative emotional states in mind and so you start laughing i start laughing you start crying my eyes might [202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=202.72s)

tear up and music we would call that the compassion compersion axis so compassion is when you're feeling something negative i feel some pain i feel some empathy something in relationship compersion is when you do well i'm stoked for you the fact that it's such a [218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=218.239s)

uncommon word in english is actually a problem culturally because i feel that often and i think that's a really good feeling to feel and maximize for actually that's actually the metric i'm going to say oh wow is the compassion compersion access is the thing i would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional states in your emotional [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=238.319s)

states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy i don't want to hurt you but i don't care if i do or for you to do well or whatever but there's a worse state and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions correspond to your negative ones and vice versa [256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=256.56s)

and that is the i would call it the jealousy sadism axis the jealousy axis is when you're doing really well i feel something bad i feel taken away from less than upset envious whatever and that's so common music but i think of it as kind of a low-grade [278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=278.32s)

psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that i'm actually upset at the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly up thing no we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse we should study it where does it come from and it comes from our own insecurities and stuff [295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=295.52s)

and but then the next part that everybody knows is really up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is so the jealousy or the envy is the i feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is i actually feel good when you lose or when you're in pain i feel some happiness that's associated you can see [314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=314.639s)

when someone feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that partner to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion access so i would like to see a society that is inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the the [338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=338.0s)

lower that amount and the more the compassion conversion and if i had to summarize that very simply i'd say it would optimize for conversion which is because notice that's not just saying love for you where i might be self-sacrificing and miserable and i love people but i kill myself or happiness where i might be sociopathically happy where i'm causing [361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=361.68s)

problems all over the place music i mean i know you ask your guests about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're designing when you're saying what is a desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and to say what is a good civilization [388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=388.88s)

because it's going to be in relationship to that a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a better world what is the kind of world we're trying to create really i think well have you really thought i'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me but let me do the societal indices first [406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=406.56s)

because they're fun one index that i find very interesting is the inverse correlation of addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction within the people in it the less healthy i think the society is as a pretty fundamental metric and so the more the individuals feel [428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=428.0s)

that there are less compulsive things in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values uh and in so far as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it the inverse of addiction uh widely defined addiction [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=447.68s)

compulsive behavior that is destructive towards things that we value yeah i think that's a very interesting one to think that's a really interesting one yeah and this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed to [[hypernormal stimuli]] and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and needing that [[hypernormal stimuli]] which does involve a kind of hormesis this concept of hormesis that it's actually stressing an adaptive system that increases its adaptive capacity and that there's [489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=489.84s)

something that the happiness of a system has something to do with its adaptive capacity it's overall resilience health well-being which requires a decent bit of discomfort and yet in the in the presence of the comfort solution it's very hard to not choose it and then [506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=506.72s)

as you're choosing it regularly to actually down regulate your overall adaptive capacity i do think the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um virtualized discomfort yeah virtualized discomfort yeah virtualize discomfort yeah virtualized discomfort yeah to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome some things to make beings that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some fears but we don't want to put everybody in war or real trauma so how do we get the benefits of [550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=550.16s)

the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people a certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=569.279s)

because the other people are there so it's both a resilience of the individuals and the resilience of the bonding so i think we'll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also develop resilience in the presence of that for the anti-addiction direction and the fullness of character [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=587.6s)

and the trustworthiness to others and this is when i said the model of reality isn't reality when you make a set of metrics they were going to optimize for this whatever reality is that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs which is why i would say that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices beyond what metrics based optimization would offer yeah but another way to say that is wisdom is a constantly expanding and evolving set of metrics there is something in you that is [632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=632.32s)

recognizing a new metric that's important that isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection discernment awareness now i do not think this should be imposed by states i think it should emerge from cultures from the people by the people poor to people and i think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but there's also a voluntarism because the people value the thing that is being developed they understand it and that's what conditions is conditioning it's conditioning some of these some of these values in conditioning is [670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=670.72s)

a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize the language that we speak and the words that we think and in the in the patterns of thought built into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just based on where we're born you can't not condition people so all you can do is take more responsibility for what the conditioning [690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=690.56s)

factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is a meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and then we're becoming affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments digital [707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=707.279s)

environments physical environments social environments would we want to create that would develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even those sets of things that matter so you end up getting deep existential consideration at the heart of civilization design when you start to realize how powerful we're [727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPbOyjtv5PU&t=727.519s)

becoming and how much what we're building it in service towards matters virtualized discomfort yeah daddy
