welcome to the futurists with ben rhodey and alex lightman today our special guest is daniel schmucktenberger who is the director of research for the neurohacker collective i love the name neurohacker collective the idea is as far as we'll hear today to bring together some of the best uh science and insights [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=23.199s)

into how to make humans smarter and how to do a variety of things so let me uh first introduce my co-host ben rody say hello ben hey daniel thank you so much for joining us it's a delight to be here thanks for having me and i want to say too that this is a special show because it's our first show that [44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=44.0s)

we're doing while ben is in a hurricane costa rica and i'm in santa monica and then um neither rain nor snow not that he'd have that much snow but he does live on a mountain uh neither rain nor snow nor dark of night will keep ben rhody from doing the futurist show [65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=65.6s)

it must be it must be something i picked up as a mailman and um i think that i think it's it's interesting that we spent the last 30 minutes trying to get the technology here so i think like the running joke right now is how many futurists does it take to get to be able to record a damn show um yes and let's say that so we're also we're [83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=83.92s)

pre-recording this show it's it's uh 7 45 p.m for me because uh daniel is a vampire has a vampire schedule so i'm excited to hear about that at some point um and i'm i'm i read in your bio that about your vampire schedule and says so as long as you're able to meet daniel halfway um [104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=104.079s)

we'll get a lot out of it so here we are meeting uh meeting the vampire at night and i'm excited to buy it into this topic so first question um we we know about what's uh daniel what is biohacking and then within biohacking what is neurohacking so biohacking [130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=130.8s)

and neural hacking are both uh kind of amorphous and emerging terms biohacking has been you know very popularized with bulletproof and dave asprey and tim ferriss and people like that helping its emergence and you know very much relates to performance enhancements through any methodology it relates to kind of integrative medicine and wellness but from a slightly different perspective of rather than working on the disease model side of it what can we do on the fundamental wellness support and enhancement side of it which has some crossover with uh prevention on the disease side [174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=174.239s)

and there's some kind of idea with regard to hacking that it is a other than an establishment approach to uh how to do this so this is not biohacking is not emerging out of pharma and fda sanctioned kind of science it's emerging out of citizen science out of uh piecing together science from different places [194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=194.72s)

for kind of grander hypotheses out of the fields of uh elite sports and performance enhancement and all like that and neural hacking correspondingly is you could think of it as a subset of biohacking or you could think of it in kind of a venn diagram the way we think about neural hacking is really being able to hack the mind brain [215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=215.04s)

interface to be able to optimize people's cognitive and psychological well-being and capabilities so how do we enhance human experience and enhance human capacity cognitively psychologically through both physiological and psychological techniques and processes daniel what would uh what do you think [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=236.0s)

of the biggest six testes to date of biohacking or neural hacking oh i like this question well it's a good question uh i think since these are kind of newer spaces in the way that they are emerging some of their success is that they are actually emerging spaces where people [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=260.639s)

are uh finding solutions to kind of elite performance that didn't exist in the medical world that some of the knowledge that had been in very niche worlds is becoming more popularly available and that in kind of the overlap with the integrative medicine world people are finding solutions to better health that they had not found [280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=280.639s)

elsewhere and i would say in better health and well-being i would say that there are some good successes across a number of different verticals whether we're talking about athletics and weight and fitness or sleep optimization or uh you know cognitive optimization i i think there's actually a number of meaningful things that have happened in [299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=299.84s)

all those spaces well i'd like to tell our audience one stat in case you're thinking oh this is kind of cute it's nice it's just having fun this folks this is deadly serious you know when the last time i bet daniel knows this the last time that the fda approved a drug for alzheimer's do you know when that was [319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=319.44s)

i'm gonna say no for everybody okay it was 2003. it was 13 years ago so here we have the group of people with alzheimer's it's one of the fastest growing populations in the world and it's it's exploding and we have not been we haven't approved a drug now this show uh takes place post donald trump being elected [345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=345.039s)

president united states and i think one of his most interesting proposals is that he says there are 4 000 drugs awaiting approval at the fda and he wants to accelerate that so what i see is that there's a tremendous pent-up demand for a better faster cheaper [362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=362.639s)

more effective less less industrial uh less orthodox way of approaching health and achievement of human potential so daniel what uh what do you think that we're doing wrong and what do we need to be doing better as a society and what role do the does neuro hack king and the neurohoc neurohakka collective play in this [386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=386.0s)

that's a lot of big questions um i want to just kind of speak to the drug discovery and approval process and the regulatory processes for a moment i think we do need to take a major step forward in how we do medicine and how we do wellness but it is getting to take an [406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=406.639s)

evolutionary step that is standing on the shoulders of previous successes rather than um things that didn't make any sense when you think about the history of the fda we have the fda really gaining you know a lot of necessary traction after thalidomide when a drug that did work for morning sickness and pregnancy got moved forward [425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=425.28s)

too quickly and caused meaningful birth defects so there's this question of if you have delayed causation and very meaningful side effects how much of a longitudinal study do you need to do how big of a group needs studied on to know if there are rare but very serious effects so these [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=443.52s)

are not trivial issues um and so there is a purpose for appropriate methodology that we very much respect uh and i would say the current system has a number of limitations when we're looking at for instance animal trials there's a number of places where the data we're getting from animal trials really doesn't cross over into [465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=465.599s)

human biology well enough and it is a it's both scientifically and ethically not the best of how we can do it moving forward as we start to get into personalized medicine and wanting to be able to address an individual person's health uniquely differently based on their genome based on their whole history of [484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=484.72s)

life and exposure their microbiome than we would someone else clinical trials aren't an adequate way to know how to do that because we're not going to be looking at one drug intervention we're going to be looking at some weighted combination of a number of different things that might have never been used in exactly that ratio for [501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=501.199s)

exactly this person before so getting into n equals one optimization is a totally different kind of science and being able to do more decentralized science synthesize what we know across so many spaces and include citizen science and i think these are all parts of [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=518.0s)

some of the next steps of of scientific evolution that have to happen great so if this is the future of medicine what does this look like i think the biggest thing that i would speak to regarding the future of medicine because there's going to be evolutions in diagnostic technologies evolutions and therapeutic technologies [540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=540.56s)

both on the surgical acute medicine and on the chronic uh you know health side as well as evolutions in um neural hacking biohacking for elite optimization and for radical life extension there's going to be technological solutions in all those areas the thing that i think is most [562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=562.0s)

significant is how it all fits together which is a fundamentally upgraded model for understanding what health and wellness and biological resilience is and understanding what illness is how illness happens in in a more complex and complete way that uh doesn't have autoimmune diseases and neurodigen [586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=586.32s)

and so many cancers um underexplained but actually can have detailed and personalized explanations for these things that lead to cause level solutions and so if we want to dive in a little bit deeper i can talk about what i think and what we're working on as an emerging adequate model for understanding health optimization and disease prevention reversal i would love that i just want to make a quick comment because some people in our audience will not have heard the uh the phrase our term citizen science so citizen science is this emerging area that actually returns us to some of the golden ages of [626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=626.399s)

of science when people were at home experimenting in their own laboratories you know the does the discovery of oxygen happen in a home laboratory et cetera um i chaired a conference on citizen science the rise of the citizen science scientist in 2010 at harvard that was the first international conference on the topic [646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=646.24s)

and one of my favorite examples is people discovering stars and galaxies galaxy zoo you know sort of an [[open source]] way of of classifying things and also uh folding at home going and using people's spare computing power to do um basically go and doing protein uh experiments and analysis that would take [668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=668.88s)

uh large numbers of people and cost tens of millions of dollars to do but volunteers can do it and uh also a woman went to burger king once who was a chemist and they were giving away all these free colored glasses and she took one at home crushed it and then she found that it was toxic and [687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=687.12s)

so with all the scientists and all the regulatory agencies one person who didn't who wasn't the right person in the right place at the right time saved millions of people from being exposed to toxins uh and i would just give um one more example of why citizen scientist uh citizen science is vital right now [705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=705.92s)

there's a big debate about uh trump's uh appointment of myron ebel i think to be the new head of the environmental protection agency transition and people are saying oh my god it's gonna we're gonna reduce protections the fact is that the epa only tracks 13 chemicals and fracking has been used for 150 000 wells or more and it has 500 [731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=731.76s)

chemicals so i don't see the federal government i think this is a great metric we can look at the federal government with all of its power and money and 4 trillion a year is only tracking 13 chemicals out of 500 but many of those others ones are toxic so citizen science is one of the most [752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=752.32s)

important movements to protect our health and to come up with new innovations that we can that we that we have so um i appreciate you bringing that up and um now we can go back to the to what neurohacker collective is doing and i i can't wait to hear when in the health and medicine and human biology space in particular [772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=772.88s)

the rise of quantified self so all the different kind of tracking devices and you know wearables where we can track heart rate variability or gsr or so many things and the rise of uh apps software for tracking cognitive metrics psychometrics people's ability to test their own well-being and even hardware [794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=794.32s)

for people to you know test glucose more regularly or ketones or anything at home and there's a huge trend in these kinds of decentralized medical technologies and wellness technologies emerging this doesn't give us traditional placebo-controlled clinical randomized research but it does give us meaningful data over very huge data sets [816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=816.32s)

that we can do statistical analysis on as that data starts to be shared in meaningful and structured ways so i think one of the reasons that we have this rise of citizen science is that we have so much more access to actually scientific tools decentralized scientific tools and then access to information [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=836.88s)

processing that we didn't have previously in the form of like you're mentioning advanced computational capabilities to do protein folding and you know one of the things for instance that our company is working on right now is an app that can synthesize biometrics and psychometrics from many [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=854.88s)

different sources into one platform and then not only look at those biometrics with regard to you know where the numbers at on a reference range but where all the numbers are at in relationship to each other factoring all the complex causation that's known about wow i'm just i'm listening to so when i [873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=873.76s)

listen to your talk i i notice the way that your brain works that that like i'm imagining being inside of your brain and and the way that you speak is so like yes it's so technical and it's so academic and i remember i'm thinking about reading your your bio [895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=895.279s)

and uh one of your bios that i really liked was um you said i didn't have to unlearn all the stuff that basically everybody's taught through the current education system and that you were raised on buckminster fuller and and uh just all these amazing great minds and so i'm i'm just i'm i'm i'm [917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=917.839s)

i'm appreciating that in you and and and so um i don't want to change the subject if alex has another question about about this and i do want to get into this because i ordered some of your i got on the monthly plan because um my friend daniel raphael highly recommended it and he said it changed his life forever [939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=939.12s)

and so so i'm looking forward to getting my my first shipment so i have i have i have more questions about that but um i would like to hear about your just the way that you see the world like like how do you see the future and how do you create the future that maybe most people most people's brains don't work like [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=962.079s)

this we could have a conversation sometime on the future of education i i did have this unique fortunate uh childhood where my parents were educational theorists and they wanted to run an educational experiment and this was before the term unschooling uh which has kind of evolved since then [983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=983.44s)

which was raising us without any curriculum at all but exposing us to everything that they could expose us to in terms of different topics this is what we're doing with our kids awesome and then yeah they were just seeing where there were areas of interest and seeing how to facilitate them so [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1000.079s)

i didn't you know i didn't learn whole areas of uh spelling grammar american history that one would normally learn have illegible handwriting but i did get to dive much more deeply into the sciences and into activism and into many world philosophies uh then one would otherwise have the opportunity [1021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1021.759s)

to do and because i didn't have subject divisions i didn't think of the world in compartmentalized ways there was a conversation would move between neuroscience and then looking at what's actually happening at an atomic level understanding so astrophysics to [[complexity science]] for how to put it together for deeper underlying you know philosophy around reductionism and mind brain interaction that was just one conversation called how do we go about adequately understanding the nature of reality so when what that means in terms of uh overarching perspective is whether we're talking about social issues or [1056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1056.88s)

environmental issues or human biology issues one of the core things that i think that we are not doing adequately currently is understanding all of the various areas of uh interconnectedness and layers of cause and effect so when we're dealing with [[climate change]] and we're talking about carbon taxes or whatever kind of [1080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1080.0s)

approaches for [[climate change]] that don't get to fundamentally what all really has to happen to address not emitting greenhouse gases and sequestering them adequately and so you look at why is sequestration decreased of what are all the ways that we cause deforestation damage to uh you know any kind of photosynthesis on land on in water [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans you think about all the different kinds of agricultural fluents industrial fluids that are involved the economic drivers of it the underlying economic drivers underneath the you know energy economy an adequate solution involves a lot of things and so we [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1117.44s)

mostly do kind of a symptomatic approach that doesn't deal with the whole causal taxonomy and that's the same in medicine and so this is actually very interesting when we talk about why the systems have to evolve is when we have a for-profit medical system where ultimately patients are customers and the you know maximizing the lifetime [1139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1139.76s)

value of patients means maximizing lifetime value of customers which is something that when you're doing the numbers of running a business is an automatic kind of calculation if we can figure out how to address symptoms there's obviously more duration in that profit stream than preventing things [1158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1158.24s)

from happening at all or quick cures are so it's like where did the r d budgets even go there's where there is fiscal incentive for the wrong things where you have some of the most powerful organizations in the world have their own ongoing existence and the health well-being of everyone not [1177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1177.36s)

aligned and you know from an economic perspective it's not their fault as organizations it's a structural issue where you can say theory of markets really shouldn't apply yeah well they have shareholders to to please and all this so so now you're you're you're mentioning ways that people at home [1195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1195.76s)

will be able to monitor their own blood sugar and their their own health and and like devices that will uh tell you what's in your food so what's the you know i've seen a lot of different devices that do a lot of different things but what's the most comprehensive device that if i had one device that [1217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1217.28s)

would do everything is this has this been invented is it being invented i think i saw a kickstarter campaign of a device that looked like it was going to do this like read your palm like took a reading from some skin on your palm or something and like this is one of the really big x prizes right now is for the tricorder [1236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1236.88s)

devices and the tricorder uh medical devices are both for being able to do you know medical diagnostics in rural places where you don't otherwise have access to formal medical diagnostics but it's also for at home diagnosis and assessment the the one that i think is probably most [1258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1258.48s)

promising so far is the gene radar technology it's at least one of the best ones that anita goal and group from nanobiosim have developed which has the ability to look at pathogens specifically with better accuracy than pcr analysis but without needing to draw blood just on the drop of blood and that and then they'll be able to [1279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1279.52s)

move beyond pathogens most likely the key is moving from needing chemical reagents to study the blood to actually being able to study the blood on a chip so you can study many more things accurately with much less blood and much less turnaround time and processing involved i think there are metabolomic solutions for sweat for urine etc that can move [1301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1301.52s)

from chemical reagents to uh processing on ships that are emerging that are going to be really transformational and one of the areas that i personally have a lot of belief in that's in the very early stages is laser interferometry for being able to actually just bind beams of light into [1322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1322.559s)

the you know through the skin into the blood and then based on the chemistry of the blood you get different diffraction patterns you can read the diffraction patterns and as we learn the diffraction patterns of more molecules we could theoretically get the ability to assess almost everything that's happening in the blood in real time and you can start to imagine what it [1340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1340.72s)

means to have continuous data on an individual person processing in real time on the cloud where we can really separate and across a huge number of biometrics where we can really separate correlation and causation because we can see which things change first and so we can get big data on a single person and then also across many people [1360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1360.96s)

and start to get very early predictive analysis for things and start moving towards really customized personalized medicine wow it may sound like it's like it's instrumental overkill but daniel makes a very good point um i asked this question i have a bunch of questions that i like to ask people that nobody ever gets right and one of them i [1380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1380.64s)

i ask is how many chemical reactions are happening in your body you know you can pick whatever period of time but if i say per second nobody ever gets it like some people say 10 some people say 100 but the real answer is there are basically there are a trillion a tr a trillion chemical a trillion chemical reactions per second yeah it's we you know we don't know how to estimate this appropriately and every time we think we do we have another discovery not that long after where it goes up by some orders of magnitude but a trillion metabolic functions per second per cell is a current reasonable estimate and [1425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1425.44s)

then when you start thinking about you know time synchrony across those and then when you start thinking about sub chemical right information processing uh that might be happening it's it's a lot of information and that's one of the things that really we have to understand about human physiology is that it's a [1447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1447.6s)

self-organizing [[complex system]] and [[complex system|complex systems]] and complicated systems are very different complicated systems like a circuit board are not self-organizing they are designed from the outside they're not fundamentally adaptive and they don't have causal closure all over all of the input output feedback loops so self-organizing systems [1464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1464.96s)

are a very unique thing and understanding them actually requires a different kind of scientific approach where you can't remove the variables understand them in isolation put them back together and think you understand it well because the variables because of combinatorics they actually do different things in relationships than they do separately [1482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1482.96s)

and the synergy ends up being like like the cell respirates even though no molecules that make up the cell respirator on their own it's a synergistic [[emergent property]] of that order of complexity and so a reductionist approach will give you partial but fundamentally inadequate information so when we look at [1501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1501.36s)

neurodegeneration or any of the kind of complex diseases part of it is that we can't split the body up into uh neurology and oncology and gastroenterology and because gastroenterology we can see gut brain access stuff micro biome disorders that are causing neurologic issues the system is too interconnected to be separated that way there are bottom-up processes controlled by genetics and top-down processes can controlled by neuroendocrine process and connectomics that interact with each other to create these very dynamic nonlinear equilibriums we have to kind of understand how all those things work and how all the [1537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1537.2s)

different variables operate differently in relationship and so this is why [[complexity science]] is really necessary for understanding biosystems well and then when you start thinking about not just biosystems but biopsycho environmental systems where your body is affecting your psychology but your psychology [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1555.679s)

is affecting your body in turn through kind of psychoneuroimmunological interactions and your environment is affecting you and vice versa to really understand those needs at a different framework for understanding complex causation and that's actually what i think is at the core of the future of medicine is and it's [1573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1573.44s)

where we take incurable diseases where we don't actually understand the cause and it's because the cause is not the same thing every time the cause can be very different things for this so two different people's ms doesn't necessarily have the same cause we can find statistical correlations of specific [1590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1590.72s)

pathogens like borrelia burg de ferrai which has some correlation in light of matman's work or certain funguses that have correlation or certain neurotoxins either heavy metals or organophosphates or certain genetics or certain kind of nutritional deficiencies but the reason that none of them are one-for-one [1608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1608.08s)

correlations is because there's a number of different deviations from homeostasis that can lead to the kinds of pathophysiology and causal cascades that lead to those tissues and systems having those kinds of disorders and so we need a an adequate map of how multifactorial complex causal cascades work to then be [1632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1632.159s)

able to do differential diagnosis across them to find out exactly what weighted combination of which factors are involved for which people and then being able to customize both medicine and optimization for them okay so pay me a picture what does this look like like let's say there's somebody at their [1649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1649.52s)

house they want to figure out what's my health look like and or what caused my ms um and what can i do about it and so like what what does this machine do this this gene uh this gene machine like what does it do how do they use it and how does it like paint a picture for us that just [1671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1671.279s)

creates like that would create the value proposition that would make us say oh i get it that makes sense okay so um what i'm talking about right now is actually diagnostics [[complex system]] diagnostics and interpretation based on modeling and based on understanding more complexly causation and [1696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1696.0s)

where the causation is not obvious so causation with a gunshot is obvious right there are certain things where we have very clear causation then we know how to how to treat it but when we're dealing with very delayed causation where some some cause happens and the effect doesn't happen in the obvious way for a long time that's actually tricky or when there are multiple causes that actually all kind of have a confluence together into an emergent set of phenomena that's tricky or when something has a cause in one system and then it's affecting a different system or different set of tissues those require a different understanding of how cause and effect [1735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1735.039s)

works and so um i would say like this think about in order to give you the value prop i actually need to explain the model a little bit and then it'll make sense so think about what our bodies are as these complex adaptive systems these regulatory systems they're basically regulating [1756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1756.32s)

your temperature and your ph and the levels of so many different uh you know biomarkers and processes so it's a it's a homeostatic regulatory dynamic regulatory system where all the different regulatory axes are interacting with each other to make this adaptive system and then we can define illness and decreased health in terms of we can think about aging and decreased health as decreased resilience of the homeostatic system decrease regulatory capacity because either there is less range that can be regulated over or less uh ability to move disequilibrius movements out of homeostasis back into homeostasis [1805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1805.6s)

quicker and so one of the things we want to do is to support the underlying homeostatic not the homeostasis of the system the levels of where things are what your cholesterol levels are this is less interesting than supporting the homeostatic capacity of the system to self-regulate so many things in dynamic equilibrium with each other in relationship [1826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1826.799s)

to what's actually happening in the environment so we want to and this is you know this is how do we support things like cellular energy and you know the atp production process how do we support things like autophagy and all of the all of the aspects of just how homeostasis happens systemically and this is kind of we can [1846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1846.64s)

think about as prevention of illness and supporting life extension and then we can also think about illness as wherever there's some deviations from homeostasis that exceed the homeostatic capacity of the system to stay within physiologic ranges and then the result is pathophysiology [1866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1866.24s)

changed physiologic function uh that starts to create pathology and so when we think about it that way we'd say okay so before someone gets a particular autoimmune disease we can see that certain inflammatory markers elevate so we can say inflammation caused it but something caused the inflammation something caused the hormone imbalance whatever those are intermediary markers so they're part of a causal cascade but they're never going to be the tier one deviation from homeostasis because they're messenger molecules and so you have to say you know what was their initial stimulus and the initial tier one deviation from homeostasis for any [[complex system]] is always going to be some overarching behavior of the system or some interface of the system with its environment that's not aligned with what its regulatory system can process and so if we say in interaction with the environment we mean if it if the system if the body takes in too much of something that it can't process we call that [1927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1927.36s)

toxicity or pathogenicity or if it takes in not enough of something we call it deficiency these are tier one deviations or if the if the system doesn't [[exercise]] enough or doesn't sleep enough or uh you know bad posture those are overarching behaviors [1946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1946.72s)

of the system that are not aligned with again what its homeostatic systems evolve to be able to process and work with so we can actually formally identify all of the tier one causes and then we can sub taxonomize everything that happens all the toxins all the pathogens all the nutrient deficiencies all the genetic [1966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1966.159s)

disorders etc and then we can look at all the causal cascades and then this gives us the ability to say these are the things we're looking to do diagnostics we want to look at both what's happening at a causal cascade level inflammatory markers hormones etc and at an initial cause level pat [1985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=1985.44s)

uh you know pathogenicity toxicity deficiency etc can you still hear me yeah you're doing great and then um so this starts to give us a basis for both wellness optimization prevention and then when someone has a specific illness being able to identify specifically what's going on and how to reverse those deviations from homeostasis while non-specifically generally increasing system result resilience and robustness so what would that mean from a you know visualize a practical point of view it means if you actually think about how many different kinds of medical assessment [2034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2034.32s)

we have and just even if i'm even just talking about blood markers and not looking at electrophysiology or anything else between all of the rheumatologic assessment and toxicologic assessment and metabolomics and and you know all the comics right transcriptomics genetics etc there right now it's a tremendous amount of [2056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2056.159s)

blood from different labs that has to be drawn with a lot of cost and you know accuracy issues on many of them if you start thinking about what it would mean to be able to get all of that data and oftentimes you think well that data is not relevant for the kind of condition i have that's one of the things that we find that is not [2076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2076.56s)

the case is that the system is so much more interconnected that in sometimes why we're saying it's an idiopathic illness meaning we don't understand you know why it's happening is because we're not looking at the right types of causes non-obvious causes so we want to be able to look at all of the different things that could [2095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2095.2s)

be part of a causal cascade that lead to leads to what's going on and then be able to do data analysis across the whole thing so imagine in the future that we start getting the ability to do diagnostics much less expensively much more easily across many more biometrics more accurately and [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2112.96s)

then be able to interpret what those mean across this kind of complex causation model and then the machine you're talking about is actually an ai system not like a sentient ai but a combinatorial ai that can um process you know a tremendous amount of data against a [2132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2132.72s)

and a causal ontology that's ever evolving and actually you know be able to help doctors physicians you know whomever identify specifically what's going on in terms of the pathological cascades and in terms of the kinds of things that could be the upline causes of those pathological cascades and then be able to reference for every pathway that's involved what the best current therapeutic technologies are and then what the right order of operations and the right synergy of those technologies are to actually be able to address what's going on for someone well that sounds like the most complicated thing i've ever heard in my [2170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2170.96s)

life dr house at scale so i'm glad you're working on this instead of me so a really good diagnostician does is they do this they factor thinking through causation more complexly it's just it's beyond what any individual human can do and we want it to be widely available [2192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2192.16s)

and so that can be done through technology yeah that's great um do you consider yourself a human or do you consider yourself technology i think that's a false dichotomy you can be both okay so so talking about causation one of the things that that i've explored is the is illness happening in the body as [2219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2219.359s)

a sign right what's the you know like we've all the stories of somebody gets cancer and they've um you know and then they quit their job and go live their life purpose and and then forget about the cancer cancer goes into remission and you know it's kind of like it was a wake-up call right so and i know that a [2239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2239.599s)

part of your genius cross-contextualizing your genius uh is is you've got the scientific background and then you've also got the shamanic background and the philosophy and so so what are your thoughts on you know the difference between biomarkers and and chemicals and and the environment [2264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2264.88s)

creating an illness and the the the um you know the mind the the psycho somatic reasons that the the the the markers in our dreams that are here to wake us up or remind us to pay attention to to our body what what are your thoughts on all that let's talk about the environment and the [2290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2290.32s)

psyche because they're both very interesting things that are not well enough addressed how we think of medicine usually so on the environment side if we have agricultural processes where the deplete topsoil and deplete trace minerals and topsoil so no matter uh what people are eating and if they're [[eating well [2311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2311.839s)

]] they are getting decreased trace mineral uh density from an [[evolutionary environment]] factoring affecting the trace minerals in the soil factoring the microbiome in the soil factoring the uh hybridized seeds you know so many things do you think real quick just uh on on this topic are do gmos contribute [2333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2333.839s)

to uh loss of the nutrients and what do you what do you think about that just as a quick aside i wouldn't address it as a whole category i would say we could get into each one but yes that is a real potential and not but it's not just gmos even hybridizing [2356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2356.24s)

crops uh effects you know as we're breeding for more sugar or more you know fruiting we're also breeding for less of some things it might have been very relevant parts of you know our evolutionary relationship with those plants but as you look at having something like mineral and microbiome deficiency [2374](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2374.64s)

ubiquitously in mass or then you look at environmental toxicity everything from the environment of inside my house where my my paint and my flooring all have high voc output volatile organic compound output where most of those vocs are either carcinogens or neurotoxins or endocrine [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2394.0s)

disruptors and then you know you go outside and whether we're talking about from coal plants or from cars or from so many sources the you know ubiquitous kinds of environmental toxicity where we can run mother's breast milk run toxicology on the united states and find hundreds of distinct petrochemicals and mother's [2413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2413.839s)

breast milk and you think about what's happening to the babies that are evolving in that right and that's not just people who live in in the center of industrial zones that's everybody and so when you think about a world where the way we've done infrastructure has deficiency and toxicity and because of [2431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2431.68s)

things like mrsa and pesticide resistant and fungicide resistant bugs weird mutated pathogens in mass can you this becomes a deep question can you have optimized people in a highly damaged biosphere wow no right so the future of medicine has to be the future of everything too [2457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2457.68s)

oh that's good and so you know we'll we haven't even spoke to the psychology side yet which is individual but it's also systemic if you have a macro economy where people are fundamentally stressed out about money and surviving and you're asking what's the effect of psychology and stress on health it's significant right yeah [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2478.72s)

there's so many kinds of degenerative disease so as part of the future of health care a better macroeconomic system has to be if you have a macroeconomic system you know political systems that cause war war is not good for health and neither is in neither is industrial process that [2497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2497.52s)

causes environmental externality because there is no externality on a tiny biosphere floating through outer space where everything is interconnected with everything else and so ultimately the future of medicine what we're talking about the future of human wellness is that we are fundamentally interconnected with everything else happening on the biosphere and [2516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2516.64s)

any place where we are externalizing harm it's not really external we just aren't calculating the cause and effect of it so we can talk about the future of medicine from the point of view of working just on individuals even if they're within an environment that is actually a cause of pathology itself but we have to then go beyond [2535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2535.04s)

that and say how do we have the environment the mac you know individual homes and then also macro environments be a cause for regeneration rather than for ill health and it it really does involve nothing less than fundamental redesign of civilization from scratch [2553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2553.2s)

from a infrastructure level and a political socioeconomic level and that's exactly what we're doing at rise that's it yeah that's good that's good okay so i know we don't i know we're gonna say oh yeah yeah yeah go ahead do people's brains and bodies of and imbalances and hormones neurochemistry etc [2577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2577.44s)

affect their psyches absolutely do imbalances in people's psyches from the way they allocate meaning and what they focus on and their definition of success and identity uh does that affect their physiology absolutely uh can we reduce mind to brain it's very problematic to try and but it's the it's kind of a given within the way we think about science because science system is a philosophic system it's a method of knowing right it's an epistemology but it's based on measuring stuff so it can only understand measurable third-person stuff and consciousness is not independently measurable third-person stuff it's [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2618.96s)

first-person stuff yeah and so it's fundamentally outside the domain of science so all science can do is measure the neural correlates of consciousness what is someone's eeg doing when they describe they're experiencing something but that might be a neural correlate and there's a lot that we need to say about how to even infer properly but that that's not first person experience right and so we can have a deeper philosophic conversation around ultimately what is the nature of the real does this physicality emerge from consciousness does consciousness emerge [2651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2651.68s)

from complex neural networks do they co arise in some kind of structured pan psychism but what we what we can say without getting into all that right now is that people can do different things psychologically that affect their health and the placebo study is a classic example right placebo is thinking they're going [2674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2674.4s)

to get well and feeling correspondingly less worried and more hopeful and then getting some degree of improvement symptomologically or pathophysiologically and then you're like but if the body's trying to optimize health all the time why wouldn't it have done that anyways and it's because the chemicals that mediate feeling that's actually question but it's because if you feel shitty anxious angry whatever that that emotion is neurochemically and you know hormonally mediated and what just happens to be very interesting is that most of those emotions are sympathetically mediated which actually does not support [2716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2716.24s)

the regenerative processes of the body and when someone relaxes feels more hopeful and then feels better that can support parasympathetic [[nervous system]] engagement and physiologic regeneration and there's there's a lot of actual physiologic pathways that are involved in people's emotional and cognitive experience and so um this is why i would say psychology by itself is not adequate because someone can have physiologic disorders they're not going to psychotherapy away or meditate away and medicine by itself is not adequate because the complexity of the information processing that's happening inside of someone's consciousness is not reducible to gross neurochemicals great answer great answer do we lose alex alex hey there buddy we lost him um anyway you and i are still here and i'm in a costa rica hurricane he's on a landline in santa monica so my question to you so i i know we've got to go here in a few minutes um i want to hear i want to hear two [2791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2791.92s)

things i want to hear quickly about your your sleep habits um i i thought about and i tried a long time ago to do polyphasic sleep it sounds like that's not quite what you're doing you just have a is it just a backward sleep uh cycle yeah this is nothing particularly interesting uh there are [2816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2816.8s)

kind of sleep hacking techniques like polyphasic that some people do that i have done in the past but i have uh since the earliest i can remember in childhood been nocturnally oriented and while i have forced that schedule into a diurnal schedule for world purposes a number of times it always is more natural for me to be [2840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2840.8s)

on a nocturnal schedule and my my actual clarity of thinking and productivity and all like that is best during the quietest hours um and so i it seems that there some of it just might be preference but it also seems that there might be uh some groups of people who for whatever reasons have different circadian rhythms wow that's so cool i mean i i've thought [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2862.96s)

about this and especially when i was looking at a polyphasic sleep like there's nobody texting you calling you messaging you like my phone's blowing up the whole the whole day when i'm uh the whole during the day right and so at night you just get to focus and and work your magic without the distractions [2883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2883.76s)

this is why i love it i i've actually been here the whole time i we are using a new system and i couldn't find the unmute button uh so i finally found it daniel i had a question for you how can how can i get smarter um what's smarter is a word i would want to dive into a little bit [2910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2910.96s)

whether you mean increased short-term memory or long-term memory or speed of memory or focus or attention or more knowledge or all every way that i can get smarter by every measure i want to do that yeah um so this is this is the neurohacking space right and so there are uh chemical approaches uh [2933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2933.68s)

the whole field of notropics and brain nutrients and smart drugs are all about exactly this how to be able to hack biochemistry and neural chemistry for affecting cognition either as a whole or very specific cognitive processes there's also you know tdcs tms different forms of [2956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2956.24s)

you know transcranial stimulation that people will use transcranial lasers try and hyperclock atp in particular regions their brain um there are uh microbiome solutions to kind of increase the normal healthy neurotransmitter output that might be decreased in their gut so there's a lot of like i would say biochemical solutions there [2975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2975.119s)

are future solutions that are not available yet but in process that are things like you know crispr genomic solutions that actually change genetic predispositions towards brain function um there's obviously brain computer interface uh technologies in process um and [2994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=2994.72s)

this is all kinds of things on the physiologic side and then on the information processing kind of on the software side um there's a lot one can do there so i would say um the more one learns about any domain and consciously thinks about [3016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3016.96s)

the cross-applicability of that like why is this domain the way that it is thinking through everything else you know it does this commentary with the rest of my knowledge making an interconnected database where you don't have arbitrary subject delineations to apply what you know from thermodynamics to biologic systems and gain interesting [3034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3034.24s)

insights right from from different kinds of systems and then the larger just net database of knowledge you have and the more interconnect that knowledge set is the more kind of insights you will have for lateral application to any new topic that comes when you think about even if i don't know this [3052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3052.0s)

topic well i know a lot about universe surrounding that topic that can have cross applicability and then also frameworks for thinking so studying [[systems thinking]] and uh things like integral methodology and uh complexity and critical thinking where one actually has better abilities to vet [3075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3075.119s)

if things are true or not quickly to know all the perspectives necessary to assess a particular situation well and then how to synthesize those perspectives the you know actually studying epistemology studying the processes of thinking and knowing is very useful wow cool so now with your [3096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3096.88s)

thank you very much now i didn't say there the basics are make sure you sleep enough because you'll lose cognitive ability very quickly if you're not sleepy enough make sure that you eat well make sure that you [[exercise]] make sure that your water blood sugar is stable all of the basics of a healthy [3114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3114.64s)

physiology so that you actually have healthy brain and information processing um make sure that you you know [[meditation]] and the right kinds of psychotherapy in life that you can actually focus well uh and you have a brain that is not over anxious or over stressed out you know these these are all [3134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3134.079s)

different things so you know what we're actually working to do at neurohacker collective is kind of vet all of the different types of neurotechnology that can help cognitive optimization and on the physiologic side and on the learning and uh you know psychological side vet all of the processes techniques technologies and say which ones move what kinds of metrics for what kinds of people involving what kinds of pathways and then once betting those how do we synthesize all of those partial answers to be able to then make available the best of human knowledge with [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3175.359s)

progressively more personalization and customization to each person so you know to just make it kind of simple say someone was asking asking about how to become smarter is a very broad thing we could kind of dive into uh specific subsets but for for illustration purposes say someone [3194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3194.559s)

wants to address anxiety well how much of their anxiety is physiogenic and how much is psychogenic and then of the psychogenic stuff if someone was not anxious as a kid and then they had kind of acute adult trauma that led to ptsd or someone that was always anxious from kind of early childhood [3216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3216.319s)

attachment theoretic structures even though those are both psychogenics they they actually don't lend themselves equally well to the same kinds of psychotherapy and on the physiogenic side anxiety from a gut brain access disorder that needs microbiome processing or from mild head injury or from a genetic methylation disorder [3238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3238.079s)

or from excitotoxicity from neurotoxins like again those are all real uh causes of pathology and they need addressed differently so we can just say like i've got a hammer so everybody is a nail everyone should do breathing techniques so they should all do vipassana [3257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3257.68s)

or they should all take a benzodiazepine and we'll get some effect everybody on a bell curve if we want to put everybody on the front end of a customized bell curve we have to be able to assess what are all the things that could be involved and what they're looking for how do we assess what's actually going on for them and see where the greatest lift is going to occur okay so now so your product uh qualia is that how you say it yeah i'm so excited to uh get my first shipment um how does this how does this actually affect the brain and what like what what are some things that people notice when they first start [3298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3298.72s)

taking it like what is what are some things i have to look forward to um so quality is the first product that the neurohybrid collective as an organization has made available recently brought to the market we have uh many other products in the kind of biochemical nutraceutical space [3318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3318.16s)

that are in development not currently on on the market including uh more personalized versions of qualia um and then also things in other areas of neurotech but uh this was something that was able to address a specific need we were interested in which is when you see that there are something like 15 billion dollars a year in uh energy drink sales and something like estimated five billion dollars last year in off-label adderall sales for people using it as a smart drug so many other smart drugs like that and this kind of exponential rise of desire for increased [3360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3360.88s)

productivity in a world where people feel both more demand and more things competing for their attention and damaging their focus and you either have kind of some vitamin herbal solutions that don't really do anything obvious for people or you have things like some of these you know either [3382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3382.96s)

excessive amounts of stimulant or off-label pharmaceuticals that can do something but oftentimes it's a very partial result with pretty meaningful side effects we wanted to see can we actually increase elements of cognitive capacity neurochemically in [3402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3402.839s)

a way that had a much more broad set of cognitive benefits where we were not just increasing focus through a dopamine energy process but we were addressing attention span and concentration and speed of memory and verbal fluency and digit span and you know all of the different sub aspects of cognitive capability along with the [3424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3424.72s)

emotional traits that need to come along like uh emotional resilience and uh you know the kind of drive necessary to follow through and not procrastinate so we were looking at kind of cognitively modeling when people want to take when people are seeking cognitive enhancement what are they really seeking and they're seeking the ability to go into creative [3445](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3445.68s)

productive flow states where their full cognitive capacity is available uh more readily being able to go into those states so we modeled what are those states from a cognitive point of view and then we looked at what are all of the physiologic systems that mediate each of those functions that we know of and what can we do [3469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3469.04s)

to support and enhance the function of those underlying systems and so qualia was you know a number of years of refinement and development specifically intended to do that to support the underlying systems that mediate those kind of creative productive flow states and to do so in a [3489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3489.92s)

way that is not only causing some immediate effect but it's also in it's supporting the body's own regulatory processes rather than overwriting them so that rather than leading to dependency it's leading to increased system resilience even after someone stops using it [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3507.839s)

great cool it must feel really good to having been worked working on this for so long to have it complete and and people benefiting from it already i've heard a lot about it what are some of the other things that you're working on that that we can look forward to uh if you can talk about it the next [3528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3528.079s)

handful of things that are likely able to come out are going to be um more personalized versions of qualia where people are you know seeking a similar goal right they're seeking increased cognitive clarity and availability to create great work you know while having good states of [3550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3550.72s)

human experience but being able to address more different kinds of physiology types so we're working on customization which doing that at scale is tricky but we're uh we're getting close and we're also working on support for uh other goals like sleep and calmness and fun weirder things like [[meditation]] and lucid dreaming support oh yeah cool let's do that then i'll take i'll take one of those too thank you yeah i mean there there we have to separate what is interesting scientifically and what is doable from a regulatory process so [3592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3592.319s)

you know there's a tremendous body of data supporting psychedelic assisted psychotherapy is actually being uniquely capable of addressing certain kinds of issues more quickly than anything else and it's very silly that we still have the regulatory process around it we do it is not good law um but obviously we have to [3609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3609.2s)

work in what we can do both from a scientific and a regulatory point of view daniel i wish we could talk longer uh this is almost all the time we have i have one more question for you yeah we we end each show in a similar way we ask our guests to give our listeners three things that [3629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3629.839s)

they can do uh related to the show so in your case what are three ways that people can improve their intelligence their health or their ability to engage in citizen science perhaps perhaps one of each um okay so a good way to improve your [3648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3648.24s)

health and intelligence that this is not going to be novel but hopefully if we've developed any rapport over the conversation i can add to what one knows about it is uh sleep well and enough it's the more we study sleep the more profound its effects on cognition and physiology are [3672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3672.319s)

memory consolidation is almost exclusively happening during slow wave sleep delta sleep and if someone's not getting enough slow wave sleep not only are there physiologic effects and uh the body does so much of its antioxidant and anti-inflammation and et cetera worked in but memory consolidation is is very [3688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3688.799s)

limited um and that's how much is enough sleep how do we know this is genetically different for different people and then even for the same people if they have things going on with their physiology or how much they're working out or what their stress loads are it'll all be different uh for most people uh this is in the [3705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3705.52s)

eight hours of uninterrupted uh sleep that's ideal some people need less than that and if someone has something going on with their physiology or they're under a lot of strain working out very hard they might need more than that age is a factor um but a way that you can know is that you wake up feeling refreshed and have good energy throughout the day [3727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3727.2s)

and if you have to wake up to an alarm still tired and are tired throughout the day then there might be other things going on as well but we would like to see the people not waking up to an alarm tired um and then especially stimulants like caffeine are not universally bad for people there's actually good research showing [3746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3746.72s)

that many times in many cases they're healthy and longevity supporting but using stimulants in place of sleep is bad for you and this is what makes adrenal burnout um and so here's one thing i would say for intelligence and psychological well-being and health and everything is [3762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3762.72s)

re-prioritize sleep so that's one two there are so many you know things i could say here but um study how to how to learn i would say read a book on systems theory read some stuff on complexity read some things on epistemology read you know play with integral philosophy and see if i would say for every hour invested in learning how to learn then everything else that you're learning is working through better frameworks and it has a over time exponential positive so um i'll call that number two okay and also for integral philosophy do you recommend [3810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3810.88s)

ken wilbur as the guy the go-to guy that's the starting point and this is not that someone's necessarily going to be called to all of it or agree with all of it ken did a major synthesis work the quadrants came from uh jurgen habermas the hollows came from arthur kessler uh developmental psychology came from [3828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3828.319s)

you know kohlberg and graves and so many people so he he identified really good meta theories or meaningful at least insightful metatherapists and brought a number of them together to be able to look at things like um human development and so it is it's an insightful place to look at a number of meaningful meta [3849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3849.28s)

theories together um and a brief history of everything is a good lay introduction to it and then one can go further in different places and there will be some stuff that sounds kind of mystical pseudosciencey and that's okay i would again just [3865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3865.92s)

look at the underlying philosophic structures um and maybe number three now i will say if someone is learning how to learn but they're not actually learning content it won't work you also then have to be learning content like whatever fields you're passionate about study them more allocate more of your life to [3885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3885.359s)

studying them and then as you're studying them you actually get an example of applying those thinking models and so it's the combination of those that makes a huge difference and then number three i would say uh in you know just a straight kind of plug for what we're doing go check out the website yeah i mean [3905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3905.039s)

if qualia calls to uh then by all means check it out and either way there's a lot of information on neurohacker.com and every day more is getting up there about how cognition works and the chemistry that affects it and uh over the next little while we're planning on robusting that to be a very meaningful uh knowledge source for people so uh awesome check it out cool so if you're if you're able to so i'm pulling up a bunch of new tabs on my on my desktop as you're throwing out of these examples of things to study if you were to recommend one book like your all-time favorite book [3944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3944.24s)

that just blew you away um that was also consumable for uh the average person what would that be it's an impossible question uh pick a book any book it's like asking what my favorite nutrient is where you can die of nutrient deficiency across some meteor um i don't think it's that serious but the first book that popped to mind [3974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3974.88s)

is a critical path by buck mr fuller oh great okay cool all right i'm gonna get my kindle so thank you very much daniel schmuckenberger of the neurohacker collective this is our show uh and ben i admire your courage going ahead with the [3998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=3998.079s)

show even with a hurricane the very first landfall of a hurricane on costa rica since 1851 so this is a historic show and i i think it's very fun that we've done it i've really enjoyed this i learned a lot i hope people listening um uh we'll get something tremendous out of it uh [4020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FschjBcFElk&t=4020.079s)

thank you both good night thank you everybody have a good one
