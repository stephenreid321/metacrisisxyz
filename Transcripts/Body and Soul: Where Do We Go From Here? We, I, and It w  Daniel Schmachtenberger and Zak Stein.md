music the stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of what's happening now um we are wow this is a double header today and we started at uh 12 noon eastern time with a great session on the ecology of anarchology of [29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=29.519s)

communication with nora bateson and diane muschel hamilton and today and i'm going to ask them to write their correct name i don't know why that happened but uh our our guests today this afternoon uh is zach stein and daniel smochtenberger uh for some reason the default uh is my name but i did not do that [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=55.84s)

laughter so um i'm gonna hand it over to to greg double g and uh let him take it from here in terms of setting the stage amen well it's a real honor to be here uh i'm super psyched i get to touch with my good friend zach stein uh and get to have a uh hear from daniel [78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=78.4s)

schmochtenberger is one of my real leading forces and leading edges in society as far as i'm concerned right now that i follow so um i'm super excited for us to talk about the we the i the it think about what it is that we are doing as a collective reflect on our epistemics and our values [102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=102.399s)

and the direction of our education um and so uh i'd like to welcome daniel thank you so much for uh joining us i'm just enjoying the comment thread it's actually really great right now cool cool good way to start everybody here thanks for having me hey rayne absolutely today it's good to see you [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=128.0s)

cool cool and zach welcome to you also yeah thank you i'm uh i'm excited this is a hell of a jam we've got set up here absolutely man so what what i'd like to do is play a clip from daniel's recent conversation with brett weinstein a long conversation a three-hour conversation but there was a portion [158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=158.8s)

that just jumped out at me because it reflected on the very theme of our session and it's within two minutes but as daniel does there's a lot back in that two minutes so i want to play that and then and this is similar to what we did earlier daniel you frame the song but first we're going [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=179.84s)

to start with comments by zach double g gregoriquez and myself and then have you come in so you're going to hear us sing on your song and then you come in how does that feel i like it being facilitated by a jazz guy all right so let me screen share [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=203.04s)

and let everybody see what i'm talking about okay okay and the only answer out of the oppression or chaos is the comprehensive education of everyone in the capacity to understand at least three things they have to increase their first person second person and third person epistemics their third person epistemics is the easiest philosophy of science formal logic their ability to actually make sense of base reality through appropriate methodology and find appropriate confidence margin second person is my ability to make sense of your perspective can i steal [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=261.12s)

man where you're coming from can i inhabit your position well and if i'm not oriented to do that then i'm not going to find the synthesis of a dialectic i'm going to be arguing for one side of partiality harming something that will actually harm the thing i care about in the long run and then first person can i notice my [280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=280.16s)

own biases and my own susceptibilities and my own group identity issues and whatever well enough that those aren't the things that run me when i look at kind of the ancient greek enlightenment the first person was the stoic tradition the second person was the socratic tradition [299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=299.28s)

the third person was the aristotelian tradition there's a mirror of all those in modernity we need a new cultural enlightenment now that where everyone values good [[sensemaking]] about themselves about others about base reality and good quality dialogue with other people that are also [[sensemaking]] to emerge to a collective consciousness and [[collective intelligence]] that is more than our individual intelligence and with so that we have some basis of something that isn't chaos but that also isn't depression because it's emergent more than imposed so it's like it's cultural enlightenment or bust as far as i'm concerned all right so i don't [335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=335.68s)

okay is cultural enlightenment or bust lost so i would like zach to riff on that and then double g greg enriquez and then i'll say a little something something and then we'll go from there totally uh i mean this is the core of the you know almost the year-long work [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=367.12s)

daniel and i have been doing uh with the conciliants project and in many ways the root of our collaboration and the root of a lot of the work that i do as an educational philosopher i didn't put it in terms of cultural enlightenment i put it in terms of that were an educational crisis and so yeah it's a deep diagnostic point [388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=388.16s)

and reason for hope i think for the future um and so yeah there's a lot of things to say specifically i will say that a cultural enlightenment doesn't mean the modern enlightenment right so it's important not to mistake it for what greg calls men's which is the modern enlightenment natural science which [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=410.16s)

which would be one-third of what daniel spoke to right right that we need actually a different kind of more comprehensive cultural enlightenment um which you know there's historical precedent the when daniel speaks to the education of everyone right this is a one of the great dignities of [428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=428.88s)

modernity um and i attributed to uh johnny most communious who i've spoken about on the stove before and spoken with greg about and it is that notion of um the basis of new social reality beginning with culture specifically with the life of the ideas that live between [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=454.319s)

us and so yeah and the first person second person third person framing of course is resonate with my metapsychological model with development ensoment and transcendence and the notion that there's a kind of a for lack of a better shorthand and up leveling necessary across each of those three modalities [475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=475.84s)

which needs to be facilitated by kind of like techno-social education-centric reform at a very broad scale and so that's a big project but it begins with realizing that this is the project to do that it's fundamentally educational work that needs to be done first in the interest of something like [497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=497.52s)

uh an enlightenment um and if you look around these are the times in which enlightenments arise liminality times of chaos uh when convention both breaks down and is raiified and locked in right so these are the age of communious was that the third year's war [519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=519.12s)

and that route between the renaissance and what we call the unloud and the enlightenment um so yeah it's a deep it speaks to me if i'm thinking of a song this is a deep deep set of chord changes uh which are um uh yeah deep enough to bring multiple types of collaborative elements on top of [543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=543.68s)

this isn't a narrow thing that's hard to improvise with this is actually a large statement that can galvanize a a bunch of different endeavors um so yeah so i'm glad you guys started with that i'll leave it there because there's much much else to say so i think greg would go next double g yeah there is a lot to say [562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=562.48s)

it's a beautiful clip um i think if we if i now at the days think about the educational process i tend to think about it as skill development and soulman and transcendence which is another tripartite that i know that zach has educated me on in ways of thinking about our own development when i place it in my own context you [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=587.76s)

know i'm embedded in american psychology and i talk often about the problem of psychology and really it's a problem of american psychology and i believe that the problem of american psychology actually can be traced back to the enlightenment and it's fundamental confusion [606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=606.32s)

about the first person second person and third person the process by which we generated a third person matter in motion epistemics and how that scientific message and epistemology got dominant and then how we didn't know how to sync it up to a first and second person way of being in the world [629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=629.12s)

is absolutely essential and i think in relationship to this enlightenment if we are going to be so bold is to fundamentally create an opportunity to educate around all three perspectives to appreciate which each of those epistemic frames is about and to begin to generate sense-making systems that allow us to cohere and id just as you know i think that [651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=651.519s)

failure to do that is deeply deeply dangerous thank you thank you both zach and greg wg so i'll i'll put in in terms of a an idea that i have been developing of late cultural intelligence so in the course that i actually taught through the aligned center this past fall into winter [683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=683.76s)

there were three parts the first part was cultural literacy so what is culture what does it mean what does culture do right i also decoupled culture from race so the course was actually called cultural intelligence transcending race embracing cosmos and i did that move specifically because mixing up race and culture has [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=714.16s)

gotten us into all kinds of trouble uh since at least uh late 1600s also cultural literacy has to do with understanding certain developmental models both for a person and for societies and civilizations and groups honestly there but i know almost everyone on this call knows what [746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=746.88s)

i'm alluding to there's different names and different models then we need some case studies and in the course i used western culture american culture and black american culture as the case studies of culture in action and then in the last part i made it into the the personal the the more i part of the eye we it and to deal with certain issues with cognition and emotions and then with shadow and cultural somatics a need for us to deal with the reality of trauma and integrating that so that we can move forward and develop in various ways and then our spiritual [797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=797.839s)

vision you know your insolent zac um i think is a key part of that where we embrace um a more cosmic vision now that may sound woo-woo but i mean it in more of a philosophical sense like rooted cosmopolitanism we can have a rooted identity or rooted identities [820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=820.16s)

but we also at the same time can be citizens of the world and citizens of the cosmos that's where we come from we're star stuff so i think cultural intelligence what i'm calling cultural intelligence is a part of this cultural enlightenment that i totally agree is necessary so that's my comment and [842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=842.399s)

now we hand it over to the man himself who made the statement daniel i i don't think i said anything particularly original in that statement but maybe it was a a good starting place uh describing the need for a philosophy that is first second and third person i think many people [865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=865.92s)

have done i heard it from ken first of college um the couple thoughts that come to mind first is that this the thing that i'm saying is necessary is actually not all that lofty like an integrated metaphysics that actually gets beyond the or properly addresses [893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=893.44s)

the subject object distinction and the limit of the distinctions between first second and third person and formalizes all that like that would be nice but that that's that's not needed right talk about second person epistemology i'm talking about some very basic which is can i try to get where someone else is coming from [912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=912.079s)

and do a decent job of actually trying to inhabit what it's like to be them and what how they're saying things can i try to steal man rather than straw man like this is a very basic capacity but almost completely non-existent in the public sphere currently when i talk about the first person very very deep nuanced phenomenological insights [932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=932.72s)

are not that needed it's like can i pay attention to where i have motivated reasoning and i really want the answer to be one thing as opposed to something else and i want to be right and you know like i'm not that earnest can i just pay attention to and value my own earnestness enough um and then with third person again it's [951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=951.759s)

like before i share something on facebook about the virus do i know what a virus is as opposed to a bacteria or an exosome like just do i have the basic  about what i'm talking about and if not just study more a little bit so um i i would like an integrated metaphysics i would like to move in that direction [972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=972.24s)

but i would like more people that can hold uncertainty about the hard questions while being able to advance the basic stuff well i think sometimes the desire to be able to formalize the metaphysics actually comes from a certain uncomfort with uncertainty and wanting to be able to have some perfected or totalizing [996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=996.48s)

knowledge and i'd rather people who are like i don't know lots of fundamental things about the nature of consciousness and its interaction with matter and if it's purely computational or not or whatever but i can try to get your perspective and then i can try to synthesize the partial values and the perspectives to see how to move forward [1013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1013.759s)

when um the famous saying by von klausewitz that war is politics by other means the key is actually the opposite side of that statement that politics is how you sublimate warfare where for people who actually want different things and value different things and have different [[sensemaking]] of reality so and and warfare is so nasty and people who haven't lived through it have such a bad intuition about how nasty it is that to get that coming to compromise is actually a really important thing so i want to be able to unders i can't just demonize the other people try to get a short win and keep driving [1053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1053.919s)

cultural [[arms race|arms races]] and actually get anywhere good i've got to try to understand where they're coming from well enough that we can find some common ground because all the other answers suck and that for us to be able to remake [[open society]] institutions that derive their power from the consent of the governed [1074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1074.559s)

to be governed in order to consent have to understand the issues and so that means that they there has to be a culture that values understanding these things enough that we invest in it enough that that's possible and that's what i mean by a cultural enlightenment that's great that's great and i love how um as abstract and detailed as you can get i love the fact that you're like this is basically what it is and you know we can put various labels on it but if we can get people to steal man if we can get people to um as john viveki says do you know self-correction question their own  um and look at what you call base reality that's where it is but like you said in the public sphere in the public square this is so little there though there are as zac implied there are various movements going on in groups of people that are doing this so one of the things we tried to do for [1148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1148.0s)

this series is actually start with conciliants we started with a session called from matter to life to mind to culture where we had a physicist an evolutionary biologist a psychologist greg double g and myself dealing with culture usually those domains don't engage in [1173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1173.2s)

conversation so that was our attempt to actually model that what i'd like to ask you and zach daniel is for the consilience project that you've been working on for a year and that should be seeing the light of day pretty soon um what can you tell us about what we should be looking out for and [1201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1201.919s)

what we can expect because um it's a it's a real big deal and i want to honor you and zach and others who work on this project for having the courage to take a heroic step to not only analyze not only what's wrong but how civilization is going down the tubes but taking the step of trying to do [1225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1225.919s)

something about it to make sure it doesn't happen so i want to thank you for that yeah i think one just theoretical thing i want to say because um i forgot to say it i think it's a bit important i i just got off speaking with a group of retired congressmen and they were talking about [1248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1248.96s)

uh not just a breakdown in education in civics but any kind of cultural value in civic engagement or the moral development that's associated and you know when you read the founding documents here and any kind of thoughtful [[open society]] philosophy will say something similar is that [1266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1266.799s)

there is a moral education along with the epistemic education that's required because a democratic system of governance means a process of collective choice making where we all participate in making some choices supposed to have some ruler make it for us and the choice is informed both by what we value [1284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1284.24s)

and what we think is and the effect will be so the epistemics is what is what will the effect of the injunction be or the activity be but the there's also the values part and every system had some way of being able to bind the well-being of the individual and the well-being of the collective at various [1305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1305.12s)

scales tribes obviously had to have that and religion was a method of doing that and patriotism was a method of doing that that my sense of being able to have honor was bound to duty right that there's uh connection and obviously for a bunch of reasons some unfortunate some legitimate [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1324.24s)

things like religion and patriotism have kind of waned deeply as have local community identities and and the market idea right the kind of randian idea was just pure greed creates the greatest good for everybody because i only get ahead in the market if i produce a good or service that other people really want that benefits [1344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1344.08s)

their life at a better value that the rational economic actor consumes and of course behavioral economics showed us that that was utter gibberish because we can manufacture demand for nonsense and and it's way easier to make money through extraction than actual production and lots of other things and yet that meant the [1360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1360.32s)

the idea of binding the way the individual gets ahead with some kind of collective value is broken and the kind of market ideology said the invisible hand will just magically create good and it doesn't and so that kind of values base of culture you can see that it's missing right like right now neither the left nor the right [1383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1383.2s)

have a value on understanding each other they just have a value on appealing to their own base and demonizing each other that was just one thing i wanted to add well thank you for adding that i mean our our second session was values as energetic transcendence so we are really trying to you know hit [1404](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1404.24s)

to play the chord changes that are that are really needed um so thank you for that and that edition zach would you like to to come on in back yeah absolutely and to get your question greg i mean generally when one is writing a book wasn't and it hasn't been released yet one doesn't speak too much [1425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1425.44s)

about it but i can say that you so i don't want to jinx it but yeah yeah at the same time there are some things that can be said in general you know which are that um you know it's it's an educational project aimed at the foundations of our shared social understanding and so the focus is in many ways [1448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1448.64s)

the media the news right and what's happening in the context of the way that the world and its complexity is staged for us by the media right that the media gives us resources for [[sensemaking]] and these resources are insufficient and so some of what we're doing is pointing that out but only in the [1468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1468.24s)

context of equipping people with ways to both ask more of their resources in terms of like what they're getting to actually put a different kind of demand on the media but also to allow for the convergence of a movement around this shared sense that we're in an in an informational crisis akin to like an ecological crisis so and there is an information ecology of course and there's an information ecology precisely so the idea would be that there's kind of a founding move that needs to be made here in drawing attention to this the crisis in the information ecosystem and there are a group of people who already identify as those who are seeking to uh save the informational ecosystem to save reason and uh truth goodness beauty things of that nature and discourse communication um perspective taking the simple civic virtues that daniel was speaking [1532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1532.48s)

to which are not a given which do not necessarily emerge with each new generation they must be educated for and so yeah so it is that it is part media literacy part advanced situational assessment but larger part education and capacity building and model offering to in [1559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1559.36s)

to make that first move to to create a catalyst that can have ramifications into something like a broader cultural enlightenment not a lofty new metaphysics but in fact just new forms of civic virtue that get us out of this death spiral basically as which is what we're in as a culture absolutely when you say [1581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1581.84s)

new forms um will they be new or will they be is it a question of like what from what is in the past that we need to take forward what do we need to let go of and then what innovative forms can we come up with because certain things that we have let go we need to reclaim i mean absolutely yeah no we're in like a we're like a post-conventional [1613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1613.36s)

post-institutional moment where we are exactly being asked to um vet those aspects of convention for what they're worth and so it's not that we're creating something whole cloth new we're in fact rescuing the virtues of modernity and pre-modernity and jettison jettison jettisoning those that uh need to be like because they didn't have computers and printing presses and other things but the virtue in a sense was basic um and so again convenience right uh bishop of the bohemian brethren deeply mystical uh but uh ecumenical uh uniting trying to bring a sense of conciliance uh during war so yeah so there's a there's a very deep educational catalyst that's trying to be creative so i'll pause great come on in at any time man yeah actually daniel i was wondering uh if you would just share some of what you see is really hopeful about the conciliation where do [1682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1682.08s)

you see there's a lot of [[catastrophic risk]] where are you seeing some of the most hopeful opportunities i think it's been getting kind of surfaced here that uh there are things already happening that are signs of a nascent movement to a cultural enlightenment that just doesn't [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1711.919s)

recognize itself yet and so if you look at tristan harris and center for humane technology and all the groups that are looking at the way that there are unhealthy aspects of how the information ecosystem works [[social media]] et cetera and working to address that that's already a movement to identify [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1733.36s)

how [[sensemaking]] is broken how the fourth industrial revolution is not being rightly directed for [[open society]] or or even a networked society but it's just thinks that it's focused on the [[social media]] problem and then there are other groups that are focused on [[perverse incentive]] in journalism and trying to fix some of the [[perverse incentive]] in journalism to not have to have clickbaity titles and really short salacious things and there are other groups that are focused on how to get better education and civics to high school but they don't all realize that they're part of the same project right that [1769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1769.36s)

those are all focused on where there is where there are things that are actively damaging public [[sensemaking]] and or where there's a need for further development of it so one of the things we're seeking to do is to identify all the groups that are doing good work that is ultimately around that and to be able to curate and up regulate [1787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1787.2s)

the signal to those and reframe them as not just education or journalism or [[social media]] or identifying twitter botnets or whatever but as parts of this cultural enlightenment where you move away from the kind of sdg focus of here's all the stuff the world should do right the world should coordinate to do these things and you [1807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1807.44s)

realize well we should have done nuclear disarmament and we have not ever done that and we should have done the sdgs back when they were called the millennium development goals we couldn't do them like why do we suck at doing big global things that are critical and as we move into increasing [[catastrophic risk]] that's more problematic upstream from the question of what should the world do is how do we coordinate better at all the really critical things at scale and upstream from how do we coordinate better is how do we make sense of reality and communicate effectively prerequisites so what we're looking at is what are the missing prerequisites [1842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1842.64s)

that make coordination possible that make all of the goals worth having possible that's great that's really great um one of the things that i'd like to bring to our discussion is what was mentioned before regarding you know civic [1865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1865.84s)

values um i am very strongly influenced by the work of ralph ellison and albert murray both of whom were very high modernist and i think proto-integralists and you can even say proto-metamodernist and both of them had a strong allegiance to the principles of american democracy based on what ellison [1894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1894.24s)

called are sacred documents constitution declaration of independence bill of rights now for some who hear that who um perhaps are from the postmodern progressive perspective there may be a cynicism that arises because you know yeah you can talk all that you [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1917.279s)

all you want to but we know that that stuff you know isn't isn't true hasn't been true particularly for certain groups of people and i happen to look like uh the group of people that they're referring to but ellison and murray not only acknowledged [1936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1936.96s)

that reality they also had the consciousness and the awareness that having that beacon of light that beacon of possibility that's represented in those documents and the values and virtues of those documents is an energetic force in and of itself to move you towards it so even if it's inch by inch by inch and [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1962.88s)

then there's regression and then that's the reality you still have something to agree upon that we're moving towards and if you can agree up on that then we have somewhat of a common ground then you also have a need for a higher ground based on new developmental and post-conventional reality we have [1987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=1987.44s)

that too but we need i think common and higher ground and they were really aware of that so um we're gonna have to re-embrace some of those whole liberal values and i don't mean liberal i mean classic liberal you know what i'm saying so i just want to bring that because i [2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2006.0s)

think that is really important to voice zach daniel totally i mean it's yeah i mean there's so many directions to go with that the well the first thing i'll say is that there's a i'll go theoretical because it's easier for me anyway there's this issue in developmental psychology which can be [2033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2033.519s)

kind of like transferred on to the scheme of of historical development which is like transitional and enduring structures and development that there are these themes which emerge over multiple developmental levels over multiple years of your life which continue to be perennial themes which [2051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2051.679s)

you actually deepen right so like fairness on the playground fairness is about how many m m's does each kid get like literally count the m m's or johnny will freak out and he does because it's not fair if he gets fewer unless there's stipulations because he's smaller or whatever but there's agreed upon fairness this thing emerges all [2072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2072.24s)

all the way through adolescence and then if you study philosophy and you read john rawls you get a principled conception of fairness right so this issue of as history unfolds uh there is going to be in retrospect a lot of hypocrisy because earlier renditions of a perennial theme were [2092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2092.639s)

you know understandably limited in their first or second or third or fifth or hundredth articulation because this thing will not stop being unpacked that the things we think constitute justice now and medicine now and science now 50 years from now they'll look back on and be like whoa dark age yikes and yet they will still [2116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2116.0s)

be pursuing something like science justice right human flourishing hopefully if we if we succeed right and so there's this question of yeah how do we retrospectively uh render to our ancestors trust in the judgment that they had that they were actually doing the best with what was given to them [2141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2141.28s)

and then how do we see when in fact that wasn't the case and there was evil and there was mistakes right and so and that's a polarity but there's all of these shades of grey in between about the complexity of rendering moral judgment to the past and also the relationship between generations and so it's a deep issue that we are now [2162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2162.24s)

grappling with part of becoming i think hopefully a more mature species is that attempt at the full remembrance of who you are similar to what happens when you mature as a person right that like at a certain point you got to start dealing with your and uh if you don't you will limit your future possibilities by a lot your future [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2187.76s)

relationships your development of future capacities so there's a reckoning that happens with maturation and with capacity development a whole bunch of other things and so i'm kind of superimposing that as a historical lens but it's useful broad brush strokes to think like yes you know we this is apocalyptic in the sense of [2206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2206.72s)

everything being revealed that this is a time when we're trying to grapple uh with the full extent of history right it was a joyce waking up from the nightmare of history and so yeah so i don't think it's trivial but i uh to say that one believes in the founding vision of the united states um and i but i think it's important [2231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2231.44s)

thing that we're gonna have to figure out what what we meaning people who live within the geometric you know the united states system what we think about that kind of phrase because um that kind of phrase is actually tearing us apart and uh um yeah so i'll leave it there but [2249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2249.28s)

it's a deep again you hit a deep chord there and one that's going to like resonate across a whole spectrum of response and someone in the chat put the um our declaration by danielle allen harvard political philosopher who's one of my very favorite uh she's incredible and um i want to [2274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2274.0s)

thank that person for for mentioning that because i want to voice her i'm also wondering zach how does your meta psychology fit within the educational project i mean i it's in so far as i'm having an impact on how uh the conceiving and executing of the project is going it's it's completely woven in i i don't think it will ever be something [2306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2306.56s)

we explicitly teach i mean i don't i don't know but i doubt it but it is certainly part of the way we're thinking about it yeah i mean you know for example um image right uh visual literacy uh as an aspect of media literacy is huge and this is something i talk about with our editor-in-chief [2327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2327.92s)

a lot is the nature of the imagery and the way image captures personality words capture development mind skill image captures personality that's why the image of a man being kneeled on so much more powerful than just the words of a man being kneeled on right so the repetitive repeated re-traumatizing playing of the image in the media landscape is like [2351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2351.76s)

a kind of like a psychological torture that we submit ourselves to um because we're addicted to it and so there's a there's a lot of things in the aspect of installment that actually uh are being addressed but not head-on we're not like we're working on installment but we're actually working on personality character uh [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2370.8s)

value um and some of that will be not in the words about how the words are presented that the medium becomes the message that the nature of the design and imagery and those kinds of choices as opposed to it just being a cognitive uh linguistically mediated project and then of course because as daniel's saying we're curating the space we're trying to bring in the best of what we can find and build a movement a lot of my concern as a psychologist has nothing to do with what people are thinking and everything to do with what people are feeling and the way they're processing their emotions and [2408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2408.88s)

relationships and so i'm going to be trying to pay a lot of attention to those groups that are looking at the psychological and emotional precursors to even being interested in civil conversation you know what i'm saying like uh so yeah so there's a lot to do in these in these arenas so in that sense i think [2426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2426.24s)

it's it's it's very much informing the project but uh it's one of many models that are being uh used to uh shape the project daniel i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about you know sort of how you're thinking about ethics and values in relationship to the project [2447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2447.359s)

and is it fair to say i notice your conversation with brett when you got on this wove in and out with sort of foundational issues of value so if we think about the three points of view and also then think about the foundational values that we can be guided around [2465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2465.68s)

that to me always is seems to be of a super important place to find and create common ground and i see my friend mike muscolo here has built a frame around how to understand need and value so i just wonder if you could offer some reflection about value-based discourse um i'll start by taking something that [2494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2494.72s)

zach was just saying where he was discussing uh how media's affecting people traumatically or emotionally in addition to cognitively and just uh a decision that we had to make around that uh and how it reflected the value that we hold and then i'll get into the deeper questions early in the process there's a branding team that came on to help us they're like what emotions do you want to evoke with the site and i'm like no i don't want to evoke emotions this is the whole point is that that's actually the thing we're trying to cure is figuring out how to use scientific split tested optimization of images and whatever to evoke emotions for some kind of purpose i actually if anything i would want to evoke an emotion using a technique then show people how we did it just like do the magic trick and show them and say this is what is happening to you all the time here's someone on the left doing it here's someone on the [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2548.88s)

right doing it here's the market doing it here's a religious leader doing it now go look for this everywhere and have more immune system to this kind of memetic manipulation so cultural engineering the goal of it usually is how do we control the thinking feeling values and ultimately behavior of a lot of people towards some [2567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2567.76s)

specific vested interest our goal is cultural engineering of a different type which is how do we make all of that first type of cultural engineering not work anymore our goal is to obliterate the effectiveness of narrative memetic and info warfare and in order to do that it's how do and it's an asymmetric war currently it's you know trillion dollar companies [2589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2589.2s)

against a person who doesn't even realize they're engaging so it's how do we equip people better to recognize when those things are happening how can we equip them to notice when russell conjugation and lake off framing is happening or when statistical cherry picking of data is happening when [2608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2608.0s)

conflation is happening and also when the right kind of imagery and evocative dynamics are being used um so there is a value embedded in that for us which is seeking to increase the i mean it corresponds to when uh greg you were saying liberalism earlier what the core of it means that the idea of promoting liberty and the sovereignty of [2636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2636.24s)

the individual how do we actually increase the sovereignty of the individual against asymmetric forces seeking to co-opt it um because to the degree that we can get better and better causal mechanisms to affect other people's choice we're actually debasing the reality of their choice and an ethical system however we figure [2656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2656.96s)

it out is a system for making the right kinds of choices but it doesn't mean we take away other people's choices so to the degree that i compelled someone into an ethical choice it's no longer ethical right so our goal is how do we actually help nurture the growth of people who think [2672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2672.48s)

and reflect deeply on these things and want and want to talk with and listen to other people who are also thinking on them and we don't have to have an absolute ethical system like you know most ethical systems have reducto ad absurdum applications that show where they become [2689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2689.119s)

nonsense if your goal is a negative utilitarian and you want to minimize suffering you should kill universe because they're suffering the universe right and there's each of those different every form of utilitarianism has some weird edge cases like that so do values ethics and so [2705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2705.44s)

again there is a fundamentalism i'm not seeking i'm seeking people who can who can ground abstractions and felt sense and have a certain trust of their own reasoning and a trust of other people's reasoning to come to what the best emerging thing they can move forward with is we were talking with nora bateson today and i'm sure this is what greg would [2732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2732.079s)

want to hook you up on but uh you know her narrative around warm data um and the the context of the influence that you have inside of it in relation and attending to not the formulaic but the echoes of impact and the capacity to have grace and um sort of participatory flow in whatever that kind of [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2755.04s)

system is that rather than prescribing some complicated ethical code we have to be very very wary of of those kinds of things so i'm i'm hearing you infuse that aliveness and reflexivity in the best sense in terms of the kinds of propagating values that would enable us nora's work with warm data is one of the things that i hope we can [2778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2778.88s)

signal boost because she's looking at complexity from the embodied standpoint so not kind of the mathematics that are studied at santa fe institute but the complexity of how many different contexts and perspectives and nuance people can inhabit in the way they approach anything and i think it's more relevant to actual choice making specifically though any ethical system that gets formalized and optimized i believe becomes a [[paperclip maximizer]] and i'm particularly concerned with as people pursue enlightenment ideas and they go more rational you get instrumental rationality and utilitarian or [2824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2824.319s)

consequentialism and you can do the worst evil things in the name of utilitarian ethics because if i'm sure that the trolley's going to kill 100 people if i don't do anything then of course i'm justified in making it for sure kill one person but the real trolley problem that we're trying to make decisions about have way more uncertainty they involve [2842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2842.64s)

complexity where we say okay well i'm sure that agi is going to emerge in 20 years and i'm sure that it's going to uh get rid of all hydrocarbon life based on the von neumann morgenstern decision-making principle and blah blah blah therefore i need to um ship people's brains right now or and so we will make choices that risk really [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2862.079s)

terrible things or are willing to cause harm because of a worse harm that we're actually overweighting our certainty on and so bad epistemics combined with fear of the unknown and a desire for excessive certainty driving instrumental rationality is the name of a lot of well-intentioned evils and so we have to be careful with that daniel i want to push back [2887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2887.28s)

on one of the things you said before um greg double g uh asked you what he did about nora bateson's warm data and the pushback is the the idea that you can actually create images a model a process that is not going to involve the emotions i know you didn't say that it doesn't involve [2917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2917.92s)

emotions the implication of what you said is that you don't want to manipulate people's emotions and that's that's very admit admirable and you and and that's ethical but what we know about embodied cognition and for e-cognition is that you ain't you don't have cognition without your emotions [2937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2937.52s)

so one way or the other you're going to have emotions involved therefore you have to make some choices what type of fruitful emotions do you want this to evoke and if the emotion has to do with the kind of awareness what i think is an application of what i'm calling cultural intelligence the ability to discern [2967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2967.44s)

certain distinctions and how various forces are trying to get you involved in their narrative schemes for their purposes and being able to look at that as an object rather than being subject to it there's going to be emotions involved so i mean so i think you know i don't think that's [2990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=2990.4s)

realistic that's my pushback i don't think that's realistic at all so i can i can try to report on the amazon rainforest cutting in different motivated ways where in one way i want to make it seem like the world is going to come to an end tomorrow if there if one more piece of rainforest gets cut and the bolsonaro is doing it [3018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3018.16s)

out of like baby blood drinking evil and i can make an evocative thing that will just make utter horror and outrage but i can also do the thing that bolsonaro is doing which is to show how much jungle there is and the these few indigenous people in there and then all these poor farmers in brazil who don't get to actually make any money because all this stuff is protected for no reason that's keeping them from being able to access that land and i can invoke outrage at the exact opposite thing so and both of those are very partial perspectives and evoking certain kinds of responses for political reasons i would like to help make the clearest overview of the [3058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3058.48s)

thing that we can it's not unbiased it's bias corrected by trying to take all the biases right by trying to take the various perspectives trying to inhabit them trying to see what we can verify or see as true in them and then also what we can falsify or see as missing unwarranted or you know whatever basically a scientific process i mean [3078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3078.96s)

that's an element is the scientific process yeah in earnest because it's not science in that if i'm asking what someone's perspective is it's not measurable it's recordable it's an earnest endeavor into inquiry right and what i want people to feel is whatever the healthy natural emotion comes from seeing reality is maybe they feel sad maybe they feel some [3100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3100.48s)

anger then hopefully they come to some inspiration or hope or responsibility right but i want them to feel the real thing that comes from seeing reality clearly naturally as opposed to some manipulated emotion that i'm intending them to feel and then i'm manipulating what i show them to achieve that emotion i'm not trying to prevent them from [3121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3121.359s)

emotion it's just the emotion isn't the outcome i'm seeking so that i am what i'm seeking is their clarity and then there is a healthy emotional response to clarity um beautiful so you're trying to use third person i like your term base reality to then evoke first person [3142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3142.0s)

awareness of that base reality and then that's going to impact second person we space uh into subjective interpersonal dynamics in a certain way that hopefully now this is my this is my bias i have a bias towards um tipping a tipping point i have a bias towards a uh a group of people [3171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3171.119s)

and groups of people who will as happened in other enlightenments achieving a certain level of consciousness and culture together so that their thought words and behavior were aligned in a certain way that it can move the entire culture and society forward that may not be realistic but i think that with the critical mass [3199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3199.28s)

it can happen is that something that you can gravitate to daniel and and zach i'd like to say something about the previous point with uh what we've been calling the pedagogical atmospherics of the site right that the the long-standing mistake of the kind of like sciences of learning was to commit descartes fallacy right which is to separate [3228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3228.24s)

emotion from thinking and to believe that it is emotion that gets in the way of thinking and but in fact it's thinking doesn't take place in the absence of emotion it takes place in the presence of the right kind of emotion and so what good teachers do is create these types of emotional environments that are non-coercive [3249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3249.04s)

so the experience of the website isn't one of an absence of emotion it's the experience of not having your emotions manipulated okay which is not a non-emotional experience right like so like it could be a novel emotional experience it could this is what i'm saying that's why people like therapists so greg probably gets this like [3266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3266.48s)

therapists are also able to create a space uh ideally where you have a situation of not it's not that there's no emotion it's that you're not being manipulated emotionally but you are being presented with reality and concepts and and images and other things and so i [3282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3282.0s)

think the the trick ends up being not to make it devoid of emotion as if you can't do anything without emotion but those the right emotions to accompany that kind of thinking emerge this is what daniel said and so you know if um if you're trying to teach a child about moral development and you [3299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3299.44s)

read them a story that you think should evoke a moral response and it doesn't like they're just not moved by the by the heroic gesture of ethics uh you don't then force them to feel something you you find a story that resonates them until they're actually moved by the story and so that question that the teacher [3321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3321.44s)

knows how to not manipulate your emotion but get those materials in front of you in such a context that you experience the non-manipulated emergence of motion and so this is again this deep questions at the basis of what we're doing have to do with non-coherent forms of teacherly authority and that a subclass of that is non-coercive forms of emotional relation and so very touchy stuff in postmodern contexts where for the most part there is no such thing as legitimate teacherly authority and there is no such thing as emotional relation that isn't basically with a downside power dynamic in some [3361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3361.28s)

room in some way and so the ability for the therapist to hold more space and give you room to express your emotions is seen as actually potentially a manipulative power game which it is power but it is the power of teacherly authority which can be granted and so this is a very one of the things that is being nuanced in the pedagogical [3382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3382.88s)

atmospherics is that we are toying with this deeper issue of how can you have something emerge in our culture as it is which becomes a potential focus for a legitimate uh distribution and dissemination of teacherly authority and that's one of the main things is the reason teacher [3403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3403.839s)

authority fails is because it got localized and we need to find a way to distribute uh the teacherly authority this is something i'm passionate about um and i'll just say quickly yeah so from my vantage point i am working on a broad descriptive systematic metaphysics um and part of that comes from exactly [3423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3423.119s)

this point uh and that is enlightenment did not produce a coherent metaphysics basically and part of the postmodern critique which then seeps into the authority some of that is glorious in relationship to kinds of authorities that emerge but some of that undermined the concept of good teacherly authority in a particular [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3444.079s)

type of way and there are ways i believe to restore that both in terms of the kinds of processes and structures that we engage in at a process level and at an analytic level um that would bring some clarity but anyway i just wanted to so i i just one one thing one thing very quickly daniel i promise and and [3463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3463.44s)

reign we're we're going to be bringing people in shortly i just want to say that this process reminds me very much of ellison and murray's perspective on the blues so the blues can be viewed as third person based reality the reality that as murray says uh life is a low down dirty shame but at the same time you have to make a [3488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3488.559s)

choice are you going to and this is going to be an existentialist riff are you going to basically cut your wrist or are you going to go out and swing are you going to engage are you going to have what kenneth burke called a frame of acceptance of struggle of life of all the things we oh you're going to have a frame of [3512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3512.319s)

rejection where you say well that's wrong it's unjust it shouldn't be that way which i think is an immature way of looking at it um so there's some aspects that's in the black american blues idiom wisdom tradition that aligns very strongly and i just wanted to voice that i'm careful i appreciate that go ahead daniel go ahead yeah so i [3535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3535.839s)

wanted to add something um how we are addressing this teacherly authority topic because we don't have any authority that anyone doesn't grant and we don't want like ultimately we don't want anyone to trust us and defect on their own sense-making to us we want people to [3558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3558.96s)

develop better [[sensemaking]] that they can trust on their own so how how we're handling that is say we do [[sensemaking]] on a particular piece we're we're trying to make sense of what's going on on the india china border or whatever it is so we have the piece but then we also [3577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3577.839s)

have how we came up with our [[sensemaking]] on it so what data sets did we look at what epistemics did we apply what are the other views and what was our [[sensemaking]] on their views so we actually make our epistemics crystal clear and then we allow people to criticize them so we can say if we missed [3597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3597.44s)

something if we included some data that was false or we missed some critical data tell us if if we find out that you are right we will publicly update it and credit you if you want that if not we'll show the position so we're not attached to a position we're attached to the best earnest process we can we're making it transparent [3614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3614.559s)

if you want to take this process fork it modify it somewhere else you can it's public commons sure and so the goal is to help people develop so it is developmental right it is to help people develop better capacity but where they get to have full transparency into that process and then the other part i want to say [3636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3636.48s)

about emotions is in so far as there's an emotion i'd like to induce beyond just the emotion that naturally arises from seeing what there's to see i think there is a kind of epistemic nihilism that is pretty ubiquitous where people don't feel like they could make sense of what's going on and so it's hard to make sense of what they should do with their life or how to vote or how to apply their time or anything and if someone was to have any experience reading or they start to see the possibility that emerges of making better sense of things that they have a certain kind of epistemic hopefulness start to emerge [3673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3673.52s)

an inspiration not an inspiration in some answer out there but an inspiration in their own capacity to increase the basis of their agency which is their capacity to make sense of the world if there's any emotions specifically that i would hope would come about it would be that one [3689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3689.839s)

that's great can i interject here because the teacherly authority bit is key like one of the signs of legitimate healthy teacherly authority is that it is trying to make itself obsolete like the good teacher is trying to give you exactly the skills you need to no longer [3706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3706.559s)

need the teacher and the good therapist is trying to give you the skills you need to no longer need the therapist they're not trying to keep you addicted to them as the authority that's not teaching that's something else that's not actually teaching that's just the authority and one of the [3723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3723.119s)

ways to think about propaganda you'll never actually know all you need to know to replace the propagandists behind design small problems with so-called conspiracy theories in any case the the broader point there is that there are many indices how do we tell the difference between legitimate and illegitimate teachers the authority [3743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3743.44s)

and that is one of them that it seeks to make itself obsolete uh and so this is precisely what the conciliance project is seeking to do that in fact we're trying to show you under the hood exactly what we're doing so you can have that sense of being empowered to step into their own your own [[sensemaking]] and uh rather than just having to keep [3763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3763.2s)

to come to us uh and so i think that's one of the dynamics that you find in the media currently is you're addicted to the to the trough like you go keep going back to eat more of the like high fructose news stuff and that's just an egregious uh violation of the obligation that the media has [3786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3786.48s)

which is to you yeah go ahead i'm sorry so you you'd like to in my own words increase people's sovereignty not to become rugged individuals but to become self-determining in their own [[sensemaking]] in terms of like what they actually think and feel not based on the manipulations that are [3809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3809.359s)

all about them in the media sphere including advertising and pr but to really take a look at you know what do i think what do i believe and why and that's powerful i also want to say that that goal of uh the teacher you know teaching the students so that [3832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3832.48s)

the student goes beyond the teacher that goes back a long ways doesn't it i got that from dewey i got that from dewey because dewey was like all right y'all you because people were inspired by dewey and they made all these crazy schools where they just let the kids do whatever they wanted basically the absence of teacherly authority in [3847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3847.92s)

the wake of a very strong critique of due to the authority which created chaos and kids who never learned to read or or anyway so he was like okay what constraints on freedom are legitimate he's like those constraints on freedom are legitimate which uh basically set you up for greater freedom if you hadn't had a [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3868.319s)

constraint put on you right so the idea is like you don't want to allow for freedoms that end up putting the person in a situation to have fewer freedoms right so it's about that dynamic and the eventual uh you know graduation of the of the student into uh the lifelong learning journey that the [3892](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3892.319s)

teacher puts them on rather than being locked into a set of ideas which just holds them the rest of their life and they're basically caged in these ideas and those ideas come with an identity and then the the ego becomes attached to the world view and then [3908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3908.799s)

you're in that place where for a long time psychology thought that brains didn't change after the 20s and 25s and that people didn't change and part of it was because there was a there was a calcification of the identity and cognitive architecture as a result of i think certain forms of schooling is this we this would be dewey's i'm basically recounting dewey's argument [3927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3927.359s)

here about why we cease to continue to develop and grow so yeah that what what you learn from your teacher should be that you can go on to have many teachers and to to move up and out and up and through so yeah there's a there's a beauty to that way of thinking about [3946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3946.559s)

constraint and authority right that in fact this is the very stuff of intergenerational transmission and uh cultures that can exist in perpetuity have figured this out um and we are in a crisis of teacherly authority and intergenerational transmission rain there are some questions i think so [3967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3967.28s)

yeah maybe we'll go to questions um i've got some good questions in the chat i'm going to jump around a little bit uh to kind of follow the thread we're on so since we were talking about teacherly authority rob hart has a question uh which i'll repost in the chat here um rob do you want to ask your question or [3992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=3992.319s)

if uh zach spoke to it a bit um so if you'd like to modify it at all please go for it yeah i think zach did start to answer this and i would love to hear him kind of deepen one of the ideas he said about freedom but the question i originally said was what do you think is the best thing that a teacher can want for the student and the world and use their teacherly authority to produce in the students journey and so i i have really enjoyed your use of the tripartite model and i've kind of seen each lane of this tripartite model of of our psychological development as a way that we approach sovereignty or a way that we augment sovereignty in our lives the sovereignty of sort of the uh the the way that daniel uses it and i i'm curious if that relates to what you mean by freedom um and if the whole panel could sort of weigh in on what what they believe to be the highest good that a teacher can seek for the student using their teacherly authority [4058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4058.079s)

uh i'll begin and i'll try to be brief because i think i've spoken a lot so so margaret mead wrote a book called culture and commitment and in this book she suggested that there were three kinds of cultures there were cultures where it never really changed and you were basically going to inherit what your parents had and their [4078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4078.72s)

lifestyles and their ideas and things and in those situations it was very actually easy to know what as an elder one should teach the youths it was precisely what they needed to know to do what had been done for centuries right and then there's a second form of culture where there is some change but not that [4098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4098.799s)

much change and enough change where you can actually teach kids to how to expect certain kinds of change and there there's a more collaborative relationship and this is what the era that margaret mead believes she grew up in right um which was uh like world wars and but she came to realize that there's [4117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4117.199s)

a third form of culture where in fact things begin to change so rapidly that it becomes very very very difficult if not impossible for the elders to know what to teach the students they that the students will inherit a world that the elders literally do not understand and they become aware of that fact and [4137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4137.52s)

so there's a like this weird reversal this is actually the root of the roof of the youth rebellion and the intergenerational crisis is the fact that this something like this has occurred and we don't know how to negotiate this as educators but what it means i think is that the educator's responsibility is to allow [4155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4155.44s)

the student to find the problem that is theirs to work on it's very vague so you need to allow for enough freedom such that and enough support such that the project that of the the project of their life right the image of their life to get to the meta psychology aspect of it that you're working on [4177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4177.279s)

who will you be in the future and the elder says i cannot imagine and the youth says now i can because you've given me the resources to imagine right beyond what you're capable of imagining so that's the responsibility it's not to determine for them or to pick out of some slot of jobs that we're aware of now or something like that right it's actually [4197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4197.92s)

to give the resources of judgment and discernment resources of imagination because we're in that situation of not being able to imagine what it will be like for them those who come after us who will not be like us who inherit this world that we've created with its hyper objects and its risks so yeah i think that in [4216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4216.0s)

that sense that freedom is there but it's a letting go which many parents know but we're having to exercise at an intergenerational level which is very complex so that's uh i'll leave it there i'll very quickly say i think we need to teach young people how to improvise because [4237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4237.04s)

when you're dealing with double binds and you're dealing with uncertainty going to have to improvise but i don't mean winging it i'm talking like jazz improvisation where you've got to have the chops you're going to have a lot of knowledge you got to have you know a lot of grounding in base reality in history [4258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4258.64s)

and knowing know thyself and go back to that um because at certain points you're just going to have to in the moment make choices that one hope is is the wise spontaneous choice in the improvisation that's part of a model that that my wife and i through the jazz leadership project we look at improvisation as wise [4288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4288.32s)

spontaneity so i would just say that um and for that you've got to not only support but you've got to challenge them you've got to give them structure but you've got to give them a certain amount of freedom within the structure to express and to experiment and to make mistakes and then [4308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4308.159s)

learn from those all of that so i really think it's a balance of those those elements hey let's jump to tyler wakefield you just asked a question that got some plus ones it's on the topic of education still but a different angle when it comes to the institute the institutional aspect of the academy [4332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4332.32s)

if you'd like to ask your question and open to zach or daniel to respond hi yeah if anyone wants to respond to this i was just um you know um we've been talking about you know and maybe an educational enlightenment um but you know i'm wondering when a lot of these uh [4360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4360.08s)

these processes that are developed whether it be journalism or um other sorts of propaganda come out of you know the university structure people educated within it i was interested uh what you know what's to be made to the academy are is is this a movement that is going to exist outside of it is that the expectation because the institution [4382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4382.239s)

simply can't be repurposed to to do this type of interdisciplinary thinking or is this is there an idea that this movement will eventually permeate into the academy or is that necessary um i just you know what a great question that we need about two more hours to [4403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4403.12s)

laughter i'm not touching that i'm not in the academy so i'm going to let uh let those that are or have more proximity to it to uh to answer that please um well i'll i'll just say i'd like to hear daniel's take on this well i'll say briefly if somebody uh has two professor parents [4425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4425.92s)

in the audience even um and grew up in the academy um my hope is is that there is a zeitgeist of awareness maybe spurred on by covid that we are in a major cultural shift and that the structures of modernity um as both terrifying and glorious as they were i think there is the hope of an increasing conscious [4453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4453.44s)

awareness uh that maybe transformation could happen that's being in some ways very optimistic because i also have a pessimistic side that sees an enormous amount of inertia and static and stasis and indeed you know i find myself in these circles now uh following jordan hall and zack stein [4474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4474.239s)

and daniel schmuckenberger as opposed to my sort of standard academic friends precisely because of the mentalities and the structures that are at place certainly my own work in the context of america what i call american psychology what it became how it was established and what it might become is very much something i'm passionate about and i believe that if the consciousness raises and the sensibilities that emerge and we start to cultivate a wisdom commons about how to educate folks for the new next generation there may well be a very very strong impact a wave of impact across the academy so that they begin to restructure um it's definitely needed and it is my deep hope that that potential might emerge i'll go ahead and say something and then we let zach end with it since this is uh his topic in more depth i don't think we can consider the restructuring of any of the major institutions in isolation because they are all inter affecting so obviously if the purpose of schooling is to prepare people for a workforce then that's a very real constraint how much of the tax money can actually be invested into the education if most of the people are going to be laborers like what education is relevant to be a [4570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4570.08s)

laborer uh well with technological automation creating a massive amount of job obsolescence in the next while largely in the labor fields that's both a risk and an opportunity what could it portend for different kinds of education so also things like what is it what is education [4593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4593.36s)

in the information singularity post information singularity when you've got something like a hundred thousand peer-reviewed journal articles in each field per year come out and there is no such thing as an expert in any domain anymore and so to be an expert has to be increasingly hyper-specialized microfields which also means increasingly poor [4619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4619.12s)

understanding about any of the kind of broad topics but the broad topics then end up having those who focus on have the problem of a lack of the depth where the devil in the details ends up mattering and so then we start looking at how can the right kinds of computational infrastructure machine learning etc not replace but [4637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4637.199s)

augment human capacity and what do we want to train people to do both when we don't need the people for labor in the same way and we also don't need the people for all of the compute but there are things that people are uniquely good at and it happens to be that the things that they're uniquely good at and that we have intrinsic motivation around [4653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4653.44s)

largely coincide so factoring the change in the technological and economic base in association with the educational base is the way i would say is the beginning of starting to think about this and i mean we definitely don't have the answers we have a lot of design constraints and some of the answers and this is why the goal of a cultural enlightenment of more people starting to think deeply about all of the institutions that need restructured and how to do that uh has to happen but it's like okay well how do you how do you go against the direction of [4695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4695.84s)

market incentive well the market isn't going to incentivize anything that goes against the market incentives well the state could but the state ends up getting captured by the market interest it's supposed to regulate if it's not regulated by the people so ultimately if the if the market [4712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4712.239s)

incentive is not flowing in the direction that you want comprehensively where is the change going to come from it can't come from the market alone it can't come from the state that isn't grounded in the people it actually has to come from culture which means people valuing something other than what the market currently values enough to reform institutions [4730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4730.0s)

that can guide market type dynamics and so the thing we're interested in doing right now is how do you actually even just take the people that are already sympathetic to these ideas and gather them somewhere which obviously this is one example of provide better education resource information processing [4749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4749.92s)

and the ability to work on these problems in in more collaborative and effective fashion and i think that is kind of what a cultural enlightenment that ends up leading to the reformation of institutions usually looks like i'll say a couple things one is that well it depends what you mean by academy because there's at least two things [4771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4771.04s)

happening there's higher education which is sometimes just an extension of high school as a necessary upper stack on the public education system and then there's the academy where there's something like supposedly ongoing knowledge production right and these things two things are often happening in the same so-called university which is this [4790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4790.48s)

massive especially a state school this massive research uh complex that is doing both higher education and academics right academics being you know independent research in the humanities and science et cetera so these two things right both of those are in radical crisis right now [4810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4810.719s)

covet really complicated an already debt-riddened higher education complex in the united states so we're actually no matter what we do intellectually over here we're looking at a very different higher education coming in the coming years higher education i said higher education this [4830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4830.239s)

is about what we do with those people who are exiting high school all right uh the question of what's going to happen to high-level knowledge production is also extremely interesting this is where we're getting to daniel's point about computational um assistance to human judgment at the edge of expertise and a whole bunch of other things that [4851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4851.04s)

are coming at the academy pretty fast and hard and the radical de-incentivization of the humanities like this that's another crisis in higher education is the absence of from a market perspective and even political perspective sometimes uh doing really solid work in the humanities like ethics and political [4870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4870.8s)

science and stuff of that nature so yeah so i am kind of avoiding answering the question in a concrete way and say and saying like there's so much indeterminacy right now in exactly that region that it's not clear i could see a mass homogenization where you get like 12 big brands of higher education who've [4889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4889.84s)

consolidated all the little players and you get kind of a centralized probably state subsidized system but i could also see just a radical fragmentation wild west market-driven pseudo-higher education with pockets of amazing stuff so i think the answer is we'll see we'll see uh um there's certainly not right now from where i sit uh anyone knocking on my door from the academy telling me that there's a groups in the academy organizing around this i see them hunkering down trying to preserve the old system and business model which is i think going to fail so brand new thank you get one more daniel yeah um [4939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4939.44s)

chris d i just reposted your question if you're here feel free to unmute yourself yeah hey guys thank you so much for this conversation my question has to and my attention is the concealing project challenges legacy media legends media gets a lot better at being ethical and delivering high quality [4960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4960.8s)

information so where do you see the best case scenario for the conciliants project on its impact on legacy media and how are you going to deal with backlash from let's say not only the traditional institutions but also the memetic tribes as well thank you jack you want to go first all right [4981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=4981.52s)

document i want to write and put on the side i'm not sure if we will but i i like the idea that is called something like predictable responses and it identifies the predictable responses of the various memetic tribes and you know if you are uh in the queue anon tribe you think that uh this is part of the deep state cabal [5005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5005.92s)

because somebody in our advisory council is three steps connected to epstein if you are part of the woke crew you think that we are giving voice to racists rather than canceling them by hosting dialectics with people on the right um you know those kinds of things and then say if you had a response arise that was [5024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5024.4s)

anything like these and it was and that you're kind of adjacent to that group you're not actually thinking you're just a memetic propagator right like there is a stimulus response process happening in you and you should be concerned about that like you should want to know that you're actually thinking see if you can come up with a response other than the one predictable by your social sphere um so that's one answer on by the way by the way i could just i could just feel that there were people triggered by what you just said and if not in this group yeah on the video you know so but i mean [5062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5062.96s)

hey you need to get a response but but i wonder and please don't lose your thought but i really wonder if another way of going about that is not just the presumption that you should not be caught by a particular narrative but the steel manning maybe this way the steel manning is so powerful if you can [5092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5092.239s)

voice uh with integrity the perspective and maybe lawyers do this naturally of others you disagree with me seems to me that's such an incredibly important step yeah i mean it's it's pretty straightforward to argue that the political opponents that you [5118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5118.719s)

disagree with don't stop existing because you cancel them or because you ignore them or because you call them idiots or terrorists or communists or islamophobes or whatever it is to dismiss them they don't stop existing and they don't stop being political actors and if you polarize them against you they're also smart and paying attention [5138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5138.88s)

to what works and if you win they reverse engineer the tool that won and use it next time so if you want to keep driving cultural [[arms race|arms races]] keep doing that but just do the math on where that goes with [[exponential tech]] if you want something other than a cultural [[arms race]] don't be so myopic temporably myopic that you think [5157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5157.199s)

winning this time actually matters very much and then say how can we actual the respect for these humans is actually obligate there is no way forward on a shared planet without without getting rid of them and we can't get rid of them so you know how do we how do we handle that so yes you can explain those things i think actually making the point that i [5180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5180.239s)

don't think most people want to think of themselves as being more predictable than a gpt-3 algorithm and yet most of their tech speech is more predictable than the gpt3 algorithm most people's text response wouldn't even pass a good turing test because they're so following certain memetic tropes and [5201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5201.679s)

to have people think about that is actually a valuable thing now the mainstream media question an analogy that i think is an interesting one is it was supposed to be that the market worked by people having demand for things that would actually increase the quality of their life creating an evolutionary [5228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5228.239s)

niche for supply supply would emerge and you'd have competition of who could provide the best product or service the best price and then everything gets better but of course as soon as supply side is organized and demand side is not organized and it can exert force and to be able to manufacture demand manufactured demand broke the intelligence of the market right and so you can't say well let's use demand to change supply because demand isn't coordinated so it's an asymmetric war and the supply side wins so sometimes you have to use supply to change demand to change the rest of supply and that's what i see that elon did with tesla [5263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5263.52s)

and electric cars before tesla there just was not a big demand for electric cars and so he was able to make a car that was interesting enough that demand went up enough that now all the other car companies are making electric cars faster than they would have been otherwise [5280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5280.32s)

our goal is to show what good media could be like what good news could be like in a way that makes demand for something that doesn't currently exist that people know that actually creates an incentive for other news organizations to do better news because there's a better educated populace actually demanding it where right now they have an authentic [5299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5299.36s)

market incentive that's been erased to the bottom because people actually click on the more salacious click baity stuff and so we're hoping to be able to educate consumer patterns of media enough that it actually changes the topology of the markets to make the supply side have better incentives all right rain had to sign off so i i'll manage a few more questions as long as we don't maybe do one um i think it was jason killinger is jason yeah hey um hi so i asked um the first uh the first second and third person development that daniel you spoke of um that greg played at the beginning [5344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5344.96s)

um also speaks i think to values and i'm wondering if while we're waiting i mean obviously we have major leaps that we need to um take in media and in education and i'm wondering if there's kind of like a fast track um base level that we need to get to that's on that speaks to those around values that [5369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5369.76s)

if that's like the kind of place we can immediately go i'm wondering if you have any thoughts on on on that and kind of like movements or people that are that are getting us that are kind of like taking care of that level right now that we can kind of put support behind [5388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5388.0s)

i don't know that i understand the question exactly but uh i think i understand a part of it so what are the values that are involved in what we're talking about and what could be done or is already being done on values development work oh i i guess i mean like finding um finding this coherence like on the basis of values like like a thing that keeps coming up for me is like um i keep asking people like um do you love where how far do you extend your circle of care like those kind of things that i think are are kind of like a ground floor towards like a you know cultural enlightenment yeah i think um the process you're describing of [5443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5443.84s)

dialogue that looks at things that are shared rather than different first and uh build some kind of shared life experience commonality value i think super valuable one thing that we're doing early on is the second person [[sensemaking]] is largely about values it's a it's it's what is [5468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5468.88s)

so let's say for instance i'm there's some issue where there's a polarization around whether or not this particular proposition should go through and it seems to be uh around something that if it does will benefit the economy but damage the environment and if it doesn't the environment will be preserved but the economics won't get ahead or [5489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5489.6s)

whatever so we can identify well what are the values independent of the strategy proposition a yes or no and the values are i actually want my kids to be able to get a better job and then the values over here are i want to have this last little bit of old growth for us protected when we identify what everybody's values are first almost everyone can empathize [5512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5512.4s)

with everyone's values if they aren't bound to a strategy where they're in a theory of trade-offs where valuing your value requires going a particular direction and a proposition that messes up the thing i'm more directly connected to so can we separate the values that we're seeking to serve from a proposition of how to serve them then can [5530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5530.56s)

we all hear everybody's values and then say is there a proposition that would serve all of them better that's a key reformation of the democratic process and it was actually the goal of a town hall and scale just messed it up is before you get into voting on a proposition was it even a good proposition did you do [[sensemaking]] to help bring that about and a big part of the [[sensemaking]] is not just what is but what are all the things that people care about connected to this so one of the things when we're sharing different narratives is not just what are different people think is true but what is it they care about that is ultimately motivating them [5564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5564.159s)

that can engender the empathy of each other i really think that's a very very key shift and move you know it's foundationally you do this all the time in therapy what is the care what is the value and how do you hold multiplicity of different values and then look for adaptive synergies [5582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5582.159s)

across them in some of the solutions so but that value piece and then empathizing with that steel meaning honing it relating to it is a crucial process i know forrest has been here and spoke before and he's done the best work i'm aware of on what that democratic-like system could be of [5601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5601.76s)

getting all the values to inform we're we're not doing anything that advanced in terms of trying to actually formalize the governance system here we're trying to actually just at the communication layer can we even understand the values where other people are coming from are we seeking to do that and in the media pieces we're putting out [5618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5618.8s)

um are we helping make explicit when we steel man the positions both the partial epistemic truth but also the values that they're holding yeah great i think you said farts i think you you're talking about forest land tree correct that [[sensemaking]] is ultimately an ethical and value-laden [5638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5638.8s)

process that and this is habermaus's point ultimately that there's this thing rationality which you can do by yourself on a desert island which is just about manipulating the world but then there's this thing called reasonableness which is about how reasonable you are and how balanced and comprehensive and [5656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5656.8s)

how much respect basically you showed to those who in who who you're in discourse with and so there's this key base and daniel said it like you know respect for other humans is obligate like not because you'll go to hell or whatever but because uh if we keep amplifying the cultural war we will create a situation of inevitable uh self-induced extinction so yeah there's this base notion of reasonableness rather than rationality for example and the reasonable includes the emotional right it's unreasonable to exclude emotion although it could be rational for a little bit of time to exclude emotion but it's completely unreasonable [5698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5698.84s)

to make continual demands on the exclusion of emotion so there's a there's a deep um basis of values at the root of [[sensemaking]] and in my model of course you get the insolent and trans and development and transcendence but you begin with you know the root of the value of self and other yeah i like the word justification a lot but so let's do one more yeah i think we have one more question uh evan mcmullen is is on deck if you want to unmute and ask yourself evan all right thanks can you guys hear me yep yep cool so this goes back uh a bit in the [5738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5738.239s)

conversation to when you were discussing teacherly authority and so my question has to do with um i'll just read it so my question says that it seems that one of the thorniest issues related to this issue of teacherly authority is that the fact that most of us were coerced into an educational system where the source of [5756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5756.32s)

teacherly authority was ultimately not epistemic but the threat of physical violence and coercion and so this seems to have created a trauma surrounding the teacher student dynamic and many if not most people in our society and so i wonder if you have any thoughts on how we might address that as individuals small groups and [5773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5773.199s)

as a society at large i can handle that daniel do you need to run if you look like you needed to run like you were bowing out i can handle this if you need to go this will be the last question unless you're interested what i'm going to say but you can probably predict it the uh yeah you're absolutely correct that in fact the crisis of teacher the authority we're in um is not contrived and artificial and kind of like made up it's a legitimate crisis of teacherly authority that for a brief period of time the modern [[nation state]] was able to instantiate a form of teacherly authority that was unprecedented just world historically um [5810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5810.0s)

and this was what comenius was cooking actually back in the 17th century and but that was just a window of time when it could be sustained in america in particular by something like a civic religion where in fact your high school teacher was a potentially inspiring uh in like put there by the state who was this admirable thing that you were [5832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5832.88s)

supposed to like those days are gone like the the screen won and schools lost and that was just the nail on the coffin of teacherly authority that had already been degraded for a long time in part because of the inability of the school systems to demonstrate their problem-solving capacity which is to say no child left [5854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5854.0s)

behind and a few other things which made it clear to all the students that like this is not working like we can tell you adults actually don't know precisely how to run this enormous urban school district in terms of the way you're distributing money and other things so it became very transparent and the most reflective intelligent [5872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5872.88s)

middle school to early high schoolers usually either strategically manipulated the system in order to advance themselves or just cynically checked out essentially and so that means we're in a situation of having to deal with the downstream consequences of a multi-decade-long crisis of teacherly authority in the [5894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5894.56s)

schools and so that means people don't wouldn't recognize good quality teacherly authority if they saw it and that's why people are actually susceptible to pathological forms like cults and spiritual teachers that are corrupt and things of that nature so yeah so i i don't know how to kind of de-traumatize that but i do think that [5913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5913.28s)

music some of it has to do with those pedagogical atmospherics on the site that there needs to be explicit and clear just how much we're putting in your hands and that we've got nothing under the table or under our sleeves or somebody behind the curtain pulling the strings [5930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5930.48s)

on us that in fact you are seeing it and then it's all on the table and you can enter like peers into a relationship and that's what every child would love like to have been able to do when they reach a certain age of self-reflection would be able to say hey what do i who do i and how do i and they begin to ask their questions and they begin to pursue it instead of being forced to sit in an uncomfortable desk for six hours a day being talked to by a woman who's not smarter than your mom who's only there because her issues paid and you know what i mean so there you are uh [5969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5969.52s)

so it's kind of a cynical note to end it on but well and on that note no i i know you got to go and we're getting near daniel uh do you want any offer any sort of summary thoughts or reflective thoughts for us to chew on as we i think i talked to plenty i would just say thank you [5992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZqeVh2Exs&t=5992.48s)
