music welcome to heart based medicine's heart of health care podcast featuring daniel schmacktenberger co-founder at neurohacker collective a systemic approach to heart-based medicine thank you daniel thank you for being with us today thanks for putting this together we had a chance today to talk about [19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=19.119s)

heart-based medicine during the board meeting and during the opening ceremony and i just wonder what does heart-based medicine look like for you if you were to describe it in your own terms now the first kind of sense that i have is that people are called to a life path in the [45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=45.28s)

healing professions because of a care for the quality of experience of other people and the actual sacredness of human life and human experience and wanting to be in service to and devotion to that so heart-based medicine would be where the entire system of medicine and all of the [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=69.36s)

interactions were designed from and in service to that devotion and that sacredness so heart based medicine is about a sacred space for you yeah i mean we think about medicine being preventing and correcting illness and promoting health people's experience of life and what [96](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=96.96s)

they can do with their life to affect the experience of others is sacred so then medicine is what is in service to their capacity to experience life fully and contribute delightfully beautiful in many ways this is where medicine is coming from at least in our part of the world in our cultures that medicine was very much in the domain of [118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=118.079s)

the religious missions and that was the understanding of health care that was the understanding of care given and of of elevating the potential of of the ones we serve is this something very specific to to our cultures or is this something that you see as a like as a principal [140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=140.959s)

beyond the kind of cultural and religious backgrounds that we share in western europe i think this might be as unifying a thing across cultures as there is in terms of medicine women and medicine men and shamans and chinese medicine and ayurvedic medicine led early humans figuring out how do we care [164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=164.64s)

for each other how do we care for ourselves how do we prevent illness how do we fix illness obviously the whole focus to do that would be not just self-preservation but also care for each other so i think that's probably as unifying a thing as there is yeah so care is the unifying principle so it cares the unifying principle and [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=189.92s)

we see that all the talk in healthcare about the importance of care and we see how it is delivered what do you see as the current the strongest obstacles if you like those those elements in our current healthcare system in the way that we go about healthcare what do you see as the [217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=217.599s)

current obstacles to deliver the kind of care that we would perceive as a secret a lot actually i'm i'm happy to unpack this but there's a lot of systemic factors there's obviously trillions of dollars flowing through the thing we call global health care industrial complex [243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=243.12s)

we're at large and pharmaceuticals and hospitals and industries and insurance industries there's also all of the money in the world flowing through things that affect health when we look at uh the burning of coal and oil and what that does to the environment that then we're embedded in and breathing and [265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=265.12s)

drinking the water from when we look at agriculture that depletes the topsoil or sprays glyphosate on all the food like upstream from someone being sick and coming to the hospital is do we actually have a civilization that's promoting health and how many places do we have a civilization that through [284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=284.08s)

structures that create ubiquitous psychological stress and structures that actually again expose us to ubiquitous pollution and poor forms of nutrition when you just think about that like the the goal of almost every business is to maximize the lifetime revenue of the customer [304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=304.08s)

and nothing does that better than addiction obviously the the supply side might be a multi-billion dollar company relative to an individual consumer and so there's a kind of asymmetric warfare in terms of their capacity to influence with commercial media you know so many things so if we wanted a society that was [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=323.68s)

promoting maximum health we would want to be minimizing addiction everywhere which would mean that any place where addiction was profitable we would have a fundamental conflict we'd have a [[perverse incentive]] in the nature of that type of market dynamic so you know i i think there's a huge amount [345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=345.36s)

of [[perverse incentive]] that's one place where there are structural issues i think that there are places where out of caution because of malpractice and whatever else hospitals create policies there are insurance guidelines that actually don't allow doctors to do things that would demonstrate certain kinds of care [368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=368.639s)

i think that we have a medical school system where the average amount of nutrition that is taught to a medical doctor is extraordinarily low relative to the importance of nutrition and health but similarly how much psychology should actually be taught so that the doctor can actually really understand [388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=388.8s)

the experience of the patient well and be able to relate and work through that should be a much bigger percentage of the training that occurs i think we also have a situation where you can't actually measure the felt sense of love and care in the same way that you can measure cholesterol and blood pressure and so [411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=411.919s)

you end up optimizing for the things that you measure i think mri machines are expensive and they're important so you make big hospitals that a lot of people go to as opposed to small county clinics and because there's economies of scale but i think the economies of scale mean you don't really know your doctor your [429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=429.919s)

doctor doesn't know you you're one of maybe hundreds or thousands of people that they're going to see and so i think again the economies of scale end up really damaging personal connection and personal rapport i think the most important diagnostic tool there is is really detailed medical intake [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=447.599s)

and really having the time to think through and pay attention and then a continuity of being able to think about that for the patient and there's just that requires a certain amount of time being allocated so i think there's a lot of structural factors that are oriented to things like [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=468.56s)

lowering liability and maximizing profit and economies of scale all of which are not optimized for what supposedly the whole thing is in service to thank you that makes a lot of sense can resonate very much with the importance of a work of an intake that is based on a deep listening really being present with the patient understanding where they're coming from and seeing their disease through their eyes where you're talking about you're touching on many issues but you're also touching on one of the points you're raising is that the person's [[subjective experience]] of their disease and how they feel and what it means to their lives is something that is worth exploring and yet it is hard to measure so the measures that we currently have available are are they too crude or are they just is it just structurally impossible to measure the [535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=535.2s)

[[subjective experience]] well by by definition it is structurally impossible to measure [[subjective experience]] a measurement means some needle move means it's in the domain of the object or third person i can measure a neural correlate i can measure a endocrine correlate otherwise i have to actually listen to [560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=560.32s)

the person report their own experience then of course we're going to have all the biases that self-reporting has and someone having reasons they don't want to say how miserable they are or they want to exaggerate it for empathy or they have a limited vocabulary to express it so i do think that there is a need for a [584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=584.959s)

lot of question asking of things that cannot be measured in blood tests so how do we deal with this approach so we we know that when we talk to patients that we find out things and as you say there are biases so there's there are preferences there's recall there's you know there's all sorts of things that affect this and and a lot of the approaches that we take [608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=608.64s)

in in everyday routine clinics is trying to bring some insert some objectivity into this assessment seeing to what degree can we rely on this but in a way what we do is we take our tests that we apply our observations of that person that we call objective observations we take those as the reference point and [632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=632.0s)

whatever the patient says is measured against that yet when i hear you correctly then what we really want to do is we want to improve on understanding the [[subjective experience]] better okay so there's there's a number of parts we can look at here there's the way that someone's [[subjective experience]] affects their objective physiology right so the whole domain of psychoneuroimmunology and the way that stress affects health and the way that better psychological disposition placebo dynamics et cetera effect health so we want to actually be able to work with people's [[subjective experience]] as part of medicine that's one thing [675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=675.92s)

the other thing is that some people might have a disease that can't be cured and actually still have a good [[subjective experience]] of life based on their focus and their [[meaning making]] versus having a totally ruined experience of life so [[subjective experience]] is a terminal value in and of itself it so it is both useful for [694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=694.959s)

supporting objective physiologic health and it is intrinsically valuable independent of physiologic health there's a bunch of other reasons to talk to a patient and ask them questions though you and i were talking before that modern allopathic medicine does a really good job in places where we actually [718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=718.0s)

understand the causation clearly and generally that tends to be more in the direction of things that were acute like an acute injury it's pretty clear like oh there was a puncture wound we're going to sew up the puncture wound or um there was an acute infection and we can see what type of infection it is maybe an antibiotic can treat it or [737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=737.839s)

there was a acute poisoning and we're going to do an acute kind of detox but there was a acute incident and then immediate symptomology and we can trace causation but with autoimmune disease and with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric disease and cancer that's not the case and so for the most [758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=758.32s)

part we don't actually know why those things are happening and it happens to be my belief similar to much of the kind of functional medicine and naturopathic world that most of those diseases are multifactorial they don't have one cause they have a lot of causes and it's not the same set of causes [780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=780.88s)

every time so there actually isn't one thing called rheumatoid arthritis or one thing called ms from a pathoideology point of view there's a system that's being exposed to things that don't create immediate symptomology but that are dysregulating homeodynamics and those dysregulated homeodynamics make one more susceptible to the [799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=799.279s)

additional stressors dysregulating homeodynamics more until eventually we cross a threshold and now we get symptomology in biomarkers and a cluster of symptomology and biomarkers gets a disease name and but if i really start paying attention to those things and wanting to be able to trace a complex causal situation that's multifactorial [824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=824.32s)

and maybe very delayed causation in time then i want a totally different kind of intake right i might want to be asking really detailed questions to see when they've ever been exposed to mold or when they were ever exposed to industrial chemicals or they spend a lot of time with epoxy at a certain point or whatever it is or when they had third [844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=844.72s)

world travels where they got nasty infections and what symptoms so i want a timeline of when different symptoms kicked on and a timeline of different kinds of stresses and exposures when there was a micro-traumatic brain injury that didn't show up in an mri but it doesn't mean that there actually wasn't a micro tbi that affected functional [861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=861.44s)

patterning in the brain and if i'm able to look at the current symptomology the current labs the progression of symptomology and the progression of exposures and have all of that fit together and make sense then i might be informed as to how to start a treatment that is actually addressing more than just symptomology [882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=882.839s)

and you know disease manifestation and there's no way i'm going to get that without asking them a lot of questions yeah so so is there do you do you feel that this is this is an area of research that is developing i mean i think that the environmental medicine functional medicine naturopathic medicine [907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=907.04s)

communities have been focused on with chronic complex illness in particular where the best modern treatments are mostly symptomatic you know and not not just symptomatic a biologic can actually decrease the total tissue damage from a connective tissue disorder and [928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=928.8s)

obviously if we're cutting a cancer out or radiating it out or poisoning it out that's still better than leaving it there oftentimes but the why was there increased carcinogenesis in the first place and why did the body's immune system not deal with the carcinogenesis are still upline questions especially if we don't want this person to get cancer again [947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=947.759s)

and especially if the things that might have led to it might be signs of underlying dysregulation that affect other things so i think there is a increasing awareness that chronic complex illness is not just stupid bodies um it is just a kind of deeper complexity where it's not [968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=968.399s)

one disease one cause and we're going to have one pill it is radically complex regulatory systems many different elements of causation that end up leading to things that present like a cluster of symptoms and biomarkers that we call a disease that is very fascinating i think in most [991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=991.36s)

of the research that we see published today most of the clinical research is lists that we see published today what i observe is that the the schematic the methodology is very much the same so we kind of have two up two points of observation and between the two points of observation we assume a linear correlation [1011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1011.44s)

but what we don't look at are here if you look at the classic table one in a publication where we're looking at the demographics comparing the two groups you know three or four or five different variables so we're looking at you know is you know gender ethnicity age so like really really crude variables [1031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1031.76s)

and at the end everybody feels comfortable that both groups are comparable well what we're not looking at at all is what happens before the trial what are these life stories what is this what is this the the complex of homeodynamic regulatory systems interacting with each other and and [1056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1056.799s)

building up in a way that that we have great difficulties to understand that we certainly don't have any measures or markers for this when we establish these let's say if we get better at asking questions and really getting at least a reported picture of what happened do you feel that the if we basically exploded the number of variables [1083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1083.919s)

from you know age and sex and ethnicity to to maybe let's say 200 or 500 variables so if we were compiling this index of of measures or indicators would we really learn more about what happened before an event um yeah so what are the right methods to gain the kinds of insights we want in a domain as [1118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1118.72s)

complex as human physiology is a very interesting question if we look at a clinical trial say for drug research that's trying to see does this drug do something beyond the placebo we're going to get something like a gaussian distribution where all we you know it's going to work pretty well for some people [1140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1140.88s)

and it's going to work not well for other people and there will be some range of effects for a lot of people we just want to see that that some range of effect and maybe the front of the bell curve is better than what a placebo is but why it works really well for these people and not really well for these people or maybe even really badly for [1154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1154.32s)

these people is a bunch of other variables that are just hidden under the shape of a bell curve and so obviously we would like to find that out so that doesn't mean that that is a worthless study that's an interesting study but it if we go all the way to the other end we get [1176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1176.32s)

how can we get as much information about this one person as possible rather than this one drug across all people right how can i get as much information about this person and now we're starting to do n equals one kinds of studies and optimization so i totally think there are places for clinical trials of course if we have more metrics if they're [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1196.64s)

appropriate metrics additional insight comes because not just are you likely to be able to see more things but you also start to get to see what are the relationships between these metrics and are there combinatorial insights but as soon as i realized that i'm not just looking at a genome i'm looking at the combinatorics on all of the polymorphisms possible on all of the the genes and then all the combinatorics on the epigenome and then the proteome recursively changing it we're never going to be able to compute all that it is actually not computable so there are better ways we have to think about how do we actually understand what health is and if we think about health as the integrity of the regulatory systems so the homeodynamics of how the body self-organizes and self-regulates and the homeodynamic not just the homeodynamic state but the homeodynamic capacity right like typically most of the [1258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1258.08s)

studies that most the tests we do in medicine are testing state so we're testing cholesterol level or we're testing blood sugar or whatever it is but what's really going to determine the overall health is much more related to under some kind of stress how does the body maintain being within a homeodynamic range so [1277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1277.44s)

you know we do this sometimes with a glucose stress test or with a stress echocardiogram and those are super insightful but there's a lot of things we don't do those with where it might be in range but very fragile and could come out of range easily which means that the person doesn't have a disease but they're very susceptible [1294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1294.96s)

and so yet if i see very high homeodynamic capacity across lots of axes that's a measure of the robustness of health so yeah different types of interesting diagnostics in the future thank you so when we are so what i hear from you is assuming linear [1322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1322.0s)

uni causal association is is a degree of simplification and that silly is really not very helpful um i mean for some things in the knife wound case it's fine yeah except we need to ask you know are they clumsy or are they getting in knife fights for dumb reasons so there [1349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1349.84s)

might be something upstream but so for some things unicausal is fine but for most anything that emerged not immediately following an obvious causation event this is why we don't actually have real cures we have symptomatic treatments and um you know ameliorative treatments for most complex chronic disease music so the etiology of disease we will more likely find answers for what is the real cause of disease if we look at nonlinear models and we look at the the period before the disease started before the symptoms occur and see what what are the different factors that have built up and reached that threshold yeah [1399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1399.44s)

when you speculate about what might be the areas that affect the human body what are the areas that if they stack up will lead to an imbalance of dysregulation that becomes symptomatic yeah what do you believe are those areas you know there's some actual pretty simple models we can start to look at this comprehensively through so [1433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1433.36s)

i mean chinese medicine and ayurvedic medicine actually had some kind of good holistic heuristics to start with even though they didn't have all the assessments we have but like say you take a roughly chinese medicine point of view of where is there too much of something or is there not enough of something so [1453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1453.919s)

toxicity and deficiency this is pretty good starting model for predispositions towards disease so you can think about that we evolved to be able to like our genetics evolved to have a certain set of behaviors interacting with a certain set of environmental parameters so where our behaviors are very different then kind of what we evolved to handle or where our environment is meaningfully different those are going to be interesting things to look at so you know too much well too much can look like things that we shouldn't have any amount of like glyphosate and pesticides and you know [1499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1499.2s)

and we're really kind of ubiquitously exposed to the volatile organic compounds coming out of this carpet and out of the paint right there's we have built a world that we're actually not genetically fit for where there are externalities to our health of the ways that we do lots of things and so when you look at all the volatile [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1522.32s)

organic compounds or all of the you know petrochemicals that are in the environment most of them are either endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins or carcinogens so then we look at how many diseases fit into those being part of the underlying ideology right so too much of things that shouldn't have really been there at all [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1540.799s)

and but obviously too much sugar or you know there can be excesses of certain nutrients in relationship to other nutrients like zinc copper balance or calcium magnesium balance or things like that obviously we're not just limited to talking about environmental toxins that aren't alive we can also talk about things that are alive so infection would be kind of a subclass of too much of something and that can either be things that should be there but they're overgrown like sibo and other kinds of microbiome disorders or actual infections but [1580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1580.72s)

pathogens that are not normally part of our healthy kind of microbiome and this is where the concept of a subclinical infection or a subclinical toxicity is important which is let's say that i have a level of mercury exposure or a level of lead exposure where we're [1601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1601.279s)

going to say oh yes i have lead poisoning well lead poisoning is at this threshold but the ideal amount of lead that i would have would be down here well there's a whole level in here which is i don't yet have the level that we would diagnose with acute lead poisoning that is more than none it has some effect and that also ends up being true with infections that are not necessarily showing up as acute infection but are testable and that have effect so we see helicobacter pylori in the stomach being able to cause ulcers and cause stomach cancer over a very long time period or h pv and you know cervical cancer or [1637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1637.2s)

throat cancer things like that for those few that we've found recently it's pretty safe to assume that there's lots more like that where the correlations are just not as clear yet and that's one of the things that again some of the infectious study and environmental toxicology studies that functional medicine is doing i think are really [1656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1656.88s)

interesting um so too much of various things not enough of and obviously we can look at things like not enough exercise not enough sleep not enough music human contact the none of human contact is actually profound because [1676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1676.88s)

that ends up being one of the most profound drivers of addiction which is then going to cause so many other health issues but also not enough of specific nutrients and we see that we have a you know modern american diet or modern industrial world diet is very high in macronutrients and often [1702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1702.399s)

low in really critical micronutrients and longevity is usually best optimized by lower macronutrients and higher micronutrients which is closer to what [[evolutionary environment|evolutionary environments]] would have so that's like a starting framework thank you so here you have identified areas or risk factors [1724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1724.0s)

and if they're compiling they might add so these are the areas that we would like to explore further and more deeply in in an intake as you described where we ask lots of questions and try to understand what happened before the patient has reached a stage of disease yeah when we don't have a lot of time when talking to the patients and you [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1744.96s)

mentioned the the systemic factors the limiting factors of how we are setting up our healthcare system certainly i i feel that limited time is a critical factor we need to make choices we need to make choices about what questions to ask and one way is to go through a protocol one way is to go through a long list of questions and kind of ask all the [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1773.6s)

possible questions and then hope that either ourselves or some computer will be able to make sense of it and then there's another way to make choices and that depends it involves the observer it involves the healthcare provider so it involves the way we show up as a [1792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1792.32s)

healthcare provider we relate to the patient and we ask these questions we briefly touched on um the [[subjective experience]] of the disease and you taught you touched on homeodynamics as as the key principle to understand behind disease evolution now if we see that you're a homodynamic system and i'm a homodynamic system [1818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1818.08s)

is there a way that those two systems can come into resonance is there a way that i can tune my system into yours and by doing so i can actually ask the right questions i wouldn't ask you as a clinician have you had this experience yeah yeah that's what it seems like i don't think we have to get hung up on wondering what the mechanism of [1844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1844.799s)

intuition is to acknowledge that there's a reality to it is it some electromagnetic resonance that's happening maybe that's a cool idea is it simply that i have a lot of experience and when i take the time to quiet i process the information in my own internal neurologic database better that's a fine [1865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1865.36s)

idea too i don't really i don't i actually don't want to attach to a mechanistic explanation of how intuition works that someone can say not well enough verified and reject to say that increasing awareness and presence and perceptivity is valuable and it will lead to better insights from [1889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1889.2s)

wherever that comes about what's going on with the patient and how to ask the right questions that's interesting so you're leaving um care as a sacred space and you're leaving intuition as a sacred space so it feels like we need to talk about [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1917.12s)

love in a way connecting the two at least that's what it feels like to me here's another sacred space and another question of can we measure or should we measure what might be the value of measuring how we relate and and how we describe the phenomenon of love or resonance [1945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1945.44s)

we talked about this earlier we can't measure love we can measure things going on with the physiology when we say that we're feeling something that we call love that maybe statistically correlate to some degree and whether i'm measuring oxytocin and other kind of neural hormones and neurotransmitters or i'm [1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1979.12s)

measuring heart rate variability or measuring some kind of eeg coherence pattern those aren't useless things to do like that's interesting um but i could just say pick the right person to marry on paper whether you have any feelings for them or not and just snort oxytocin regularly [1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=1999.76s)

because love is just oxytocin and most people don't resonate with that or or you know do a particular kind of transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain region that we identified as where love is happening and there it is um when a parent wakes up who is sick and who hasn't slept in a long time who has [2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2025.84s)

an infant who's worn out as can be to take care of their infant love is motivating them but they might feel like in the moment and love doesn't really feel like a subjective emotion it's actually something deeper than emotion it's transcendent to emotion it can move them even through emotion we might not see a you know [2046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2046.64s)

the particular great heart rate variability in that moment or whatever it is um so i think it's interesting to study correlation between physiology and subjective states but i think if we're studying it through the method of science and we can do a lot more with the objective within the method of [2068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2068.48s)

science because that's what we study things that are measurable and repeatable and experience [[subjective experience]] is not immeasurable nor repeatable then the temptation is going to be to reduce subjectivity to being an epiphenomena of objectivity and in doing so then consciousness is illusory and choice is illusory [2090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2090.72s)

or their consciousness is real as an epiphenomena but choice is illusory because everything that happens in the brain is controlled by particle physics of the voltage differentials of sodium ions that's the exact opposite of heart based anything right like that is kind of maximum reductionism and it's not even [2109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2109.04s)

epistemically well-founded it's a category error of seeing that there is some pretty low degree of information theoretic correlation between objective and subjective pretending that it's perfect and then pretending that this is the epiphenomenon of this one because this is the one that we know how to actually make causal sense of [2129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2129.599s)

do i think it's important to have some way of noticing how the doctor and how the nurse and how the practitioners feel before they're with patients and they're paying attention to how the patients are feeling and they're paying attention to the quality of the relationship totally i don't think you can measure that i think you can pay attention to it i think that you might have some indices that are worth noticing but there will be meaningful things that can't be brought into an index and the moment you do you're actually collapsing something very information rich to something very not information rich and you're losing [2168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2168.96s)

so much information in the process that if if you make your decisions as a hospital or an insurance company or a doctor based off the thing that lost all the information and then you normalize this is the thing we want to do we'll mess it up it's beautiful so so basically our our attempt [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2187.52s)

to simplify questions so that we feel comfortable to answer them um so this reductionist approach um limits our ability to see just by the by the fact that we're setting targets to see them yeah the dow that is nameable is not the eternal dial so ultimately good medicine is not [2214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2214.88s)

purely algorithmic and our job is not just to try and be robots that just get data that we just haven't got good enough robots to do yet but will be replaced by them and then do if this than that um programs it's actually not that that's not the job that's a part of the job but that's definitely [2238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2238.96s)

not the whole totality of the job so there is something to what medicine is that is trans algorithmic and so then you have to say well if we're going to be training doctors and if we're going to be evaluating them based on a set of metrics and the scorecard so then they [2258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2258.96s)

are going to try and perform to the scorecard they're going to mess up the actual thing this is what the note this is how i interpret what the no false idols thing is about right is that that that kind of graven image of that set of metrics isn't [2274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2274.96s)

actually the thing that it's pointing at it's not worthless to pay attention to those things but you actually have to have your choice making be bound to the actual reality not the information-reduced model that's very interesting particularly when we think of [[artificial intelligence]] entering the space of medicine [2295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2295.04s)

so when we look at now there are computers being built that are exhibiting some features that we would describe as compassionate for example non-just mental listening so some of the robots are now able to listen to a human being and in a way that they there is a feedback to the one that that is that is talking but it's non-judgmental [2326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2326.96s)

this this is um there's a conflation of ideas in here to say non-judgmental assumes a binary with judgmental that where we're derived we're correlating our experience of a human that is judgmental or non-judgmental that computer is not being non-judgmental nor judgmental there's [2348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2348.72s)

actually no one home there is no quality it is doing an if this than that kind of program and even if it's doing a deep learning program it is simply a fully causal input output through some set of program dynamic so it's not really fair to call that non-judgmental it is doing a function he's doing what [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2370.079s)

it's told and the interesting observation is is that when people with certain disease conditions for example autistic people are interacting with these computers there seems to be a level of trust or acceptance that evolves and that those [2396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2396.48s)

patients exhibiting features that we would describe as autistic disease spectrum will reduce and they will be able to open up and actually start a conversation i think that that is a statement of how shitty the parenting is and how shitty the doctors nurses and educators are that the person does [2418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2418.319s)

better with a robot like a fairly low level robot rather than it is something exciting about ai for me if someone's doing better with a robot because it simply doesn't seem judgmental and it takes a little space even though it doesn't love you or care about you like that's just a really low bar i'd rather the person have a dog [2439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2439.28s)

to spend time with the thing i'm excited about with ai and the medicine space and it's it's confusing to even call a machine learning do we want to have machine learning run big data sets to find correlations that we can't currently find of course that's awesome do we want to like scan all the medical [2459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2459.04s)

in you know medical records in using image recognition and run massive big data so that we can see early disease indicators we don't currently know that's awesome insofar as and and of course we should be augmenting just like we augment human memory with [2482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2482.24s)

books and computers we should augment human computational process with computational process so the ability to take a picture of something and have image recognition be able to do better diagnosis of skin is like all of that's great and that actually allows as that gets [2498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2498.16s)

better it allows the doctors to be less focused on just memory and computation and more focused on actual connection to them know how to use that system and to relate to the person but there's still going to be a pretty big gap between the doctor relating with the person using the system and the system acting on the person [2519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2519.28s)

directly so you now you know music juxtaposing the human experience and the development of machine learning or the availability of machine learning capacity and we can run this on databases as you say but we can also turn them into we can we can inform [2547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2547.599s)

objects that we call robots with machine learning abilities so they're able to provide services so what we're seeing is that increasingly now there are kind of robots evolving that are involved in what we typically would cause called services of care so for example they would help in in household activities they would help in you know basic getting dressed washing ourselves very basic um day-to-day activities and they are helpful for people who have um incubus you know are somehow um don't have the capacity to perform certain activities but they're fundamentally different to a [2599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2599.44s)

nurse coming to the home and actually being with this person and providing that support yeah there's something about the development of these technologies that is awesome and liberating and helpful and there's something about the way we are relating to it that is gruesome and it's important to understand both in [2620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2620.48s)

so far as we're talking about a robotic exoskeleton that can allow a paralyzed person to walk it's just a better wheelchair like i mean it's just an extension of the tooling we've already been using um you're wearing eyeglasses that's a tool that helps you you're a cyborg to some degree um [2640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2640.88s)

if we had ones that could autofocus and do cool stuff like okay that's fine but something that does not actually have the capacity to care about you replacing a dynamic where care used to occur is tragic now if it's simply helping you get some stuff done you couldn't otherwise and [2666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2666.96s)

hopefully that increases your capacity for authentic human interaction awesome that the tendency of hyper individualization that the modern world has had modern west in particular has had every time you see a mass shooter who shoots up a bunch of people at school or somewhere almost all of the [2684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2684.64s)

time when the news goes and checks the neighbors say yeah he was super quiet he kept to himself nobody ever saw him because in a setting where you have a family or an extended family or a village where humans evolve for most of human history if you're before you would go kill a bunch of people you're obviously not happy and if you're interacting with other [2704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2704.319s)

people to get your needs met other people see that they'll actually be responding and keeping that psychopathology from progressing that far but if someone can be a shut-in and they can hardly ever interact with anyone and maybe get an amazon drone delivery to their house so they actually never have [2720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2720.16s)

to interact with anyone now they can have some robotic care agents they can progress in psychopathology both in ways that make them dangerous to society and in ways that just allow them to be suffering gruesomely for a long time humans are social primates we evolved in social environments we have a world that totally is getting [2739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2739.68s)

this wrong right now and we we have to turn that thing around for their not just to like have an optimal world i actually don't think we have any chance of having a world continue at all from the point of view of existential [[catastrophic risk]] if we don't solve this particular thing because [2760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2760.0s)

say someone is progressing in psychopathology and they're really upset and the best technology for killing they have is a knife they're just not going to hurt that many people before somebody takes them out but if it's an ar-15 they can kill a lot more people with decentralizing exponential technology when that becomes a crispr [2777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2777.92s)

gene drive pandemic weapon and weaponized drones and etc we just can't have really disaffected people and that means if i can get all of my needs met without interacting with other humans then either i have to have some top-down state surveillance system like the china method which is already a [[dystopia]] or how do we have access to the level of technological power people will be getting and have us be safe vessels for having that much technological power well they have to be no psychologically really damaged people and if there are any we have to know the only way to have that kind of known that doesn't involve top-down [2820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2820.319s)

state surveillance is the kind of surveillance that a family does or a tribe does or community does where my resource provisioning requires interacting in healthy ways with people or unlike the kind of asymmetric surveillance of the state that is just trying to make sure i'm not a bad guy it's a symmetric paying attention to people that actually want to make sure [2837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2837.44s)

i'm doing well so part of the what you're proposing is a community surveillance in a way so are you saying basically that doesn't even have to be developed because it's it's an innate function of building um primate communities that we're resonating with each other and that we're realizing if somebody is behaving [2859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2859.92s)

kind of outside of the pack then then that is something to be addressed and is would you argue that this is something that is as like an existential interest of the group because of the potential so is this like a risk detection system of a group does this mean that nobody can be a hermit no of course it [2881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2881.2s)

doesn't mean nobody can be a hermit but it doesn't mean that in the presence of decentralizable catastrophe level technology we have to think about some things differently than we did previously and the disposition and well-being of people matters more to everyone because the [2906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2906.24s)

one-to-many capacity of a person is much much higher and so the coupling is higher which means that the care needs to be higher music we're coming back to care again and again and again so now we're looking at care as a group phenomenon so a group caring for the group and caring for individuals for the sake [2928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2928.079s)

of the group and for the sake of the individual and for the sake of the individual so if i'm just translating this to the health care setting now where we have a group of people working together and we have individuals walking in and out of this setting and we look at the current i want to call it epidemic of [2949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2949.359s)

suicide in you know among our colleagues where are we failing is it have we become numb has the system numbed ourselves have we lost a sensitivity you're specifically talking about suicide amongst doctors i don't know i haven't studied this i would want to really look [2979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=2979.599s)

at is suicide much higher amongst doctors than other professionals of the same pay grade and other types of similar stress level um like i'm sure again there's going to be complex causation that's involved it's not one thing we can talk about why there are kind of epidemic suicide issues society-wide [3009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3009.44s)

but yeah i wouldn't want to speak to with doctors without knowing more but i think it's pretty easy to see at least some things i think it's pretty easy to see that the amount of stress doctors go through even in med school right experiencing burnout or being on some kind of uh [3037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3037.44s)

wellbutrin or adderall a ritalin or some kind of upper just to make it through school by the time they're just not even graduating and then they're supposed to have a whole career of that and like you mentioned 72 hour shifts and i also think that not having a place to process the emotionality of it the desensitization of okay so i just [3058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3058.16s)

you know was a part of some kids dying today this experience and i'm gonna go do it tomorrow and where's space for that and yeah i think i think there's obviously a lot of stresses both that are unavoidably endemic to that profession that need to be processed in ways that they aren't currently [3080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3080.64s)

processed and ones that are avoidable by changing the way the system works so we could as a group become more proficient in detecting the dynamics of the group and taking care of each other and we could become more proficient in the way that we show up as an individual in the group and that showing up more proficient with our peer group with our teams and with the patient will help us to see the patient better see our colleagues better and that might create a community that is kind of mutually supportive in a way that we are not so much cluttered by by knowledge [3130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3130.559s)

and red tape but we can actually allow ourselves to activate our natural capacity to care and and our um i feel like to to allow ourselves to be authentic in our natural state of being and connect at that level yeah i mean it's interesting when you're talking about the [3162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3162.24s)

group care between doctors colleagues when when someone that we know commit suicide it's such a important inquiry especially if we didn't know they were close it's an important inquiry to recognize that you actually don't know how close anyone you're talking to ever is to committing suicide [3186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3186.4s)

and you don't know how close to threshold they are and how your interaction is going to affect their relationship to that threshold and simply being aware of that changes the importance you put on how you show up in all the interactions so much well we've come a long way in looking taking a big circle [3208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3208.88s)

starting in what does it what does heart-based medicine mean to you and uh we're ending on a note of how important it is to develop a sensitivity for each other and to be present with each other and to know and and how in in so how many ways this this uh finds reflections in our diagnostic capacity [3231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3231.76s)

in the way we devise treatments in the way we want to create a healthcare system that overcomes the many limitations that that we're facing at the moment towards a system where people feel seen and heard as human beings rather than being seen as a disease with with some kind of background that really doesn't isn't so important for us thank you [3261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPumhxH3JHA&t=3261.359s)

thank you for taking the time being here thanks for having me thanks for uh following the call to help this movement birth we're on it together thank you thank you this has been a heart based medicine production thanks for listening
