so let's take facebook and [[social media]] and the way they've affected the information commons and the [[epistemic commons]] are at large so we know that the nature of the algorithms optimizing for time on site while being able to factor what i pay attention to the whole tristan hair story makes almo very few people wake up and say i'd like [25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=25.519s)

to spend six hours on facebook and so i'm going to spend more time on facebook if i kind of leave executive function rational brain and get into some kind of limbicly hijacked state where i forget that i don't want to spend my whole day on facebook and so time on site maximization appeals to existing bias and appeals to limbic [46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=46.719s)

hijacks so if i piss off and scare the whole and and elicit sexual desire and whatever of the whole population while doubling down on their bias and creating stronger in-group identities associated without group identities the algorithms optimize well it is an ai of the power that beats cast [65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=65.28s)

private chess beating us at the nature of the control of our attention so we can see that the right got more right the left got more left the conspiracy theories got wackier the anti-conspiracy theory people became more uh upset at the idea that a conspiracy could ever exist basically everybody's [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=86.799s)

bias doubles down and they all move apart from each other faster well society doesn't get to keep working that that is a democracy killer right that's an [[open society]] killer there's a reason china controlled its internet is if you don't want your society to die you have to be able to have some shared basis of thought so we can say and the story is oh we [105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=105.92s)

didn't know that was going to happen well you go back and look and guys like jaren lanier were at the very beginning of facebook and google whatever saying hey guys this ad model is going to  __  everything up like you can't do the ad model thing you got to have paid for subscription or you know some other kind of thing and i was like shut up dude [124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=124.88s)

um and or just don't even engage in the conversation and then get to say afterwards failure of imagination but now how do you regulate it when those corporations are more powerful than countries because some the regulation is going to be happen in a court where the lobbyists have to be paid [141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=141.44s)

for by somebody right so who are the lobbyists paid for by and it has to be supported by popular attention and those who can control everybody's attention can also affect what is in popular attention so this is a very real example where we know the harms were not and and it actually got large enough that it killed the regulatory apparatuses capacity absolutely um in fact again this is going to be another alignment of our maps so what i've been playing with is the idea that we are incorrect in imagining that people necessarily want their uh their expectations flattered that people [179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=179.599s)

actually may like to be challenged but that it's inconsistent with the well-being of advertisers that the very fact is because advertising is only a tiny fraction informative and is mostly manipulative you have to be in your unconscious autopilot phase in order for it to cause you to buy a car you wouldn't have otherwise bought [204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=204.239s)

or buy different deodorant than you would otherwise buy and so the point is in order for us to be the thing gets paid for by advertising in order to be useful to advertisers we have to be unconscious and the only way to keep us unconscious is not to challenge us basically to tell us what we think we already know rather than [219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=219.599s)

what we need to know and so they're lulling us into this even though we would still be interested in the platforms if we weren't being advertised to but we would be interested in having more important conversations there which is really in some sense what the uh the growth of heterodox podcast space is about [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=238.64s)

oh my goodness okay there's two directions i want to go at the same time i'll just pick one there's a [[reward circuit]] on [[exercise]] and there's a [[reward circuit]] on junk food and they both have a dopaminergic element and [[reward circuit]] but of a very different kind and the [[reward circuit]] on [[exercise]] is that it actually feels like  __  at [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=261.68s)

first and it's hard and but your baseline of happiness measured in whatever dopamine opioid access whatever gets better over time and then you start actually feeling over time but not quickly this is another place where um temporal myopia ends up mattering because there's a delayed causation on the healthy one and no delayed causation on the unhealthy one so i start getting the [[reward circuit]] on [[exercise]] when i start seeing results and then i want to push hard and then i'm willing to actually go against entropy and put energy into the system so the energy grows whereas the chocolate cake i get a reward [299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=299.84s)

instantly and i don't have to apply any energy but as i do it my baseline gets worse and this is the like addiction versus health [[reward circuit]] direction and the same is true for scrolling facebook compared to reading an educational book at the end of a month of reading the educational books my life feels better i feel more proud of myself [319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=319.84s)

at the end of a month of scrolling facebook i'm like what the  __  am i doing with my life and and yet that one will keep winning for the same reason that 70 of our population is overweight and over a third of them obese and so but not but my only hope is that not everyone who has access to too many calories is [340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=340.08s)

obese right like there are some people who figured out hey that's a [[reward circuit]] i don't want to do and i'm going to [[exercise]] and i'm going to not eat all of the fat sugar salt that evolution program need to have a dopamine hit for because it's a shitty direction now we need to get that number of people who actually [357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=357.919s)

have taken some sovereignty over their fitness and well-being in the presence of the cheaper [[reward circuit]] we need to get that number up to everybody because right now obviously overweight is one of the main causes of death in the developed world but we have to then apply that to the even more pernicious [[hypernormal stimuli]] because salt fat sugar or [[hypernormal stimuli]] on in the augustatory system right we have to apply that to the sensory system that's coming in through things like [[social media]] and that means less [[social media]] less entertainment more study and it doesn't have as fast a [[reward circuit]] it just doesn't but it has a much better longer term [[reward circuit]] where your baseline goes up and this is where enough mindfulness and enough discipline have to come in because otherwise the orientation of the system is that it's more profitable for corporations for me to be addicted because you maximize lifetime value of a [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=410.479s)

customer through addiction and it's an asymmetric war because they're a billionaire trillion dollar company and i'm me so how do i win in that asymmetric war where it's in their profit incentive whether it's mcdonald's or facebook or fox for me to be maximally addicted i have to recognize holy  __  right like [428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=428.639s)

i actually have no sovereignty even if i claim to live in a democracy against hypocrisies who want to control and manipulate my behavior in a way that is net negative for me holistically while having the [[plausible deniability]] that i'm choosing it because they're coercing my choice so i have to get afraid of that enough that i mount a rebellion right a [448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=448.56s)

revolutionary war in myself against those who want to drive my hypernormal stimulus [[reward circuit]] so the whole how can everybody become more immune to the shitty [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] and notice them and become immune to them and how can they become more oriented to the healthy [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] that's another way of talking about what we [467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=467.039s)

have to do writ large yeah that's beautiful uh completely agree um in fact it dovetails with another thought that first time i thought it i thought it was original and then having said it i discovered lots and lots of people had said it before me that there's a very close relationship between wisdom and delayed gratification that it's the ability to bypass the short-term [[reward circuit]] in order to get to something deeper and better that is you know that is what wisdom is about but you didn't include on your list what i consider to be maybe the one of the most important [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=508.56s)

instances of the failure that you're talking about which is sex there's a very direct comparison at least for either males who are wired in a normal fashion for a straight guy or women who are toying with that same programming which i believe there are many but the comparison between casual sex which is certainly uh we are as males wired to find that a very appealing notion because it's such a bargain if you can produce a baby where you're not expected to contribute to its raising that's a that's a huge evolutionary win and then you have to compare that to the rewards of a deep romantic lasting relationship with commitment and the problem is that the deep lasting relationship stuff has a hard time winning out over the instant gratification thing if the instant gratification thing is at all common and so that's really screwing up people's circuitry with respect to interpersonal [580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=580.08s)

relationships and bonding and i have a sense that it is also in a way that's much harder to demonstrate contributing to the derangement of civilization that people many fewer people have a relationship you know it's not like uh marriage is easy right it's not it's super complex but having somebody who you can fully [600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=600.56s)

trust somebody who you've effectively you know fused your identity with to the level that they share your interests and uh you know they may be the only person who'll tell you what you need to know at some points and the fact that many people are missing that i think is deeply unhealthy [618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=618.0s)

yeah so i would say that market type dynamics benefit from exploiting the shitty [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] across every evolved [[reward circuit]] axis and so from an evolutionary point of view survive and mate are the things that make your genes get through primarily so we mentioned the survive the calorie one early earlier [646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=646.959s)

right so in an [[evolutionary environment]] i could get plenty of green leafy things in many environments um it was very hard to get enough fat enough sugar and enough salt those were evolutionarily rare things so more dopaminergic hits on those so fast food ended up figuring out how to [666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=666.64s)

just combine fat salt sugar with no other nutrients with maximized uh ease of palatability and textures and there's like a scientific optimization of all of the dopamine hit with none of the nutrients so you can actually be obese and dying of starvation right and what that is to nutrition [684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=684.079s)

where you would should have a natural dopaminergic hit on something that has nutrients built in for you know adaptive purposes is what porn and online dating is to intimate relationship is what facebook and instagram is to tribal bonding is how do we take the [[hypernormal stimuli]] part of it out separate it from the [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=709.519s)

nutrients and make a maximally fast addictive hit that actually has none of what requires energetic process yeah i've called this the junkification of everything and it is directly an allusion to junk food where we can most easily see this but the idea is you will be given [730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=730.24s)

a distilled so if i can rephrase what you said in terms that are more native to me when you are wired to seek you know the umami taste that tends to be very tightly correlated with meat you will tend to get a lot of nutrients along with it in in the ancestral context in the [755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=755.839s)

modern context we can figure out how to just trip the circuit that tells you to be rewarded and it's no longer a proxy for the things that it was supposed to lead you to and as you just said you can now look at that across every domain where you have these dopamine rewards [772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=772.32s)

and understand why people are you know living in the world that uh pinker correctly identifies we are living in where we have just a huge abundance um and yet are so darn unhealthy certainly unsatisfied right it explains that that paradox of being better off in many ways than any [792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snD5FZCVII&t=792.079s)

ancestor could have hoped to be and yet being uh effectively ill across every domain
