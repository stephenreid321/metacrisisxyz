so daniel thank you so much for coming tom as always great to see you daniel you and i have been friends for a while i've learned a lot from you thanks for spending some time with us here at a time when many of us in the world were learning how to ride a bike you were studying [[complex system|complex systems]] you were studying engineering self-awareness cognitive science philosophy [36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=36.559s)

you are an extraordinary autodidact when i was introduced to you the person introduced us said you were one of the brightest people in the world i kind of wondered in the time i've spent with you i've realized that's probably certainly true if not an understatement you've done meaningful work on [[catastrophic risk]] scenarios and avoidance that's really where we began [54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=54.96s)

to get to know each other when i was working on warnings you continue to focus in a world spun out of control in the systems solutions needed to heal it you call it long-term civilization design i think you advise big bold name technical leaders and technologists and scientists you're a hero of people in the world [73](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=73.68s)

trying to make sense of an increasingly nonsensical and creative increasingly dangerous globe you're launching an initiative called the consilience project which i'm honored to be a small part of and i hope we can talk about that a bit today you spoke at the flashpoints forum conference last year you and i jammed a lot of your wisdom into a very short lunch session that's the worst time of the day to speak i still thank you for doing that and i noticed in that talk at the at the flash points forum um conversation when you were speaking at lunch in the front row was a prime minister with whom i've [109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=109.28s)

worked for years he's a very serious man some people think of him as a very difficult man he's clearly a technical genius and i've never seen him so entrenched i've never seen him so fascinated i've never seen him so amazed and i've never seen his face slightly puzzled and i saw all those things on his face when you were speaking at our [127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=127.119s)

conference last year that's often how i feel when we get the chance to talk i hope to bring some of that wisdom to our listeners today many of whom will meet you for the first time through this show i also hope that we can get into a conversation about your complex thoughts on how to fix our big minds in our world and then [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=143.84s)

i'd love to be able to get you and tom to spend some time comparing and contrasting his deep thinking his big successes trying to heal our hearts i think it's going to be a powerful conversation between the two of you as well i'm going to be up all night because i know those conversations is going to fire me up [162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=162.8s)

i also having to be prepared at 6 pm had a cup of coffee or i'm drinking a cup of coffee right now at six or else i would be tremendously outgoing to only be slightly outgoing with a cup of coffee i hope so here's to this daniel thanks so much for being with us um and it's an honor yeah glad to be happy to be here over ridiculously over generous introduction but there's a lot of things i'm very curious about that i've been trying to sense make and i'm looking forward to the conversation today let me ask you about the elf in the room it's more than the elf in the room it's the thing on everyone's mind it's the front of every newspaper and every news feed which is the coming election for president united states you spend a lot of time thinking about existential and [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] something what is it 35 percent of the voters right now believe this election maybe a quarter is existential they're extraordinarily concerned about the outcome here there's a lot of other people who are very concerned i mean you know there's almost no one who isn't quite concerned about where this election is going just broadly i wonder if you had any introductory thoughts about does this election matter that much what does this election um mean and what kind of things are you [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=231.28s)

looking for as election unfolds and the new president sits uh in relation to your concerns about sort of long-term civilization survival yeah i'll say i have more questions about it than um very solid predictions but a few things in terms how i'm looking at it what are you looking for what's [249](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=249.92s)

interesting to you what do you think the outcomes what do you think what are the stakes i think this election is unique in um modern history of having two things both be the case that a huge amount of the population on both sides anticipates the election being stolen or [268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=268.68s)

rigged or somehow unfairly judged to have questions around the election integrity so that no matter who ends up being considered to win it will be considered an illegitimate win by a huge percentage of the population and that combined with a huge percentage of the population on both sides thinking it's existential so the uh trump camp having many people that think if that trump is the only thing that stands between some kind of globalist set of agendas and the debasing of national integrity of the us completely and the anti-trump camp that holds that trump getting in will be the end of the republic because he'll [312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=312.96s)

uh create a dynasty and like formerly the end of the republic so what do we do in a situation where the chance of the election being contested because of mail-in ballots and all kinds of things is very high the supreme court the electoral college the senate whoever might come in to try and adjudicate that is [334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=334.0s)

also not really understood or trusted by citizens widely all of the journalistic incentive is for inflammation and we end up getting a situation where the government is considered illegitimate with an illegitimate president in an existentially consequential way to coming up on half of the citizenry no [359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=359.039s)

matter which way it goes i think this is a huge issue and i think you know rp our psu and ergo we're looking at being able to predict social violence uh as it arose with the riots coming out of the protests but from covid we didn't know what would spark it we knew there were like a handful of things but we knew that when unemployment goes [379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=379.28s)

up that much the social violence possibility goes up pretty heavily well we still have very high unemployment we have high evictions we have increasing embodied polarization around racial issues around left-right issues around mask no mask covet reality issues and so now we're looking at this on top [399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=399.199s)

of all of that and the actual kind of like insurgency and militia on both far right and far left preparation um so i i think we're moving i think the election is going to be really problematic and i would say for or it very easily can be [422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=422.24s)

i would say if there's a period of time where it is contested and the u.s doesn't have a clear executive branch um what the rest of the world does probably not towards the us directly but as far as power grabs internationally for the for geopolitical influence is also a very very big question not just what happened socially domestically [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=447.759s)

one of the pieces of history i would say is for people that don't have a good thinking of history democracies don't live very long historically they typically die in less than 300 years we're at about 250 years on this one no civilization or empire is enduring forever they all end up falling and there are certain characteristics that [471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=471.68s)

when we look at the fall of previous empires and previous democracies that we can kind of find that generally play out and we see those types of things playing out pretty well here so for me and we already don't have something that's really like a republic we don't have a government of for and by the people that are [490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=490.08s)

comprehensively educated are have a uh unbiased [[fourth estate]] where they know what's going on and they're actively engaged in the functions of the state we have a permanent political class with a rotating door between the market that it's supposed to regulate and the regulators that end up getting captured by it and [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=508.8s)

basically narrative and info warfare having replaced news and [[public education]] having been eroded and so the question for me is and then you also see that like when you have term limits and we understand why we have term limits it's very hard to do long-term planning for anyone who has an incentive to have things that will pay [531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=531.12s)

off within the time of their term limit when you have massive left-right polarization because of a two-party system you end up having so much of the energy go into the coordination cost of just getting elected and trying to keep what everything you did going that the ability to coordinate well as a nation is very low [547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=547.6s)

so then you see over the last 20 years china's ability with something more like an emperor ship to build high-speed rail all around the world and infrastructure all around the world when we still can't fix roads and between that and turkey and venezuela and brazil and movements in india we can see a more autocratic direction [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=569.12s)

globally as one of the trends and we can also see why is because the idea of a democratic a [[participatory governance]] where lots of people who see the world differently all work together is actually a ridiculous proposition like it's a really hard thing to make that work well and i would say that there is a level of [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=587.2s)

civilization fabric social fabric that underlies that even being possible which is you know george washington saying the number one aim of government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government and i think it was franklin who said if i could have perfect government broken news or [610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=610.32s)

perfect news and broken government i think the perfect news because if the people really know what's going on they can remake government if they don't know what's going on they can't possibly make good decisions and if we think of a republic or a democracy as a participatory choice making process for consequential choices that are kind of shared across us [626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=626.88s)

we have to have participatory sense-making and high-quality communication to be able to coordinate and enough like political understanding to know that politics is how you sublimate warfare like how you make compromises with people that think really differently than you and value different things [642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=642.0s)

where a compromise is better than warfare so you actually can't just ignore and villainize them you actually have to listen to and work with them uh so these are a few thoughts related to the position the u.s is in and so what i see is that we are at a place where the u.s has decayed to a level where either it [661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=661.36s)

just has decreasing relevance in the world moving forward or it needs a reboot and the reboot of a real kind of republic has to be bottom-up it has to actually be citizenry that are getting comprehensively educated about how to make sense of the world rather than just get captured by [680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=680.16s)

some tribalistic [[narrative warfare]] kind of narrative that have to get much more media literate and they have to get have to start to have a value around good faith understanding not just pejorative straw manning of the people that hold the other view to be able to say how can we work together because those other people [700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=700.0s)

don't stop existing just because i stopped listening so the prime minister's face is now getting puzzled so i want to i want to break this into a small building blocks for everybody today um first i'm reminded of a quote uh well not a quote hr mcmaster and i know you familiar with him and you've seen [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=716.16s)

our interview with him makes the point in our interview in his book that the deterrence effect of an educated populist is extraordinary and necessary and we don't have that um i just wanted to touch on that quick thing but previously back in the election a lot of people think it's existential a lot of people think it's rigged it's [732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=732.32s)

very likely to be contested probably over you know over 30 percent likely which is a humongous number that it's going to be dramatically contested you put that on top of massive distrust in our government to start with 65 percent of people believe the economy is rigged and they're probably right based on where they're sitting and you [749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=749.44s)

talk a lot about [[narrative warfare]] replacing news so let's start with that for a second we had tristan harris on here who's saying his praises about you and all the work you did with the social dilemma which i i wasn't surprised after having watched the movie that you know you had a lot of your fingerprints on it [766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=766.959s)

let's talk about [[narrative warfare]] what's it mean that [[narrative warfare]] is replacing news i'd say there's cycles of this throughout history um you can read sun tzu and hear about narrative and info warfare thousands of years ago right how to control what people believe is true and what they think both as a [788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=788.0s)

political and military strategies as old as civilization um as far as in the current environment a few things that i would say are particularly key and you probably covered this with tristan well the movement from broadcast news to largely decentralized [[social media]] based uh uptake of the media environment is [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=812.88s)

one of the most significant factors in the contemporary environment because our governmental institutions were built in the era of and around broadcast capability from the [[printing press]] which was broadcast through the telegraph through the radio through the tv was basically one-to-many type broadcast with very few people [831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=831.12s)

having access to the mechanisms of broadcast and everyone else receiving relatively unified messages so of course they could be distorted right of course you could have some moguls having more political or economic influence affecting the news so we're not saying it was at all perfect but at least as [848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=848.0s)

far as social coherence goes everyone was seeing something relatively similar when there was three new stations when you have a and to the degree that it's wrong there's at least some accountability um and there's not as much just complete overwhelm and the overwhelm drives a kind of epistemic nihilism [869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=869.6s)

where people don't really even think they can really make sense of it and then they're more just oriented to pick sides and defect towards strongman leaders let's not skip over that that's a fascinating idea i haven't heard you mentioned before because there's so much news coming at us so fast people get overwhelmed and [887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=887.68s)

feel like they can't keep up though in fact they're just looking at you know a huge different uh many different facets of similar news or fake news in and that becomes overwhelming to them and they feel sort of left behind yeah a flooding problem you'll see interviews or polls where russians are asked if [906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=906.88s)

they think putin lies to them in the news publicly and it's you know extremely high 70 90 say yes but then they also he has that high of an approval rating and in a situation where they felt um their country was kind of drained after the wall by the way capitalism came in nato's attacks on them whatever it [927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=927.92s)

was like having a strong man leader including having to lie just is existentially safer and i think in situations like current environments people's ability to really make sense of [[climate change]] how long do we have how serious is it going to be is like are we all just does my 401k [948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=948.56s)

even matter are we all about to be completely screwed and it seems like there are scientists who disagree on this and is china really close to some kind of world domination plan or not it seems like there's very kind of uh different views on that and hydroxychloroquine masks covid whatever right like disagreement on [[base reality]] across so many things and the ability to say well let me look at all the signs that really try to make sense that people don't have the time or the skill and so there isn't just a place where they start to resonate with both leaders and subgroups that are more like them and so [988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=988.48s)

epistemology gets replaced by tribalism so it's similar to when under stress we revert to type you're saying when under an overwhelming amount of information we still revert to type overwhelming amount of information and dissonance of information and this is where fud becomes a strategy right so fear uncertainty and doubt on [1006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1006.48s)

purpose because then since people can't make sense of it then rhetoric works better and then have the strong rhetoric and and people don't want to be outgrouped and they do want to be part of an in-group whose rhetoric appeals to the aesthetics of that in-group you'll notice that the way that the demo left-leaning pop [1025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1025.12s)

a left-leaning politician will kind of stir up the crowd doesn't appeal to people on the right like as an aesthetic they're like i don't care if you call me a racist right now and i'm not like solve [[climate change]] doesn't move me and whatever and similarly the way that someone on the right talking [1045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1045.28s)

that about [[national security]] or protecting our borders or whatever doesn't appeal to the people on the left so there's and it's it's a belief system but it's all the way down to almost like a cultural aesthetic that the rhetoric can move people who share a cultural aesthetic beyond the actual epistemology beyond them saying [1063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1063.039s)

well what are the actual [[national security]] risks what is my basis for knowing and how clear am i on that or what are the actual you know border issues or [[climate change]] issues so yes i would say epistemology being replaced by tribalism is one of the really huge issues and so then now we [1080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1080.0s)

were talking about the movement to decentralize media so let me let me stop you and i'm going to do this a little bit so we can we can keep people uh from losing you so flooding becomes a strategy i think that's a fantastic insight there's no longer a shared reality there's no longer a modern day walter cronkite [[social media]] others are limitlessly hijacking us they know precisely how to do it our monkey brains throughout the entire process are being driven back to tribalism is there a threshold beyond which it's impossible to reel the public back into a shared reality is there a point where people are so disillusioned and warped by [1119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1119.12s)

misinformation disinformation that they can no longer be reached by even our best efforts and and if so are we getting to a point where too many people in this country are are thereby lost if we keep the things that are conditioning people and increasingly polarized directions in place yes we get to a place where interventions would be very hard but like no matter how riled up somebody is on on the left or the right about whatever like ready to take to the street with guns about it all they have to do is just scroll instagram for a while folk [1161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1161.6s)

where political stuff isn't occurring but um just social pictures are and engage in entertainment a little bit and they'll mostly forget about it because there's such a flood of other kinds of stimuli the reason why they don't forget about is because that media [1180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1180.0s)

stimuli is continuing to come through the instagram and the facebook feed and whatever it is um pretty often if we could change the media environment because i think basically it's there's a it's not just that it was in cultured and now it's the case especially given how little time most people spend an embodied space with each [1201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1201.039s)

other and how much social interaction has become virtualized through a screen and how much of it is then the artifact of this of the [[social media]] platforms um so do i think that if we were able to change the kind of media environment that people were in that we could actually change and change what people were [1226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1226.72s)

taking into their minds that we could change it relatively reasonably yes i do now how to do that's quite a hard problem i don't remember the word you used rp but when you think about sort of this the [[social media]] limbic thing is because they got good at figuring out how to draw your attention right but [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1246.559s)

there's another part of that where it's almost like the marketplace of algorithms that's just gonna do what it's gonna do right and i know they can control it to a certain point but basically they're they're going to distract they're going to they're going to make that limbic stuff get all limbicky right [1265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1265.36s)

because that's what they're learning how to do right and what it with whatever method they may use and so okay so that's just one side of the equation all i'm trying to say there is like it's almost like a benign evil that's going on over there to a certain extent and you know there's all kinds of you know incentive-based reasons why [1284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1284.64s)

they may not want to fix any of those things but then i even wonder to what extent they even could but let's put that aside for one second on the other side of the equation and i think we're all gonna marvel at this one day some of us already do this guy trump is outrageous like this guy's the biggest media star in the [1304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1304.88s)

history of the planet bar none i mean that guy's name has showed up in more places in more parts of this world more times than any human ever right it's just outrageous what a big kind of media star this is so what what he has is a certain kind of charisma whatever you want to call it you use a different word i don't really care [1322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1322.96s)

i don't want anyone to think it's a compliment or not all i'm trying to say is like this guy puts on a show like nobody we've ever seen and if you think of the last two presidents we've had we went from a big time rock star superstar which was barack obama and that's when we were kind of moving out of the old days [1337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1337.6s)

and we came into whatever you call this guy the biggest circus performer in the history of the world i don't know and you just imagine like imagine if trump was like a little more reagan-esque now i know those two things may not go together all i'm trying to say is if he if he'd sought a more broad appeal of a certain kind like god [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1355.039s)

imagine what he might do now he may not have the capability of doing that kind of a thing anyway i'm getting verbose here but the thing i wonder is in the end might our best hope be charisma tied to reason like i just don't know what other things what other person what other group other than maybe that [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1377.039s)

because let's one other thing i want to say before i stop if you think about what joe biden is i mean you're talking about an old white guy like really old like will be the oldest president of all time who is anyone really voting for joe biden i mean really when it comes right down [1394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1394.72s)

to it i understand lots and lots and lots of people are voting against donald trump i get it they're voting for a certain democratic platform but in the end like wow are we at an interesting time and at a minimum like just put yourself in let's say biden wins and now it's august of 2021. [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1410.799s)

what's going on is he really the charismatic leader that's changing this world is that really what's going to happen or is it just going to be noise city just all kinds of new kinds of noises that are coming from all these other weird places based on this new reality that maybe biden for the first time will teach us [1428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1428.24s)

just how wild it is because this sort of calm older guy sitting at the middle of it and it's still not orderly that's what i fear anyway i just said a lot yeah so when i kind of hear you saying is um that the charisma of a person speaking is its own limbic hijack in addition whatever it is that the [1450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1450.72s)

algorithms do and then you have an interplay between those right between you have the limbic hijack of what goes out on the media and then you have the limbic hijack of which of that is specially selected on my news feed based on my interaction with it and obviously the news feed can't olympically hijack me if it doesn't have [1468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1468.0s)

content to put in there that has that effect right so you end up getting this reinforcement dynamic and you mentioned a benign evil so i'm gonna just address the [[social media]] thing for a minute and then come back to the uh the president charisma thing yes the [[social media]] algorithms whether we're talking about youtube's recommended video algorithm or facebook's newsfeed algorithm when they drive political polarization or ideologic infringement it's not their intention like there there is nobody there saying we want to make you know antipa whatever um but in so far as they have to pick [1507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1507.039s)

metrics to optimize and the thing is just as powerful as it is yeah and time on site is a good metric to optimize for and because of lots of reasons the advertising model is going to be relevant to how much time on site and how many people are coming but even beyond just the pay and the advertising model it's their way of sensing how much are people liking this [1530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1530.4s)

thing right uh people's life is not that good spending that much time on facebook or youtube their life would be better to get off and to the degree that they're clear right that they're in their kind of executive function prefrontal cortex they would check in quickly say i want to spend 15 minutes and then go about [1548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1548.88s)

doing other things but it once they've been scrolling for two hours that happened because they weren't in their executive function right it happened because either their fear of missing out or their desire for social cues because there's lonely and there's lots of faces on there and largely photoshopped faces or because of their political outrage [1565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1565.679s)

whatever it is but it's appealing to the things that would actually have someone spend a lot of time that is not really well used time for them and so that drives addiction because that's olympic hijack right but it also drives things that scare me and things that anger me [1583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1583.039s)

and um because if i see things that really scare me i'm not going to leave i'm going to feel like i need to know this but then if there's a billion pieces of news on a topic and there's no way i could ever take them all in what the youtube algorithm recommends for me or what the facebook feed curates for me is the ones that based on my previous interactions the ones that i shared and clicked on whatever are most likely to have me share and click on them so that means that it appeals to bias and it appeals to emotionality so when you have a population where everyone's bias and emotionality is getting double down on then you get increasing in-group [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1620.799s)

tribalism and increasing out-group antipathy right and it's very strong and people don't know it's happening because let's say that i'm going down the youtube recommended videos or i'm going down the news feed i can scroll down the newsfeed forever and keep getting more of the same type of stuff so it seems like that's the whole [1641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1641.84s)

world and of course because what's going to appeal to me there regarding talking about the other side is going to be versions of the other side to get me fired up i'm going to keep getting pejorative straw man versions of the other side and reinforcing versions of my side which means that good faith endeavor to [1660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1660.08s)

seek to understand is being broken right now because that's what's being selected for on the facebook algorithm and that's where people are spending time on site then the news agencies themselves have more incentive to make more salacious headlines and shorter things that appeal to shorter attention spans and which means that they can't possibly have complex or nuanced views because a complex nuanced view someone doesn't have an attention span for yeah you can't run good [[sensemaking]] which also means you can't run democracy with short attention spans you just can't right it requires a larger bit size to be able to understand something well [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1698.32s)

enough to know what a good choice is and so the addiction of new stimuli new stimuli i've been reading for five whole seconds and i haven't got a new stimuli that leads to the shortened attention span is itself fundamentally breaking down the possibility of [[participatory governance]] and so you get this feedback cycle right between what the algorithms that are the [1719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1719.76s)

digital environment which we're consuming information about the world and the producers of the content what their incentive is that will actually get paid attention to and in the conditioning of the population and so we could intervene on any of those three areas oh and then also the incentive of the [1738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1738.0s)

politicians right so if a politician does more salacious stuff that is automatically easier for the news to pick up that's also going to be useful and so what we see is a set of reinforcement dynamics so then you're asking could we make a politician who is charismatic enough but where the charisma is bound to good [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1755.6s)

thinking we could ask could we make news that tries to bind effective limbic hijacks to good thinking you can ask could we change the [[social media]] algorithms in such a way that are still sticky but walking people in the right direction and then at the end of it you could say could we educate the populace [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1773.36s)

to be more aware of how much the world is seeking to hijack their attention and that there is feel good about any of those i feel good about a strategy that's working on all of them simultaneously and i feel particularly good about the last one that i'm mentioning right now would it would it would it not be perhaps easier [1797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1797.2s)

if it was a malignant thing like might we be able to solve the problem more directly if it were more malignant that's the thing that scares me is that the technium actually is take playing a role here that that's just frightening to a certain extent i mean i want to believe don't don't get me wrong like i i have a predisposition towards optimism [1816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1816.799s)

but i don't know like even the first one like we're talk because we're because we're talking about a certain kind of charisma which and i'll give you an example so today i watched chris hayes and and uh what's her name uh rachel maddow just laughing so hard about the jeffrey toobin thing [1836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1836.64s)

and like doing this kind of bow thing together with each other on the news and i looked at it and i'm immature so i'm not judging them as humans but i am judging our news like they were having more fun with jeffrey tubin and masturbation than just about anything they could have had in a long time and i looked at him like this is like the world we live in right now like there's no way cronkite was doing that and there's something to that that by the way from a business perspective apparently doesn't work very well because if it did there'd be people doing it but from a cultural perspective it scares the hell out of me when you say would it be easier if it [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1868.24s)

was more malignant the thing the the deepest underlying things that are driving the problems in the world are not a clear bad guy it's not nazis um people want to focus on uh a clear bad guy and so they actually over norm things to that but why political left-right polarization has moved in the direction [1897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1897.36s)

it has or why a facebook why tick-tock became more sticky than facebook did because of an incentive war that even if you change one platform there's other platforms emerging um the the underlying dynamics are the are are kind of like an invisible hand themselves and they're a bunch of hyper objects hyper objects is an important concept which is we evolved to perceive things with our senses and to be able to look at hear touch taste and ground to understand something to know how to respond to it because in our [[evolutionary environment]] we were mostly responding to things like that were either direct threats or direct opportunities that our [1946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1946.559s)

senses could work with it's impossible to directly sense [[climate change]] it's not something that you can sense i i can see snow melting somewhere but i could always see snow melting i have to try to take statistics on snow melt year over year and ice caps and things about co2 that i can't see that are [1966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=1966.0s)

invisible in the atmosphere so i can conceptualize it but i can't sense it to have it feel viscerally real to me i can't sense the [[social media]] algorithms i can't sense the the principles of [[narrative warfare]] or class dynamics or um any of those types of things i can't sense [[arms race|arms races]] i can see there's a drone but i can't see all of the drones and the [[arms race|arms races]] towards ai weapons that conceptualize it but it's very hard for us to conceptualize a hyper object emotionally as well as it is a real object particularly an agent because the bad guy historically mostly looked like an agent that wanted to come attack us right [2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2008.32s)

and so oh it's nazis it's terrorists it's republicans it's democrats it's you know whoever it is the bad guy is great we're pretty good at that when we have problems that are hyper objects that are the result of collective behavioral dispositions right [[climate change]] is not the result of nazis or communists or or republicans or democrats right it's [2030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2030.48s)

the result of collective behavioral dispositions it's very hard to make that the bad guy in a clear enough way that will motivate different tribes that are against each other unifying against and so the kind of enemy hypothesis where people will orient to be more tribal and they'll only unify if they have a [2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2048.24s)

shared enemy it's very hard to make the hyper objects that really are the shared enemy of everyone the felt shared enemy because evolutionary we're not that wired that way so it's much easier to keep making each other enemies but when you keep making each other enemies where you have increasing narrative [2063](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2063.919s)

weapons right the ability to put fake or at least spawn or conspiratorial or whatever it is info out and spread it to billions of people and make it highly viral and split test what makes it most viral when you have when you have also then decentralized real weapons that are more [2083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2083.119s)

catastrophic cyber weapons drone weapons whatever what happens when you keep running conflict energy from of humans towards other humans with increasingly decentralized increasingly catastrophic capability it go it goes badly right so we do have to figure out how to deal with that thing let's get to that one second let me daniel let me try to i was thinking this morning about can we channel the nationalist zeal that america has against china it is something that's actually great for the growth of america like could we look at how china does long-range planning and look at how they put [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2118.96s)

their best and brightest into some of those long-range plans obviously they have all sorts of other advantages we don't have so far as former government and use that as a way to redesign aspects of america i asked that because i'm i'm asked that in reflection of what you guys are just describing about hyper objects if can we use things like that can we [2137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2137.2s)

use things that stir us up as a people to motivate us to incentivize us towards positive directions overall can we find thing so punchline being how do we incentivize people to pay attention to things that can't be sensed directly yeah so you have a couple different answers [2160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2160.64s)

the the only enduring and effective answer that i know is much deeper and wider education so that more people understand the hyper objects well enough and can actually make choices from executive function that they're not just needing an enemy hypothesis that they viscerally feel outside of that any solution i can give [2186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2186.079s)

where i'm saying okay here's how i manipulate the populists that don't understand stuff there will always be a that's a that drives [[arms race|arms races]] whenever i'm doing war you always get armed races you never get to create a weapon and not have a counter weapon from some group that wants something else where they learn what was effective [2203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2203.04s)

about your weapon iterate on it so it's kind of like and i think this is something that i've seen the political left recently in the u.s be particularly not cognizant of so if you use shame as a social tool call people racists and islamophobics and transphobics and whatever to kind of like shame them into a particular kind of political view or political correctness that shame as a weapon as a narrative weapon creates a counter weapon and the counter weapon is not giving a  __  about those titles at all that's one of the counter weapons right so at a certain point it's like oh that [2243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2243.04s)

just stops working call me a race as  __  off and um another one of the counter weapons is if okay let's let's have to the degree that academia and left establishment started to have some alignments more than we can say was fully unbiasedly warranted and so there was a [2266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2266.4s)

uh people on the political right feeling like there were academic arguments they couldn't argue it didn't feel true to them or that didn't feel like it took their concerns to mind well so this would be things like social sciences critical race theory whatever it is or some of the environmental sciences [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2289.599s)

that didn't that address and even whether they're wrong or whether they're just partial but all didn't also partially address the things that other people had lived experience of anti-intellectualism becomes a counter weapon to weaponize academia where they're like i trust my gut and i'm i'm sticking with [2307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2307.68s)

the bible or i trust my gut and i'm sticking with trump or whatever it is um so it's always important to think about if we're not talking about really educating people where they can think well about what's true and we're talking about well okay they're they're too dumb to do that so how do we effectively use some kind of narrative control mechanisms on them [2326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2326.32s)

other groups will also be doing that to the degree that that's effective and then you have to deal with the escalation the [[arms race]] of [[narrative warfare]] with exponentiating [[narrative warfare]] technology now start to see what happens when they're putting on the vr headsets and being in these environments and on and on so we've done a pretty good job probably describing some of the challenge set in which we find ourselves in this civilization in this brain inside this media environment and when i jumped in before that last question you were beginning to talk about some of the modern day risks or consequences so i'm i'm trying to show a a chapter [2359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2359.359s)

separation here for our listeners of you know what i think we would have learned about before is part of how hard it is to come to solutions being who we are and where we are but i'd love to hear a little more from you about why it matters that we deal with solutions well now and one quote that i heard you say i [2376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2376.32s)

thought was was quite illuminating was we're running through a forest increasingly fast and increasingly blind right so what are these trees we may run into what are the risks what are the higher consequence challenges that are in front of us right now that we may not be aware of i don't i don't know that it's terribly useful for most people to study existential and [[catastrophic risk]] well if they don't feel like they have some agency connected to being able to make things better because it just can stress them out and sometimes even make them nihilistic where they don't engage the agency they could have and i i'm going to interrupt you and i did i tell you the story about and there he's walked in about my 11 year old then nine year old when i was writing warnings and the chapter on on the the control function [[artificial intelligence]] and one of his the parents of one of his friends called me up and was like what are you teaching your kids at home [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2430.96s)

because you've terrified one of my children so i agree we evolution selected for all animals including us for sensory mechanisms information processing to process that sense information and then actuator output to act on it in a closed loop right um if i could sense something but [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2451.04s)

i couldn't make sense of it there'd be no evolutionary adaptive value to that and it wouldn't have been selected for if i could make sense of it but i couldn't act on it or if i could act in a way that wasn't informed by sensing the environment none of those would be adaptive so what's selected for is the closed loop between those technologies kind of broken that loop open for humans where i can sense things that i'm not directly sensing through the internet news i can hear what's happening in dc or portland or bangladesh or whatever but i can't actually make sense of is that true is it the whole truth what's going on because i'm getting very [2485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2485.599s)

partial sensing and on things too complex so my i can send stuff but not make sense of it to the degree i feel like i can make sense of something large-scale things like [[climate change]] or whatever i don't feel like i can act on it because i don't have the agency like what do i do about that [2500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2500.64s)

and to the degree that i can that i am acting on things i'm acting through largely decentralized distributed process i'm buying something that had [[supply chain|supply chains]] that took six continents and all kinds of activity to make the thing happen so i'm having effect right my action is actually [2516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2516.64s)

through [[supply chain|supply chains]] having a globalized effect but i can't sense it so i can't really make appropriate choices and as a res as a result the the binding of [[sensemaking]] an agency is very broken and i want to rebind those because if someone is hearing about problems that they feel [2537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2537.04s)

like they can't do anything about oftentimes there's just overwhelm and shut down let's go to entertainment or whatever it is or sometimes even worse is something like nihilism sets in and so i can talk about what are some of the [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] but the context i'm trying to set first is [2555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2555.52s)

i think for most people them being more aware of their local news what's really going on and how they can help out with the animal shelter the pta the integrity of local governments the things where they feel like they actually have some agency to do it they should invest more of their [[sensemaking]] in places where they can do something about it because they'll actually then do positive things and they will increase their sense of agency which will then allow them to start sensing larger things and being able to take steps well i i sign up to that um but at the same time you and others and i to maybe some extent [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2591.52s)

have to make sure we are really looking at these [[existential risk|existential risks]] as well and i think that's probably a pretty wise direction for this conversation where you're going where we find ourselves with this challenge of incentivizing accurate information disincentivizing false information i'm using your words to make a request i would like you guys [2609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2609.76s)

just quickly just name five i mean i'm sitting here like i wonder what the  __  these guys think is existential because i got my list so i'm guessing your list is better than mine and there and others so just give us five something to think about don't want to take too much right daniel you start with number one [2626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2626.24s)

so some people categorize it by like uh ex [[exponential tech|exponential technologies]] who's you can't do you're doing two you have to do one i don't have a taxonomy that i would wait that way and so i was going to do a meta comment on it maybe you want to share your top five and then i will make some comments on that i don't know my top five i would say i mean we kind of [2648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2648.319s)

covered it pretty well but i would probably start with the control function on super intelligence um i would then probably talk about and of course this gets to your concept about about self-recursive technologies i would then get to um crispr cast 9 and gene editing and then i would probably get [2667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2667.76s)

to and then obviously the use for that in biological weapons um i think there's i mean i think there's a societal disruption probably coming from sudden global sudden global sea level rise i don't think i put it as high up at my list and i feel like i'm kind of missing [2687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2687.359s)

something that we were talking about earlier which is about just the dissolution of society it's not existential but so the dissolution of society the end of fox americana the end of the ability for america to offer any sort of goodness to global world order that the taking over that mantle by [2705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2705.92s)

a country that has shown great disregard for human rights which is china i don't find that's obviously not existential but i think that's a category risk so i don't know there's my quick shot so so what's not on your list is war not for existential so yeah that's cool but by the way tom i think that's a good one too by the way it's a [2723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2723.599s)

good one too i think that i think the the risk of um global nuclear winner from even a much smaller nuclear exchange than the one that we thought about in the cold war like a north korea u.s exchange or an india pakistan exchange as described by dr alan robach is a very serious risk as well and that's a gig of death risk not an [[existential risk]] meaning millions and billions of people would die but perhaps not the end of civilization cheery so yeah if we define existential as the uh end of all sapiens and there's even worse forms of the end of all mammals or all hydrocarbon life on earth or something like that um there are not that many scenarios that take us there uh and but if we talk about [[catastrophic risk]] of losing the improvements of quality of life that have been happening and losing a huge amount of the collective knowledge and wisdom and industrial capacity and like that as well as a tremendous [2781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2781.76s)

amount of life there's quite a lot more scenarios where that happens um and i know rp you've had uh nick bostrom uh come speak in group before everybody should study boston's work if they want to have a good insight into [[existential risk]] reading yuval harare's second book yep global [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] uh is a good slightly easier intro to the topic so i'll talk about catastrophic non-[[existential risk]] that i'm particularly more concerned by is something that involves cascades between a bunch of different categories where none of them on their own if you're just modeling if i'm just modeling nuclear risk or [2827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2827.76s)

just modeling [[climate change]] or just poverty by itself i don't get this but if i start to look at [[climate change]] not as something that makes a venusified uninhabitable planet but something that makes increasing droughts that destroy crops and going along with decreasing groundwater start to create massive unlivable areas [2848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2848.48s)

in india and bangladesh and various places like that that lead to human migration and very large scale human migration that then leads to resource pressures and resource wars that then lead to war escalation on existing political fault lines that can then lead to increasing participation on multiple [2870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2870.96s)

sides of that and more scaled war that can lead to breakdowns of [[critical infrastructure]] and [[supply chain|supply chains]] government structures so you know i think that um you know like with with kovit kovid was just a big enough catastrophe to start setting off a bunch of the systemic fragilities um uh i'll just i'll share one way of [2894](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2894.72s)

thinking about this the idea of human induced real [[catastrophic risk]] wasn't even a reasonable idea until world war ii in the bomb because we didn't have technology big enough to mess everything up we just weren't that powerful and then and so the major empires always ward throughout all of history like we [2915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2915.839s)

don't have any real knowledge of how to be at peace with each other um historically for very long periods of time only for relatively short periods and so now all of a sudden with the nuclear bomb and the consequence of it the major empires aren't allowed to war with each other anymore and so we got this [[bretton woods]] globe globalization world that said okay let's be so economically interdependent on each other that it is and focus on massive gdp growth for the whole world that everyone gets to be part of a positive sun game and we don't need to kill each other over who gets the scarce resource because it's not zero sum because we're growing total gdp through globalization [2951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2951.2s)

extraction so fast and we're so dependent on each other bombing each other's a bad idea and that gave us a relatively long period of at least the major empires not actually doing kinetic war they did cold war and they did proxy war and there were some insurgency wars and i would say that that world that [2968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2968.88s)

[[bretton woods]] set of agreements is largely broken down and is in final stages of breaking down and what replaces it is a really big question here but since then we went from you know call it two superpowers with nukes to a lot more countries with nukes but also a lot more total types of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] as we're talking about cyber weapons can [2988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=2988.4s)

be catastrophic weapons now by taking out infrastructure and drone weapons are easy and unlike nukes that take [[nation state]] level capacity because uranium enrichment is hard drone weapons don't take [[nation state]] level so non-state actors can have them which means you can't do [[mutually assured destruction]] so [[mutually assured destruction]] only worked when you had two superpowers one [[catastrophe weapon]] now you've got dozens of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] and many dozens of actors that have it and you can't keep up the same gdp globalization growth because we're hitting limits of growth in terms of fundamental resources and um you know biosphere issues okay so now what do we do here so the globalization that that [[bretton woods]] world caused also caused a lot of fragility because what it meant was the world was so interconnected that if things broke down in one area you could start getting cascading breakdowns because of [[supply chain|supply chains]] and so the world got to see oh wow we're very dependent on china for production of lots of things so what happens if a breakdown occurs in china right so one of the things that i saw kobit did and kovit is nowhere near as bad as the pandemics that could happen following in terms of morality or lethality so it was kind of [3062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3062.079s)

like just bad enough to show us how much we're not prepared for [[catastrophic risk]] pandemics or anything which hopefully we take the lesson of right now we have not yet we have not started to increase effective global coordination towards this which is why since making this is critical but um okay so covet's an issue [3081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3081.44s)

so we're gonna shut down travel to stop the movement of the virus well in doing that we also shut down critical [[supply chain|supply chains]] that included things like fertilizers and pesticides that were necessary for the way that agriculture works in many areas of the world to increase food insecurity and increase poverty type dynamics and this is what i [3102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3102.72s)

mean by the way we solve problems causes additional or worse problems we think too myopically if we're trying to solve this but not what will the unintended consequence of this in a very very connected and increasingly fragile world be so the food insecurity in nigeria of 26 million people who were food insecure [3120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3120.24s)

who are now way more food insecure which means boko haram rises and things like that got way worse and in india we've got a few hundred million people in relatively serious food insecurity on top of [[climate change]] already making hotter drier summers and an erosion of groundwater so now in the next few summers where you can have massive die off of crop as a result of the heat so then you know when it's 52 celsius in the heat waves and there's no food and water people don't die peacefully does that work over resource cleave along muslim hindu lines if it does does it become an india pakistan war like this is where you start getting to see the ability for just the normal stuff that is happening to start to really cascade and it doesn't take a big thing to turn into a big thing it can take a little thing and the set of cascades in a very [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3175.2s)

fragile environment to turn into a very big yeah the um you know the um two quick thoughts so one is not to disagree with anything you said cause i agree with that entirely and this might seem flippant but i do have this thought that if cv19 was a little more lethal or killed younger people we would have [3195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3195.76s)

taken it more seriously and it would have ultimately killed less people but your point about how it's kind of laid bare the fragility of our infrastructure the just-in-time world we live in is absolutely real and to put a very harsh point on that the world food program says and it was actually a few months ago [3213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3213.52s)

they said it i think things are getting worse that 265 million people may starve in the next uh 24 months or less because of the disruption caused by this you know relatively mild disease you know put differently what's fascinating about this disease is that it's individually not that lethal but in a community in a [3232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3232.48s)

national level it's quite destructive um so i just wanted to have this for a minute that's a quarter of a billion people right that was half of the entire population of the world at the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] like just to just have a sense of scale there and then typically people don't just die peacefully if they see that other people have resources and so then the question is can insurgencies that don't have comparable weapons cause problems and i think we're all very clear now yes they definitely can and and and they can without really good drones and crispr bio weapons but they [3276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3276.72s)

especially can with those emerging as technologies and so this is also where we get into a place of there are no really good security solutions for anyone that aren't good security solutions for everyone in a world where you have so much systemic interconnectedness and so much fragility and decentralized catastrophe capability so anyone's [3298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3298.88s)

investment in their own security requires more investment in security writ large and boom that's when you get this idea of you have to redesign civilization right if you don't then you have a whole series of processes where you're making the castle walls higher [3314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3314.0s)

and then the trebuchet gets bigger and higher and bigger and higher and bigger and off you go into a uh you know a contentious framework and a comp competitive framework that drives us into the surprise which we find ourselves the um by the way i value the those risk outlines [3329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3329.839s)

those for me because that actually got me to where you are right now in a way that's helpful so thank you well what's what's important about that um is back to this idea about hyper hyper objects is a part of the way people different audiences reflect on different things and respond to different things and daniel [3344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3344.559s)

was making the point about democratic audiences moved by things different than gop audience [[national security]] audience my audience is moved towards the concept of [[climate change]] when you begin to talk about radicalization migration hypernationalization and all these things that happen and you [3358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3358.559s)

can tell the story of the migration from levant into europe and how you this literally happened the last two years you know so we see the very poor stories of the children drowning on the on the banks of the med and then you see the governments of these countries taking in large numbers of migrants and the structure and face of these countries [3377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3377.28s)

changing becoming more nationalists in some instances because of that process and so we've actually gone through this loop already this isn't a future looking crazy dystopian science fiction novel it's germany you know two years ago it's sweden last summer it's like literally happened uh hungry i mean so as examples where you have more of the hyper nationalist election so it seems very theoretical and there's a lot of crazy words flying around that a lot of people are going to have to watch this twice to get but we're living it i think that the destruction of the amazon is a very real u.s [[national security]] threat and this is not in most people's awareness and so it ends up being this kind of leftist environmental issue or whatever but when you understand the hydrological pump of the amazon amazon's very big the water that is transpiring up through the trees that is then raining down on the trees keeping it a rainforest it's keeping it [3437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3437.839s)

so lush and growing so fast that's the hydrological pump that water pump but it's pumping up excess water that then becomes north american rainfall a very significant percentage of total north american rainfall and so just like [[climate change]] has a point at which there's a positive feedback loop meaning with albedo effect in particular [3459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3459.52s)

right if the snow being white is reflecting sunlight less snow cover reflects less sunlight heats faster and you get this kind of runway effect the similar thing with the amazon is that it's postulated at a certain point you get an enough loss of tree cover that you get decreased rainfall on the rain forest creating increased susceptibility to fires and whatever and [3482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3482.079s)

you actually get a break of the hydrological pump and groups like noaa and nasa and other ones are modeling when that happens and there are forecasts anywhere from like a year from now to 20 years from now but like none are very long based on current rates of destruction of the amazon obviously you could just mess up the [3500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3500.079s)

headwaters of the amazon in ecuador and mess the whole thing up so it doesn't it's not just again based on total acreage of farming or mining or whatever it's also based on criticality um but what would happen if that runaway break to the hydrological pump occurred that dropped north american rainfall by 30 to 50 percent [3520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3520.4s)

what that does to agriculture into our aquifers it basically means that we have lost food security and domestic kinds of independent capacity so i think that should be thought of as a [[national security]] threat and the state department should pay attention to it so but here's a perfect example of again i like your your induction this idea to [3540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3540.16s)

us with a hyper object here's an example of something that is actually quite linear and gets the american farmer and the voter boom um and a unfortunately to some extent it's dependent on a belief in [[climate change]] and that whole science which a whole group of american voters aren't going to buy although [3559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3559.119s)

president a president biden certainly does and interesting as you're saying this you might remember he mentioned the amazon rainforest in his debate with trump which i thought was very odd um maybe this is why he did i didn't think it was a really powerful thing for him to go for based on the voters he's trying to mobilize right now probably wrong [3578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3578.72s)

um but here's an example of something where like i get it i buy it you you motivated me um i just kind of know with this system of government it ain't gonna happen like that message is not gonna get to the right people we're not gonna take behaviors that do that and you and i and some of our friends have talked about actually relatively creative and not that [3597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3597.44s)

expensive ways to get them to stop bringing another rainforest right so we live in a system daniel where that very clear negative causal loop is going to continue because we don't know how to absorb it we live we have a complexity mismatch problem obviously with our decision makers we have an acceleration of history with our technology you know etc [3617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3617.839s)

and then we live in this media environment where we don't share facts so so great work stating the problem set and it probably was worth getting into the actual central threat and my 11 year old left the room at that time so i'm not going to get a call from some of his his friend's parents although i'm sure i [3634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3634.559s)

will for something else so let's begin to talk about if we can let's some solutions uh and it and i have a whole series of questions i want to get to but let's just let's open it up what do we do about it yeah tiny part of the problem statement on [[climate change]] just because it's going to be directly relevant to the solution yeah of course i would say our sense-making around [[climate change]] is actually very problematic uh not just [[sensemaking]] the climate but since making the related issues and the political climate and the the memetic climate of how people are going [3675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3675.839s)

to relate to it so let's say that all of the scientists agreed on the [[climate change]] model which they don't right you actually have like call it the standard model which is ipcc but you have some very serious scientists like lovelock who think it's much more severe than the ipcc's model [3695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3695.839s)

and hit jim hanson i mean he lays it out brilliantly and you've got very serious scientists who are earnest who are not paid by oil companies like freeman dyson who think that it's less severe because of how he calculates [[nonlinear dynamics]] and so there's there is like some authentic scientific inquiry around it but let's say that [3715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3715.2s)

there was just total consensus of the thing that we had to do there but the solution is bound up with the acceptance of the problem statement and the way it's presented in the public sphere so the solution is going to be carbon taxes um that have to get agreed upon as some international order and then there's this idea that that's going to slow gdp growth and [3735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3735.119s)

uh so the us and whatever european countries agree to it if there are other countries like say china or iran that don't agree to it then they have marginal increase in gdp growth relative to us that they can continue to reinvest in silk road military whatever it is that increases their geopolitical position with regard to [3760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3760.0s)

the rest of the world and so you'll see people rejecting [[climate change]] without ever really trying to make sense of [[climate change]] because they think the consequence of the solution affects something that they feel or care about more and this is where you can't try to think about [[climate change]] without also thinking about the economy and geopolitics right so just to be explicit on what you're talking about this is probably a rational response from a [[climate change]] denier actually that's not wrong that's wrong a rational response from someone on the right to we have to instill these solutions on [[climate change]] is very much along the lines of what you're saying it's just too expensive and i now i'm going to find all sorts of excuses to deny the science because what you're suggesting is expensive and by the way a lot of what you're describing goes counter to my view of how government ought to work it's starting to sound pretty socialist i don't really like where you're going [3810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3810.72s)

and so this is where the adequate [[sensemaking]] has to be not just of a problem but the way the [[problem space]] interconnects because otherwise we'll come up with a solution that solves that problem externalizes harm somewhere else the people who are connected to where the harm is externalized will vehemently oppose it [3828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3828.559s)

and the coordination cost is too high to do anything so this is where there is a level of good faith discourse and the level of really good problem understanding before presenting solutions because if we present a solution prematurely it ends up being wrong because maybe even if it's right in that narrow domain [3846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3846.079s)

it's wrong in other domains and so this also requires the ability to process more complexity first because being able to say well let's make sense of [[climate change]] with before we present a solution well now it becomes easier if my acceptance of science around [[climate change]] doesn't automatically mean that i'm also [3866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3866.0s)

accepting a solution that i think harms something i care about i can just get online with the [[sensemaking]] but then i'm like i also want you to get online with what we're thinking about geopolitics with regard to china and economic growth and the problems of sowing economic growth if we can make sense of those things [3881](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3881.44s)

together then we can start to say is there a better solution set that addresses those things together okay so now we're okay good so we're getting towards this ideo solution set i got to tell you at this point fully aware of some of these systems dynamics fully aware of the challenge we have fully aware of who our decisions makers are and who [3900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3900.559s)

they're likely to be i'm pessimistic so why don't we um let's start talking about how to fix it is the consilience project a good place to start or yeah i mean for instance the consilience project is a project that we're working on right now and you know you and i have talked about this uh discussed ways that ergo can uh be in relationship and we're honored we're honored to be a part of it i think it's a big bold ambitious idea and i and i want you and and i want tom and i to um you know we before we started this call we read a bunch a little bit of the stuff and we have some you know we have a bit of a view of what it is i want to hear more about it from you and then i want us to engage you on on i want to see if you can turn my pessimism to optimism and i doubt you can so i mean first i'll just say on that i i don't want people to have an optimism [3960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3960.4s)

bias when they're doing [[sensemaking]] i want their [[sensemaking]] to be as full and clear as possible because otherwise they'll come up with wrong solutions i want their optimism to only be kind of in the space of what it is that engenders someone to work on solutions that aren't obvious in the presence of very hard problems right it's not [3982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=3982.16s)

optimistic about a false solution set it's optimistic about innovation possibly that would have them work towards it so i think we're going to agree about the significance and difficulty and entrenchment of the problem set and then what we want to look at is what would a sufficient solution be and before we have a sufficient solution [4000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4000.319s)

in the same way that problems can cascade can we start to get solution cascades where something that is not sufficient can give rise to more things that start to converge towards sufficient i like the idea the consilience project is itself not sufficient at all uh but i do believe that it increases the likelihood of many other positive [4019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4019.44s)

things that start to converge towards sufficiency um and i'll i'll just say like so the consensus project has to do with how to really support a new kind of [[cultural enlightenment]] at scale we'll get into that but there are other approaches that other friends and colleagues have that i think [4039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4039.039s)

are also very valuable like you know i have some colleagues and their focus is hey two to five thousand families own all the world's wealth uh and they're increasingly more powerful than [[nation state|nation states]] in a lot of ways they don't have land they have to protect they don't have constitutions that they're bound to [4057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4057.2s)

uh when nobody will use weapons of mass destruction their access to private military contractors is functionally as big as [[nation state]] military capacities are and algorithmic trading of money on money dynamics means we're not going to escape that so why focus on the population who are too dumb and to control just focus [4075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4075.039s)

on getting those families to rule better in the new emergent feudalism that's inescapable that's a compelling argument that the new emergent feudalism that's inescapable that's a particular model i'm not saying that i agree with it but i think there's a lot of good thought and and validity to [4090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4090.0s)

saying where there's a power law distribution of power give a disproportional amount of attention to the top of the power stack if you can influence it consensus project's the exact opposite of that right now it's actually a a more kind of i want to add one little thought to that for people who are paying attention to this [4110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4110.159s)

um the the top 1 of the united states controls 60 of the wealth or something like that but more critically the bottom 20 percent of america has a negative amount of wealth because they're in debt the bottom 50 percent only controls like six percent of the wealth like the distribution is extraordinary and it's getting worse and worse and worse just to to add some emphasis the point you made before my first statistic was wrong i can look it up but conceptually i'm not sure people quite realize uh what the wealth distribution looks like in this country and how different it was from the 80s and sorry go ahead and you know just to [4141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4141.6s)

understand that if i have more capital and capital equals optionality towards all other kinds of resources maximum liquidity and optionality i can control private militaries i can control media i can influence politicians through campaign budgets and lobbying and um revolving door type dynamics and so to the degree that i need to [4163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4163.839s)

influence social dynamics i have the capacity um and then even though you know when you talk about that distribution one percent is kind of misleading we're mostly talking about point zero zero one percent that have real top level financial capacity that i would say disproportionately [4186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4186.56s)

control something like 90 plus percent of the way that the financial sector itself moves and i got this doubt here it's the bottom 50 percent of the united states controls tom what what percentage of the u.s wealth do you think the bottom 50 of america owns and by the way daniel's [4203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4203.36s)

point is the control function's even higher but actually owns tom what do you think the bottom 50 percent of america what percentage of the of the u.s wealth do you think they own i'm gonna go with one yeah it's 2.5 percent 2.5 and that basically is homes and 401ks this is not influencing right it's got [4222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4222.08s)

it's got no scalar opportunity exactly um and poor people are not good at hiding their wealth wealthier people are better at hiding their wealth because it's quite useful oftentimes to do so so the numbers okay but just footnote i i'm sorry to drive you off i think part of the problem we have today by the way [4244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4244.48s)

is that rich people and and certain celebrities or others are not hunting their wealth and that they're in they're invoking massive memetic response and if you go back to the 80s it was the lifestyle was rich and famous that woke a lot of people up to rich people right like there's all these great stories of folks who grew up you know [4261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4261.92s)

poor didn't quite realize they were poor until thanksgiving when the next door neighbor's cousin showed up from chicago and he drove in a cadillac that was wealthy now the wealth of the you know the wealth of the wealthy is is thrown in our fa it's called keeping up with the kardashians for a reason right because you can't keep up with them and [4279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4279.76s)

you're going to see their face day after day of their wealth and their extravagance day after day sorry daniel go ahead yes okay so where were we supposed to go before we got into well we were getting towards solutions and and you were and you were talking about there's a variety of solutions and you were talking about one [4298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4298.4s)

about about you know sort of reinforcing a feudal state okay so and how the consilience project is exact opposite i believe that the long-term solutions look pretty meaningfully different than the social solutions humans have tried so far like i don't think the very long-term solutions are nation-state-based um i don't think they look like a single type of fungible currency and primarily private property ownership or whatever rule of law enforced by monopoly of violence in the same way i'm talking about many generations from now i'm not going to get into that because [4342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4342.239s)

that's that's hard what i will say is [[nation state|nation states]] and global markets and and you know rule of law at the level of states is going to be what continues to primarily be how civilization operates for the next couple generations at least and so we have to make that system meaningfully better [4369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4369.12s)

how do we vector it in the right direction and so i'm going to be assuming our existing types of institutions and looking at how to correct some of the institutional decay that has occurred i think institutional decay is an important concept because some people naively still run this idea of a continuous dialectic of progress where [4387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4387.92s)

things just get better and better and better as a result of say technology and accumulated learning and i think it's very clear to see with the loss of the burning of alexandria in the dark ages and the loss of the uh you know classical greek enlightenment and whatever [4405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4405.36s)

there's actually periods of emergence of things getting better and then getting worse in meaningful ways and cyclicality and and major empires and civilizations do fall the important thing to understand is when the roman empire fell or when the byzantine or maya or aztec or egyptian empire fell [4420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4420.08s)

they were not fully globalized civilizations they were still local civilizations because of globalization if the kind of civilization stat meaning how it does its modes of production falls now like every other one always has its scope of consequence is unprecedented but failure is not [4440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4440.719s)

unprecedented in fact there's no other precedent okay so coming back to the idea of a [[liberal democracy]] for a moment i'm going to make this kind of u.s centric and immediate is roughly you've got these kind of three sectors you've got this market thing you've got this state [4460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4460.719s)

thing and you've got this civil society thing that is not market or state but is uh religions and community groups and other places where basically the cultural values act so the rough idea and i'm not saying that this is adequate or true but the rough kind of idea is uh okay the we're gonna let the market [4489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4489.12s)

do most of the modes of production and most of the incentive and most of the innovation because it's good at it and we don't want a central government that is too strong trying to do too much of that because we founded this country getting away from excessive powers of government and we want something that is more individual self-determining but we're not doing a pure laissez-faire market either we still make a state because we like the idea of rule of law because a market will have a market for nasty things like slaves and organs and uh whatever uh and so things that we like to call crime and be able to have a force to stop them and specifically it's recognized that even if if at t equals zero i gave everyone an exact equal amount of money in enough period of time we would get a power law distribution no matter what because some people are better at making money with it and then having more money gives them more ability to make more money and so the the power ends up being auto poetic [4551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4551.52s)

and falling on power law distribution so then how how do the few people up here who have the incentive and capacity to maintain their [[asymmetric power]] not be excessively kind of inhumane to the rest of everybody else well everybody else pulls their power into this thing called a government of [4572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4572.64s)

foreign by the people estate that has monopoly of violence it's going to have even more power than the most powerful economic actors have and it can bind them with rule of law and rule of law is where our cultural our values because the basis of jurisprudence is ethics right the basis of ethics is some kind of [[value system]] or metaphysics so we have some kind of [[value system]] that is the basis of jurisprudence at the basis of rule of law we bequeath a monopoly of violence to enforce rule of law to a state that had to be able to check largely the predatory aspects of markets the primary kind of role of the state's enforce rule of law is largely to keep people [4612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4612.56s)

from doing things that they would otherwise have an incentive to do people or corporations and uh where we agree that that's not a good thing to do so the idea is that the purpose of the state is largely checking predatory aspects of markets while keeping functional aspects of markets but that's only possible as long as the [4630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4630.32s)

people are checking the state because otherwise the representatives in the state will end up the market will seek to capture those representatives the watchdog issue the classic libertarian critique and think hey instead of regulating against my interest regulate in my interest and you'll have better houses in the [4648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4648.64s)

hamptons and swiss bank accounts and a re-election budget and whatever else and given that lobbyists are paid for by somebody and election budgets have to come from somewhere and whatever and then you start to get revolving door dynamics so the founding fathers knew this so they said you know comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government adequate [[fourth estate]] the government of formed by the people people actively involved and it'll probably break down and it'll break down for these reasons as the people won't stay actively involved because it's too expensive um and mo it's very easy to complain about [4680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4680.64s)

government while not actively investing hardly any of our life and trying to be involved in governance yeah and then we're basically de facto consenting to be ruled and just complaining so the idea is that if you want to prevent the kind of decay of a republic into crony capitalism and eventually a kleptocracy [4700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4700.719s)

and an autocracy the basis of it has to be a comprehensively educated public who knows how to make sense of the types of things that occur like market incentives like narrative and info warfare like problems with political science etc and who are both comprehensively educated in knowing how to make sense of [4721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4721.76s)

stuff who know how to communicate dialectically with people who see stuff differently because they know that's how you sublimate war and who have some access to current information i.e a good [[fourth estate]] so that they but where they still have the capacity to parse it and sense make it themselves [4738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4738.48s)

if you don't have that as a basis you do not have the possibility for [[participatory governance]] there is no republic there's just an illusion of it well it's actually some kind of um oligarchy or something so the goal of consensus project is the acknowledgements that the two of the pillars of or like not even pillars prerequisites for [4759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4759.84s)

democracy or a republic or subsidiary or [[participatory governance]] of any kind are an adequate [[public education]] that is teaching people how to make sense of the world well enough that they can participate in governance and a [[fourth estate]] that's giving people information about the current world that actually gives them it is an information commons right that gives them the access to the information that they need to be without distortion be able to meaningfully do [[sensemaking]] on it so they can do choice making and what i would say is that both [[public education]] and news and a bunch of other things have gone through institutional decay where they are no longer serving that function and the prerequisites or the antecedents of democracy don't exist and we have to basically reboot them and i'm not trying to reboot them through a top-down process of how do we get government to fix [[public education]] and get adequate civics and [4816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4816.8s)

whatever or legislate news but a bottom-up process of how do we actually just start to educate people about the fact that right now the right is pretty sure that the left news is fake news and lying and the left things the rights news is fake news line what they don't get is that all the news is fake news and lying to various degrees but [4836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4836.08s)

if we can show across the whole news landscape either fake facts or if not fake facts at least cherry picked facts yes this fact was true but these 10 other facts were omitted that give you a very different sense and then it was contextualized and spun like this so even if it's not full-on lying it's [4853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4853.52s)

still misleading in the nature of curing contextual nonsense right and so there's a kind of media literacy that people would need and you know why drain the swamp was so effective is people feel corruption as a real thing and people don't want to be manipulated but [4874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4874.0s)

to the degree that someone's saying they're manipulating you so trust me that's an effective manipulation tactic um and so what we actually need is for people to start trusting their own capacity for better [[sensemaking]] and have that trust be warranted because they're actually getting better at sense-making and not just individually but collectively meaning i'm also getting better at not just trying to sense make-based reality but try to understand what do other people think and why do they think that so that because i know that if i just try to ignore or cancel a big part of the population they don't stop [4908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4908.08s)

existing and acting they do stuff and if i do effective stuff they'll do effective counter stuff and strategy means factoring counter response so if i want to do that effectively i'm going to be better if i can actually understand them and see if there is some way to be able to work towards um better shared solutions so the consensus project is looking at [4925](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4925.84s)

can we actually reboot a republic here can we reboot [[participatory governance]] in some way and even deeper than that globally we're not really succeeding with the sdgs very well we are not we didn't do nuclear disarmament sustainable development goals yeah any of the large global issues [4944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4944.0s)

we're not doing uh preventing the ai [[arms race]] or whatever we we we're mostly not doing a good job at global problem solving and that's a coordination issue either we don't understand how to solve it or what some people think a solution is other people actively are opposing or you get [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] where there's things like [[arms race]] [[race to the bottom]] type scenarios to solve the coordination jews requires some kind of shared choice making and the basis of that is shared [[sensemaking]] communication and that and the base of that is not in a state or market but in culture right a [[value system]] around better [[sensemaking]] and better good faith dialogue right now those are not even highly valued things they're not trained but they're not even very highly valued okay so within so so just to redefine here to help people kind of follow along so you've got government markets and culture inside the concept of culture uh to prevent the decay of the assistant government in [4999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=4999.76s)

which you live into a kleptocracy we need to have people who are capable of overseeing and participating in government and right now we effectively don't that's only going to become more of a problem as the world accelerates around us and more technology matters more complexity matters and we have a complexity mismatch problem but actual participation in governance is critical and only can happen with people who are aware or or educated enough and to be able to have that role and you get back to the thomas jefferson fdr h.r mcmaster quotes about an educated populist being not only critical for democracy but also a great deterrent to war [5034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5034.159s)

and when i so when i think about actual launching points one thing we've talked about is and before corona one thing that gave me a sense of optimism was there was an increasing amount of training or education for children and self-awareness meditation you kind of get into like anti-bias [5055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5055.76s)

training understanding the flaws of the wet computer between our ears right so when people begin to understand that you know everything that is us is us drives us and and we are is 120 000 year old white computer that's driven by biases and heuristics and pushes this bag of meat around you can begin to get people to you know [5072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5072.4s)

sort of get that user manual for how we work who we are and then they can enter you know an education environment is there an amount of self-awareness and bias training and you were saying sort of media awareness that's a necessary prerequisite of education for an educated populist thereby [5091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5091.679s)

relevant to to help lead this country in an upward trajectory yeah so if we're if we're going to discuss kind of like the anatomy of the [[problem space]] of what broke [[sensemaking]] and kind of civic fabric down which then gives the categories of work that need to happen there's absolutely a bunch in the way of um decay in [[public education]] yeah we can kind of look at why there's a bunch of reasons but let me let me just sort of lean you over towards and what what what does consilience project what are other ideas what are some solutions to i know you're you're being very responsible about [5134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5134.96s)

illustrating the problem set but looking at the clock and hoping to keep it at two hours what are some solutions um so the consensus project i mean basically we're trying to support what we see as an emergent but not yet recognized cultural movement towards better [[sensemaking]] in better dialogue as the fabric of society in which problem-solving of any kinds of problems that we care about can happen and let's just talk about that for a second so this is a movement that you know if you think about what is that um i like pina coladas that that silly song about the guy who meets the girl in the dunes uh help me out here and there's there's [5173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5173.76s)

a joke in there about you know if you don't like yoga right so like in the 70s it was cool to not like yoga and make fun of people meditate and we are certainly moving more towards you know a person who meditates or thinks about self-awareness is no longer a standout freak but maybe there is a cultural movement towards oh [5190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5190.32s)

maybe self-awareness is a worthwhile thing maybe expanding our circles of empathy is a good thing is that is that part of what you're talking about do you believe that's right do you believe there's more of a possibility in this country to touch talk about these soft things that are historically non-masculine [5208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5208.239s)

and non-testosterone driven and thereby lots of people ran away from them i mean i really appreciated your conversation with general mcmaster where he was talking about empathy because it didn't seem soft and feminine and it actually seemed directly relevant both to preventing war and being successful at war [5228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5228.719s)

and i think it was it's a it's an important frame that empathy is not the thing that people who are unaware of [[conflict theory]] do and that makes you kind of bad at [[conflict theory]] or or winning um sun tzu saying do you understand the opponent and if you're going into battle you don't effective at unders i have to understand my opponent but also to be able to prevent war to be able to sublimate it through some kind of political compromise i have to actually really get what the other people think and feel and need to say what are the right solutions here so um i think empathy i mean and this is [5266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5266.56s)

this is actually partly why sociopaths oftentimes have higher cognitive empathy than the average person but lower embodied empathy is that they're good at modeling someone else's theory of mind to gain theoretically beat them but without actually caring um and so you can weaponize empathy and that's something we have to be very [5288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5288.96s)

careful about um that's you know cult leaders are good at that cluster b disorders are good at kind of a weaponized empathy uh but uh okay do you want me to stay on the empathy mindfulness or come back to the what do i see as the critical parts of the solution because i think that it's not purely cognitive right the [5309](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5309.6s)

development that we need in people is not purely cognitive training to be able to understand [[existential risk|existential risks]] and [[climate change]] and and even social science and politics it's also if they move into outrage too quickly if they move into overwhelm too quickly they're going to be useless [5332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5332.239s)

or problematic or make things worse so there's also an emotional intelligence and you know you go back to looking at like the greeks exploring this the stoic school and the aristotelian school and the socratic school kind of were all parts of something that was more complete together that weren't complete on their own right the aristotelian school was can we actually understand the formal logic and the kind of scientific thinking and natural philosophy to make sense of [[base reality]] together the socratic schools can we understand each other can we take all of the various perspectives in the debate the stoic schools can we understand ourselves enough that we don't get hijacked by our own emotions [5367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5367.76s)

if we can understand [[base reality]] we can understand each other and we can understand ourselves we can start to get somewhere and so in terms of what is the necessary [[cultural enlightenment]] of this time it definitely requires at least all three of those facets fair enough and um talk a little bit more about how you're [5390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5390.32s)

going to achieve some or all of that with or i know you said it's not an entirely it's not an entire solution set but talk about how consilience project is going to be valuable in that end to that end yeah so if you don't mind two major kind of parts of it there's a kind of movement coalescing part [5409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5409.36s)

and a kind of education and content part the education and content part is us working on developing something like better news and which is the assessment of [[base reality]] so what are the most consequential things happening in the world and what do we know what is an overview of the topic that is we can't say unbiased but we can say [5431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5431.679s)

bias corrected i'll explain that in a minute what do we have high certainty on about this topic what do we have low certainty on why do we think it's consequential and what are the questions we're asking and the indicators we're watching to see how this thing unfolds and even framing it that way helps educate people how to be better sense [5450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5450.48s)

makers for them to even notice in themselves where do i have high confidence or do i have low confidence and what is my basis of confidence did i just come to high confidence emotionally or because a leader that i like said it i didn't look at the data myself right so even just starting to calibrate [5464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5464.4s)

those things and then to emphasize questions more than propositions and think about why something is consequential that factors second and third order effects this is all giving people information but also training them how to process information by the way that we're processing it built into the presentation [5480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5480.96s)

but then if someone's like well why did you come to that certainty why would i trust you we like don't trust us actually trust your own ability to make sense of things if you so here's this weekly intelligence report of critical things going on but and we're trying to present it as simply as [5500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5500.159s)

possible but if you want to click under the hood you can see how we derived it what things did we read what data sets did we look at how did we make sense of it how what epistemic models did we apply and how did we calibrate confidence now it's kind of a better than but parallel to a peer-reviewed scientific study on [5516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5516.88s)

what's actually going on there's some parallel to that there is some parallel to that and so now somebody can look at it and one if they think we missed the data set or miss waited something they can let us know and we will be continuously updating our models and correcting our positions transparently right which is really important [5535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5535.44s)

including doing retrospectives of where we got things wrong or missed stuff which is another important thing is a kind of epistemic humility for people to not be focused on being right but focused on earnest inquiry which involves being very clear where you're wrong and uh but also they get to see like wow if this if i didn't have this order to [5553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5553.36s)

make sense of it for me if i went and looked at all of these different types of news sources from different countries and different political perspectives and i applied these models and i parsed it this way i could make better sense of stuff too so right it's teaching people [[sensemaking]] and then also hopefully well okay that's one part so basically that's the news the meta news is where we're not making sense of [[base reality]] but we're making sense of the media landscape and helping people have a better kind of media literacy and understanding of the narrative in info warfare so that they kind of get inoculated against it [5584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5584.4s)

was it i think one of the newspapers in washington post or something and as soon as i mentioned any newspaper everyone's going to have their built-in biases about the biases of the paper but one of them used to publish documents like the government released this statement and then would have sort of journalists commenting on the [5598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5598.88s)

document on the way down it was a pretty neat tool um to help us unders when they say this they're trying to you know fool you with anc you know blah blah you know yeah so that kind of commentary right so what we're seeking to do here is that this project is a non-profit it commits to have no profit stream it won't [5618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5618.56s)

put anything behind a pay wall won't sell anybody's data won't have ads and so uh there's no vested interest in that way the articles that are written are all written by the house like the economist no journalists names are on them to both make it safer for them to say what's true even if it's controversial um and for people to have to deal with [5637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5637.52s)

the content as the content rather than have a kind of ad hominem or identity politics approach to it um and the organization will shut down after five years the nonprofit has a five year time to live so that it's not a progressive jobs program or career opportunity for anybody and it's not [5653](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5653.04s)

positioned to have a part of the power landscape it's trying to catalyze something trying to catalyze something culturally that will happen outside of it so any group that's trying to do good [[sensemaking]] couldn't see us as being in competition we only succeed long term if we get a lot of other groups to succeed [5668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5668.239s)

and so i'll mention that in a moment the movement building part yeah that's a big question i have the meta news part is where we take some topic that is trending and highly polarized like masks or hydroxychloroquine or lab origins of covid or whatever it is and or police violence as a function of [5694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5694.159s)

institutional racism in the us and we start by saying what is the landscape of primary narrative sometimes there's just two narratives there's kind of a left and a right narrative or whatever sometimes there's like five narratives there's also like a strong libertarian critique of both there's a conspiracy narrative whatever and of course there's a thousand [5712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5712.8s)

sub-variants but they kind of cluster to some primary narrative structures or tropes so we do this thing in the meta news saying here's the narrative landscape of the things that are trending that a lot of people believe sure and then we steel man each narrative which is the opposite of straw manning which means we try to make the [5728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5728.719s)

strongest case for it possible because most people who aren't in a narrative either don't know that the narrative exists or can only think that the people who believe it are just kind of dumb and bad they don't have a compelling understanding of why anyone could believe that thing because the version [5745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5745.199s)

that that their [[social media]] algorithm is curating is the one that will appeal to outrage for them or whatever so we want to actually be able to help people understand actually what is com what the narratives are what's compelling about them this part of the socratic process of do we understand each other then we want to convert those narratives to a bunch of propositions and say what evidence is given to support these and then beyond that what evidence can we find to either formally falsify or verify and if we can't falsify or verify can we at least find things that make it more or less likely and how do we calibrate that so we're teaching people first to assess [5779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5779.52s)

a narrative landscape then to empathize with other people in the form of can i try to really steel man their argument which is also good faith dialogue right then analytic propositional logic can i actually go through and because what will oftentimes happen is like this is true this is true therefore these [5798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5798.0s)

eight propositions you already got me on these two these have no data but the people just kind of believe it right and that that type of thing we want to go through and be able to say because then what we'll also be able to show is in everyone's narrative there's some true stuff there is some signal which is actually also very important to realize [5814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5814.08s)

then we can also see that across most of them there's some falsifiable like clearly nonsense but also a lot of just cherry-picked and spun stuff and then a lot of stuff that's pure conjecture that we can either falsify nor verify that is basically just spin or whatever we usually have low confidence then we step back and say [5834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5834.719s)

what can we say with high confidence about this topic after having looked at all this so we're not saying unbiased we're saying we're taking each bias on purpose so we can bias correct right um so now one of the things that will happen is we'll also be able to show exemplars of each of the narratives like the top news sources and show okay [5853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5853.76s)

here's where they put spin on this thing here's where the nature of the title is misleading but it's what you walk away with from what the actual science said or whatever and here's where they cherry picked so people start looking for cherry picking they start looking for spin all over the place so they're getting inoculated [5869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5869.92s)

against the tools of memetic and [[narrative warfare]] and as a result tribalism and strong leader dynamics and whatever and starting to actually think so there so news meta news then there's some other deeper education stuff long form pieces about things going on in the world if you really want to understand [5888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5888.88s)

well what's going on in the china-india border or with 5g or whatever it is deeper things in there but again what we're doing is trying to teach people how to make sense of the world in the process of making sense of something they care about now that is largely to start being a strange attractor of people who are seeking better information [5908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5908.0s)

and showing people what the [[fourth estate]] could be to increase demand for higher quality things to try to create a race to the top in the media environment rather than the [[race to the bottom]] of more salacious shorter et cetera that has been there so then in the movement coalescing side we're working on putting together innovation challenge okay so then just [5930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5930.08s)

to locate people so what you've just described is an extraordinarily gorgeous orchestra of information that i would love to see i'm excited to be part of um you know as as you've just painted it that would be an unbelievably immense and beautiful gorgeous thing to read to look at to [5946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5946.88s)

to see and learn from now you would you say movement building and and i know we're gonna run out of time quickly you're can you describe i guess faster than yeah how do you get it sounds like an elite focused thing how do you get the rest of the country that to pay attention to this as we started building this and started reaching out to advisors and people working in the space we started finding hundreds of really brilliant projects to increase [[sensemaking]] public dialogue that just either didn't recognize themselves as part of a movement or needed help getting a certain kind of traction so there were some groups who had built [5981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5981.76s)

uh tech that could be made as a web browser plugin and fact check any site that you're on news sites highlight things that look like facts and then identify data sources where you can go check those facts and that should be a web browser plug-in everybody has and it should be [5999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=5999.84s)

continuously getting assessed and being made better there was another group based on lakhov's work that made a kind of semantic processor that could identify across new sources narrative framing and show the frames that were being used show news organizations using the same frames and where you could look at the [6015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6015.44s)

same topic across different framings of it that should be a web browser plug-in that  __  everybody has so they can understand the principles of statistical cherry picking and data manipulation and narrative manipulation but then they can web browser plug it and see it in real time and the stuff that they're scrolling on [6031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6031.119s)

facebook when it pops up they can see those things and so then that starts to create an incentive to find the ones that are less manipulated which starts to create a race to the top of an orientation of the media to offer different supply because the demand is changing through education but those types of projects were like [6049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6049.44s)

man we really want to help those projects succeed because some of them just were like a few computer scientists working on their own they got to it but then they don't have the resources to take it further or an academic institute a media lab got it somewhere but then it's not part of their mandate to take it further so we're like we want to host innovation [6066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6066.32s)

prizes we also saw people who were doing really good jobs of like making cartoons to teach american history and civics to high school kids but it hasn't scaled it was like being done in one town but that same thing should scale all over the place what's that like the oatmeal i don't know the oatmeal oh you don't my god okay there we go you [6084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6084.48s)

check it out when we're done you're gonna love it there are people who are working on how to make peer review better or remove bias in journalism or bias in academic science or get better at identifying state-sponsored [[narrative warfare]] in the u.s other states and what we're saying is [6099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6099.6s)

those are all parts of one issue that people haven't recognized as one issue which is the breakdown of [[sensemaking]] writ large and i think by even bringing them into one environment they start to get more self-awareness that these are all parts of one thing and there is a cultural movement towards valuing [[sensemaking]] a dot and high quality dialogue as the basis [6116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6116.8s)

of our capacity to solve problems and then our ability to curate the resources that are actually good and direct people to the resources that are good the ability to create forums for the right kinds of interactions where the architectures incent good [[sensemaking]] in good faith dialogue and prizes that help both new [6134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6134.0s)

projects emerge and that change the nature of demand for existing projects and where the products we're making are really like prototyping and then open sourcing what it could be and encouraging anyone to rip it off like you want to take this to your country and implement it or locality or whatever awesome [6149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6149.04s)

so the goal is movement catalyzing in a finite period of time and education and kind of the attractor basis i love that i thought you were going to describe how to build a movement to get people to look at the consilience project you're talking about using the consilience project to create a movement on a couple of levels [6165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6165.92s)

a movement towards driving people to higher quality journalism and movement towards sort of an incubator of great tools to help that happen etc uh that's that's fascinating um we're running out of time quickly so go ahead the the underlying just is that there's a commons just like there's a commons of [6185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6185.04s)

air or water that can easily fall prey to tragedy of the commons dynamics there's an information in [[epistemic commons]] the data the data we need and the processing on that data we need to make sense of the world to decide what good solutions for anything are and that information [[epistemic commons]] is not stewarded right it's gruesomely [6202](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6202.8s)

polluted and it's there's maximum incentive to manipulate that comment i think that's a really important concept you'll understand the information comments tom i um i imagine you have a lot of thoughts but i i don't want to put you in the spot but well i'll give you my um i mean i love sort of walking down the [6223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6223.92s)

road the way we walk down the road um you know i have to admit selfishly i got a very powerful description of why i do what i do every day i mean literally i i wouldn't have defined the problem the way you define the problem but i'm talking about the same problem i wouldn't have defined the solution the way you define the solution but that's [6244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6244.0s)

what i do every day i mean literally i mean i guess an important difference for us is like we're very focused on story and it's really about meaning shared you know we do these gatherings all over the place and you know relatively unscientifically i can tell you that ninety percent of the people when they have that opportunity [6261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6261.119s)

to share meaning they love each other i'm and i use that word specifically i believe in that word sounds corny and loose but it's real and and ultimately you're talking about a very similar kind of thing if i have a fear if i were going to define my fear and i say fear because i want you to win um you know one is the bummer and i say it's a bummer because i i think i used to not believe this was the case is that even with creative projects the winner works the hardest like the winner just busts his or her ass and redoes it 5 000 times until it's good and and and that element of this idea i think is huge which is to say [6304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6304.8s)

there's going to be a steven spielberg of even what you do even if it's the way the gizmo looks even if it's the way the interface works with the way the stair the story sort of winds its way in or when you start to think about a movement it's critically an emotional thing you know and that storytelling thing being so critical if i'm [6326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6326.08s)

if if there's something i i would be afraid of one of them is i love the idea of the five year thing i just don't know if that holds what i would hope it would hold and then the second part is i'm not sure not for profit attracts the kind of killers you need and i that may be a pessimistic cynical view but i think there are people who more and more can hold both things i mean think about like a rock like great musicians think of the grateful dead ironically they were capitalists now they weren't capitalist firsts but they didn't do it not for profit there's a freedom there there's a risk there that i think creates [6376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6376.48s)

something that's just different this is my own philosophy i'm not i know i'm not 100 percent right on this but i think there's this interesting pro for-profit not-for-profit thing that's hitting a new place and that part makes me anxious but anyway but okay so those were my i spent time talking about my fears and criticisms but like [6398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6398.639s)

i'm talking about like the little part at the end as opposed to everything i heard before and i love it and i and listen i think it's um i think to be passionate again in this country about education because unfortunately it's been about money you know we keep talking about money and we keep saying it's about [6417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6417.119s)

debt and we keep saying it's about higher ed my view is it's different ed higher i don't i don't even like how you gonna draw that line um and what's it really about like what what is is is learning about a job is that really what it's about i know that's an important piece of the puzzle i wouldn't i don't want to diminish that [6437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6437.36s)

but what you're talking about is nobler i mean it just is and so how do we celebrate that as a culture again because we don't celebrate it that much like the notion of what a liberal arts education is or what it should be i say should what i what i think it could be man i'm not sure we even jump up and [6454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6454.639s)

down about that anymore i i don't know i don't hear it very often i really like that you use the word noble because it's um there was a thing before democracy you know called the nobility as one governance system of some people who uh for whatever reason were developed or [6478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6478.08s)

believed to intrinsically have but largely developed the capacity for good judgment and uh you know [[decision making]] that that involved nobility not just you know cognitive capacities and nobility moving from being a class of people to being a distributed characteristic right is one of the core essences of the democratic republic [6500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6500.8s)

i know and the idea of democracy as we all have a say that [[participatory governance]] we always say and what happens so there was this idea that the internet would democratize access to information everybody could have access to information but when there's a billion search results on anything [6520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6520.239s)

access to information is utterly useless information processing is the key and there is not a democratization of information processing you have groups that have access to massive big data analysis and private and public intelligence and most everyone else who only has access to [[narrative warfare]] aimed at them and so if you want to have [6537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6537.92s)

anything like a democracy you actually have to have democratization of information processing what we're trying to do is to be able to provide information that is the quality and nature of information that the top level institutional decision makers currently get to everyone because the idea of a decision maker is [6553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6553.44s)

an anti-democratic idea this is why it's a non-profit is we will not put it behind a paywall is because it it will be fully available with no manipulation will require an email or anything for everybody now if people want to make for-profit news institutions as part of the movement awesome we want people to make [6568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6568.96s)

for-profit private intelligence companies and news organizations and whatever as well as non-profit ones but the stewarding group that is stewarding the information commons must have no other master here in this particular way of doing it which is just our goal is to both steward the [6583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6583.599s)

information commons and to get that to become a recognized thing where it becomes decentrally stewarded by lots of different groups and kind of as a cultural value and then to not have any other reason to exist okay i mean that's fair but there's some master to that money as well when people donate they can try and have [6602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6602.639s)

strings attached and this is where great founder hypothesis is important um apple post jobs isn't the same and musk industries post musk is probably not going to be the same and so institutional decay oftentimes starts to occur when the founder that was the or the founding group that was motivated by the thing is gone and they [6625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6625.36s)

didn't pass on that process that [[generator function]] of the wisdom well enough so you get generational decay this project is not going to last long enough for that to matter here the generational decay issue is a real issue but um as a founding team focused here we've had times where people wanted to give money with strings attached we just [6647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6647.28s)

told them to  __  themselves and because we know what we're actually committed for yeah and the same is true with people who would work in the organization if they can you know have this is why like also no names associated is there isn't there is there's actually okay the nobility part i like that there's [6666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6666.0s)

actually a noble imperative that is deeper than the capital imperative and it can be tapped into earnestly now it's been manipulated so much you have a group of cynical a whole kind of cynical population where all there was no experience of real virtue only virtue signaling but real virtue is [6683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6683.76s)

actually a thing and the ennoblement here is the idea that everyone could be possibly a meaningful decision maker and contributor to society and they all we want them all to have access to the best information anyone has access to there's an ennoblement of what we think about the value of the mind and that this is a key thing [6703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6703.199s)

not only do i not want to manipulate what someone does who they vote for or what they believe on something i want to give them better ability to make sense of it i want to inoculate them against anyone being able to manipulate them effectively moving forward right we want to help them increase their sovereignty [6721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6721.599s)

and increase their communication with other people so that [[collective intelligence]] individual [[collective intelligence]] is actually a thing that's the actual thing that we believe in as a basis for change across lots of different vectors yeah well i mean i love the spirit of it and and i you know i and i mean this sincerely i [6738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6738.4s)

mean this very sincerely i don't fully understand that but i want to and i i respect what you're saying i really do i'm not i'm not trying to be cute at all and part of it is because of my own experience in the four versus not-for-profit realm and then just sort of the battle of [6758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6758.4s)

ideas because it just you know in essence it just becomes you know i've seen the mo some of the most competitive people i've ever seen in my life are people running not-for-profits who make you know decisions based on personal foibles and things in ways that are just so destructive you know and then there's also this just this kind of um [6777](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6777.599s)

there can be this sort of elitist view that permeates the place based on other things and we don't need to talk about that right now but i'm saying this because i care and i think these are reasonable and good considerations and we went over hundreds of them you know internally like [6799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6799.599s)

possible strategic considerations with a very good advisory group and we'll continue to and will pivot strategically to what serves best as we really learn what serves best the clarity of what the actual mission and vision is is clear is how do we actually support an increasing integrity in the information and [[epistemic commons]] and how do we increase a shared cultural value towards not just group virtue signaling and outrage and whatever but high quality [[sensemaking]] and high good faith dialogue as the prerequisites of our ability to do any of the problem solving that we really care about and uh you know these the kind of conversations about these things [6842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6842.719s)

uh would be happy to have them on or offline at some point yeah i think there's also probably some very powerful synergies here between tom your extraordinary ability to tell stories and to grab people's attention without limitlessly hijacking them and and and what you're trying to build your daniel um i [6863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6863.28s)

uh i certainly got a whole lot more than i expected out of this conversation it's gonna be fascinating to see how we edit this if at all but um and there's there's a question tons of questions i didn't even get to use maybe we can do it again neil i want i want to talk about well there's a lot of i want to talk about either on camera off and and i [6882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6882.639s)

let me say too that i would love to tell this story this story it was a great that was a great treatment right there really it was a great treatment for a film and you could tell this story and about i'm making this up 19 minutes literally in a really useful form and i think it would just i would love [6900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6900.719s)

to hear your thoughts and get your help on telling the story yeah it's a great great story and i love i love you know the i mean in the in the world of information overload prioritization just becomes so much more critical and if we can find that place which in the end will include nobility will include it's [6921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6921.04s)

going to it's going it it it it's dead on arrival if it doesn't have the energy to carry through and if you leave those pieces out of this puzzle i'm sorry man it's just it's the way the world works these days it's like constantly tearing things apart and if it doesn't have that integrity that holds it together [6939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6939.76s)

you know other than you know to be a new addiction because if you're making a new addiction you could probably ride that train for quite a while but if you're trying to do something different it requires it has to carry some elements that are really powerful i want to say one thing about addiction it's the last thing i'll say so in the present you know and [6958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6958.159s)

we evolutionarily uh evolved to have high dopamine response to salt sugar and fat because in our [[evolutionary environment]] there were many of those things we developed the ability to make lots of those things combine them very effectively fast food obesity we know that thing it's actually very hard if kids are being exposed to that [6977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6977.199s)

to not go down that path you know especially when they're young they don't have good um discipline develop whatever it is not true that in the presence of those 100 of everyone is obese there is a way to develop uh discipline and good habits even in the presence of those things and to get positive feedback on health and vitality [6997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=6997.04s)

rather than the positive feedback in an addiction direction we see people who it's not addiction but have a strong positive feedback loop around fitness and health and things like that it's not enough of the population but there is a thing there where discipline is actually trained and required to move in a [7015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7015.599s)

direction other than the near-term hit [[hypernormal stimuli]] direction the same is true cognitively emotionally socially and um we can train people to have discipline around not just taking the [[hypernormal stimuli]] hits and being able to do better [[sensemaking]] and the importance of that and the people who do will do better [7039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7039.44s)

they will understand the world better navigate it better and the groups of them that converse better will have more [[collective intelligence]] we'll problem solve better and become a strange attractor and one other thing i'll mention is that [[hypernormal stimuli]] whether it's dating apps or porn or [[social media]] or fast food what they were to the actual [7058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7058.08s)

evolutionary thing [[hypernormal stimuli]] is something we're way more susceptible to because we live in a hyponormal environment meaning the kinds of stimuli that we evolved to have we're actually missing we're not we're not in a tribe of you know 50 to 150 people that we're interacting with socially very well gabor mate's work and other people in [7077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7077.92s)

attachment theory have shown that loneliness is the main predictor of addiction and we are not physical as much and so there are kinds of stimuli that are healthy evolutionary stimuli that our world has made less of and that hyponormal environment makes us susceptible to hypernormal [7094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7094.32s)

which is why so many people who are checking their phone all the time go to a festival with a bunch of friends and notice they aren't checking their phone at all um because they're actually actively engaged in something that is meaningful and rich and whatever so one of the dynamics here will be the development of the awareness and the [7111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7111.679s)

discipline then the effectiveness of that that catches on one of the other dynamics will be social reinforcement dynamics of people actually having more meaningful engagement with each other and the positive feedback loop-like exercise has of epiphany a better understanding and then more capacity to [7128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7128.08s)

navigate and sovereignty as what the race to the top as opposed to [[race to the bottom]] is so daniel schmoktenberger is the greatest outlier of the thesis of tnp of anyone i've ever met i'm not kidding i'm not kidding like what you were just talking about there's you know judd brewer i don't know judd brewer but [7146](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7146.96s)

um he does a really nice job of outlining those practices and and its relationship to mindfulness for example um you know our our thing is a lot about the battle against the isolation emergency that's the term we use um and and it carries with it so many of those attributes that you talk about [7165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7165.84s)

i mean it's very interesting because it truly is and you were referring to it earlier rp like it's a competitive advantage in modern times in ways that it just it's never been like not like not on this level because if you live in a state of like that constant you know micro anxiety those people who actually have some kind of clarity [7186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_wPQCU5O6w&t=7186.32s)

man you know they get you know what a gift that they have anyway this has been great i've enjoyed it i would be happy to come on and do another talk at some another dialogue at some point
