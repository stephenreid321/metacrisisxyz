music times all right everyone welcome to the store uh our friend uh daniel schmuckenberger is here uh he's gonna do uh we're having a session on the something called the health index and i'll let daniel explain that in a moment um yeah daniel and i were chatting on things for him to do at the stoa and he proposed this one and one on um the pitfalls of uh kind of engaging in x-risk which i think is next week or the week after and i'm quite excited about that one as well um so how today is going to work we're here for for 60 minutes but we might go over uh 75 minutes and um daniel's going to share his thoughts and [54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=54.64s)

then we'll have a conversation at the stoa so if you have any questions throw them in the chat i'll call you and mute yourself if you don't want to be on youtube i just indicate that because this will be on youtube um so that being said daniel welcome back to the store my friend peter it's good to be here with you [74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=74.08s)

thank you it's good to see everybody shall we just dive right in yeah did you want me to prompt you with uh the question or um um either way we can just dive right in i just hand this though to you when you're here so i'm happy to do whatever you like thanks man um yeah this is uh there's a topic that i've been thinking [103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=103.36s)

about that i thought would be interesting to share this definitely was the environment i wanted to share it because it's very much at the intersection of personal development relational development and societal betterment and it's also a topic i haven't talked about publicly before so it's just kind of [124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=124.24s)

uh exploring a thought experiment together it seemed like a good place to do it um and we're introducing it as if we were going to think of a better metric than gdp or whatever the other proposed metrics are for the health of a society or civilization it's a very deep question actually to [144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=144.72s)

say what is a healthy civilization there's environmental metrics there's happiness metrics there's health metrics there's progress metrics there's educational metrics to really answer what is a healthy good civilization you have to answer what is a meaningful human life and what is meaningful human life in total and how is the civilization actually [162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=162.4s)

fulfilling on that so the metric of success and the existential values are very related and i think everybody knows that optimizing for something like gdp is not a very good success metric because gdp goes up when there's war in military contracting goes up it goes up when addiction goes up and people spend more money on [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=185.28s)

getting their supply uh when people are more sick and spend money on health care gdp goes up so there's a lot of places where gdp can go up that are maybe good for the supply side and really bad for civilization as a whole and um there are a lot of alternative indices where we maybe look at genie coefficients and [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=206.319s)

national happiness and diseases and all of them have some good consideration and then are also missing some stuff if i tried to make some way of uh optimizing for happiness are we defining happiness in a kind of buddhist sense that is very disconnected from the nature of desire and is more like [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=229.28s)

contentment or happiness in more of a western sense that has more to do with kind of a creative passion those are very different and what about optimizing for the happiness of sadists um or what about the short-term happiness that comes from addiction and so you can start to kind of think about when you're benefiting one value [252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=252.0s)

what are other values that can be harmed and there's this important insight that almost everything that values lives in a dialectical almost everything that is worth valuing lives in a dialectical relationship with what seems like a nearly opposing but it's really a complementary value and so there's some kind of balance as the beginning way of thinking [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=273.84s)

about it but higher order synthesis is kind of a better way of thinking about it between the values individualism uh by itself run amok looks like uh social chaos and low coordination and coherence collectivism run amok looks like oppression civilizations fail on both sides and so [295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=295.52s)

of course we have these age-old political debates about communism versus capitalism libertarianism versus socialism the political left and political right that are taking values that obviously have to be in relationship with each other forever and instead of saying how do we best create a dialectical synthesis between individualism and collectivism we have it fight as if one of them could possibly win which is nonsense and so when we're thinking about success metrics we have to think about whatever thing we value what also has to be held in dialectic relationship with that and that's on one axis then there's lots of axes right i would say that for everybody who's kind of thinking about how do we design a better future if you do your own experiment your own thought experiment of what are some indices that i think might be good indices for a healthy civilization if we were [347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=347.039s)

going to optimize for anything what would it be like do that as a thought experiment because it's uh meaningful and you kind of mine your own sense of what is the good life what is meaningful what is a good civilization then you have to think about where would optimizing for that metric actually [363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=363.12s)

create problems what are the failure modes where is that thing even though it's valuable not sufficient and what might we have to add and then you get to start thinking about the interconnectivity of things and there are um there's a lot of classic dialectics individual collective is one uh immediate term and long term is [384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=384.319s)

another one right do we want to optimize for the rate of progress even if it is through creative discontent where everybody's miserable now but there's lots of progress happening or do we want to optimize for the state of the quality of life now even if it maybe has very low progress uh well obviously there's a relationship [403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=403.28s)

between how do we have progress towards dissatisfaction forever is not that interesting uh a kind of content that creates stasis rather than evolution is not that interesting is there a higher order synthesis where the fulfillment with life leads us to want to add to it creatively um so oftentimes thinking about the [423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=423.919s)

relationship between those things gives you a higher order insight oh my my progress doesn't have to come from discontent it can actually come from a sense of the fullness and beauty of life that i want to add to and now all of a sudden the progress metric and the near-term metric don't seem like they're opposed at all [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=443.199s)

one of the nice things about thinking of synthesis is you end up realizing that things that seem dichotomous are sometimes actually better optimized together than more synergistic one metric i have proposed that is an interesting one to think about for the health of a society and some other points is [463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=463.039s)

an inverse correlation with addiction in the society the more total types of behaviors people have addictive relationships with the more consequentiality those addictions have on their life the more intensity the further the distribution the earlier they start in life uh the aggregate of all that [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=485.68s)

would be a hard thing to measure would be an inverse correlation to the health of a society because it's an inverse correlation to the health of the individual psychological physical relational health the person the person experiencing compulsion rather than choice in ways that harm themselves that they wish they [507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=507.599s)

didn't uh obviously the movement into more sense of freedom and agency to make the choices that are aligned with the life we want is correlated with quality of life so these are just examples of indices that are maybe not ones you automatically uh think about or hear often but that [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=526.64s)

are kind of interesting so there's one in particular i wanted to construct today and we honestly could have talked about it as just an interesting model not as a societal index and we could have talked about it as a way of measuring the health of a relationship or the health of a community or the psychological health of a person it's kind of fractally true at these various levels i'll make a caveat and say i don't think any definable metric should be optimized um i think i wrote a piece a little while ago maybe we can put in the link here when it goes onto youtube called [571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=571.12s)

the dance of the dow and the 10 000 things and it's specifically about this but the first verse of the tao te ching where it says the uh dao that is knowable is not the eternal dao right the knowledge that's noble is not the eternal doll it not the knowledge the doubt that is speakable is not the eternal doubt [589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=589.6s)

then the dow that is optimizable is not the eternal dial optimization means that i can define it in terms of a fixed number of metrics and then i can run some weighted optimization algorithm across those metrics and we can see just like gdp ends up being good for some things but quite perverse for other things so then i can try to add some other [614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=614.959s)

metric to it we can see that any metric set if i optimize for it there's some things that are valuable that are outside of that metric set that end up being harmed by how i optimize for those things and there's kind of a girdles incompleteness theorem here in the same way that there's a a kind of fundamental infinity to math there's a [636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=636.72s)

kind of fundamental infinity to what is meaningful where any finite definition of it ends up being less than it actually is and so i would almost say a definition of wisdom one interesting definition of wisdom is the difference between what an ai running an optimization function on a [662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=662.32s)

fixed number of desirable metrics comes up with as the right choice the delta between that and what the actual right choice is would be wisdom which means that it has to include that it includes rationality in the consideration of all those metrics but it's not limited to it the includes and transcends the [682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=682.64s)

transcends that part which is able to factor something outside of the existing metric set it's able to recognize it that's something like discernment and wisdom that matters and if anything that's another way of saying what if we could optimize for something we would optimize for that [700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=700.0s)

that's another metric at the level of civilization so the reason i bring this up is to say this this model i'm about to propose i wouldn't optimize for because it's missing stuff so it i'm not offering it as a complete thing i'm offering it as an interesting enough thing that it's worth thinking about as [719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=719.44s)

one of the central things and we can talk after we constructed about what it's missing okay so without uh further ado on the model so people have heard here probably of mirror neurons this uh kind of sympathetic effect where uh there's a pretty automatic [745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=745.839s)

reaction that happens for most people where they feel some kind of sympathetic experience with other people something they feel some element of what they would experience if they're experiencing this a thing themselves watching someone else go through it so you can flinch if you see somebody else [763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=763.76s)

getting hit you can start laughing if you see somebody else laughing so there is a coupling between our emotional state and the emotional state of someone else in this case and so we can feel happiness associated with their happiness we can feel pain associated with their pain i would say there's a whole bunch of [780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=780.8s)

questions about mirror neurons and rather than say rather than really tie it to the neuroscience of mirror neurons that is still evolving and is probably wrong whatever i would say about it i'm going to use it as an analogy more than a mechanistic description um it's it's [798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=798.839s)

probably the case that that process mediated by mirror neurons or whatever evolved largely as to serve group selection that humans were a necessarily tribal species a group species where individual sapiens don't do well on the savannah they don't do well at all right like they they don't make it outside of being in a group so the cohesiveness of the group is how they succeed in hunting and protecting themselves and all those things so we over focus generally on individual selection what makes who's the alpha and what makes the the person individual [841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=841.279s)

and we do that because we've created a world today where we don't recognize who the tribe is because everyone is fungible i can get everything that i need from this abstract thing called the market and i can put something into the market to be able to get the dollars to get what i need which was largely a way of abstracting [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=857.36s)

relationships to make it seem like we don't need each other but obviously our life depends upon other people we've just tried to make it pretty distant this is also though why there's ubiquitous loneliness and mental illness and a basis for so much addiction is because the addiction is trying to fill a void that [874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=874.88s)

was largely because of being tribal people and so for a tribe to function well it's not based on a huge amount of in-group rivalry uh it's based on a huge amount of in-group cooperation the in-group cooperation is facilitated by this mere neuron kind of phenomena of if i'm hurting when you're hurting then [893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=893.36s)

i'm not going to hurt you right which means that as a tribe i can trust you more and we're going to get along you can trust me more we're going to get along better if i feel good when you feel good then i'm more invested in helping you out you're more invested in helping me out we get higher cooperation and higher cooperation ends [908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=908.639s)

up being pretty central to the thing we think of as the unique advantage of sapiens right our language and our division of labor and whatever are kind of higher orders of cooperation and so our emotional coupling with each other helps that now we can see that people will have this within in group [930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=930.72s)

and have the opposite of it with an out group right so we feel pain when somebody in our in group that we love is feeling pain we call that compassion or empathy or sympathy or something like that but sometimes we even feel joy when someone in the out group [946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=946.72s)

out group feels pain like uh and as a form of vengeance or a kind of joy and a sense of justice or rivalry or whatever it is um and so we can see that we can have mere neuron type relationships right we can have positive coupling of our emotions and other emotions and that facilitates anti-rivalrous or cooperative behavior [969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=969.92s)

we can also have decoupled or even anti-coupled emotional responses which leads to rivalrous behavior so if people are familiar with uh stuff that i talk about the movement from rivalries to anti-[[rivalrous dynamics]] being not just important but necessary under [[exponential tech]] is one of the things i talk about a lot because leads to tribal warfare and conflict and things like that right conflict of various kinds obviously when we move from stone tools to bronze age tools and then to iron age tools that conflict gets capable of killing more people at bigger distances when it moves to an [[exponential tech]] mediated world you can't run exponential conflict on a finite planet and keep running the planet the damage scope of the conflict it's too large so anti-rivalry or bust is pretty fundamental you don't get to run exponential rivalry so thinking about this thing who should be the in group who should be [1031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1031.28s)

the out group well if everybody has access to [[exponential tech]] and any in-group uses force against them it drives an [[arms race]] where they then figure out how to reverse engineer that tech make it stronger use it back against you as long as we keep doing in-group out group dynamics at any level left right in the u.s us china whatever [1048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1048.96s)

we are on a path towards self-induced extinction so we have to find a way of having a coordinating basis that doesn't require an out group as the thing we're creating an in-group with respect to so if we didn't out group could we have that tribal mirror neuron kind of thing with [1068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1068.88s)

everybody right could we actually have a positive coupling of our emotions with everyone so i want to construct the core of this thing is we'll describe like four words or four things there's this axis a pain pleasure happiness unhappiness axis inside of people and we were [1086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1086.4s)

describing that it can be positively coupled with somebody else so the so if you're feeling some kind of pain or negative emotion i'm feeling something that's painful in response uh it means i give a right like i have some investedness or connection or skin in the game to your experience so we would call that sympathy or empathy [1109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1109.28s)

or compassion on the positive side if you're if you're doing well if you're succeeding if you're progressing if things are going well for you in life and i feel happy for you that thing that we think of as empathetic joy it's important to acknowledge that we don't have a word for that in english [1127](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1127.6s)

like it we make words for concepts that we use the idea of feeling joy at the joy of others it's it's actually a core precept in buddhism mudita is a sanskrit term for empathetic joy feeling delight at the delight of others it's considered of the the four virtues to cultivate the [1151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1151.28s)

kind of subtlest and highest of all the virtues and we don't have a word for it in english um because it's a phenomena that we don't even think about or focus on enough to make a word for it the polyamory community had to make up a fake word and it's kim persian and [1171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1171.44s)

uh so the term compersion they they held being the kind of opposite of jealousy and specifically in a sharing intimate partners which was the common opportunity to feel jealousy actually feeling happy for the happiness of others even when it involved romance because it kind of got popularized there i think the [1192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1192.08s)

term came about in the 70s it has been extended or we can propose extending it because english has no other word for compersion not being unique to a romantic context but in general feeling happiness of the happiness of others feeling joy at their success to lighten their delight so i'm going to use conversion that way and it's expanded [1209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1209.36s)

definition so we have one axis that is the compassion compersion access and the compassion conversion access as i my emotional state is coupled with your emotional state i want to see you doing well i feel better when you're doing well i don't want to see you doing poorly i feel something painful that doesn't have to [1232](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1232.559s)

mean codependent that i'm totally up if you're feeling poorly because that's not helpful and then i can't help but i feel something that's resonant okay so the compassion compersion axis that's if our emotional states are coupled if they're completely uncoupled there's no relationship at all whether you're suffering or happy makes [1253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1253.52s)

no difference to me my suffering or happiness has nothing to do with yours that's maybe what we would think of as sociopathy just a complete decoupling and so you can be totally suffering and i can be totally joyful if i happen to be joyful about it in this case i don't want you to feel suffering i just don't care what you feel right [1274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1274.64s)

it's just a state of ab of apathy of not giving a and as a result i don't want to hurt you but i'm happy to hurt you if that gets me something i want but hurting you would be not the terminal end in and of itself it would be a means to some other end that i care about that's the uncoupled state and we can see that it [1293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1293.679s)

is quite destructive we can also see that unfortunately most people feel that way about most other people music there's a lot of people in the world suffering today and you don't give a  about it because you don't know um or they just had the greatest success of their life and you don't give a about it so [1310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1310.4s)

you notice that the buddhists because of this idea of modita are cultivating compassion and compulsion mudita right for all sentient beings in the universe how do i bind myself with the self of all sentient beings and that is really thinking about them wow some kids are in sex slavery right now some [1329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1329.52s)

animals are in factory farms some like how do i think about the greater world how do i bind myself to it and it's from there that the valve the bodhisattva arises how do i become of greatest use to all sentient beings not just myself because myself what is best for me and what's best for all sentient beings is the same when i bind myself to all of [1349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1349.44s)

them um in the same way that what's best for me and what's best for the tribe evolutionarily is the same we just extend the tribe to all sentient beings because the sanskrit saying the world is my family right it's that kind of idea okay so now what about anti-coupling reverse coupling my positive emotions are coupled to your [1370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1370.559s)

negative emotions my my negative emotions are couple year positive ones me having negative emotions coupled to your positive ones is what we would think of as jealousy or envy or negative comparison or any of those types of things like if you're doing well ah that guy man you know like i'm [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1389.919s)

actually feeling jealousy or i'm feeling envy i feel something negative at your success or at your happiness we think of this as quite normal in our society because we have conditioned it based on a society where second place is the first loser and um everything is based on competition on [1414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1414.96s)

the same finite metrics and uh from the time of you know little kids we're conditioning them to rally for a sports team where we're super happy when these guys win and give no shits at all in fact feel feel happy about the other guys losing and we could just as easily be rooting for the other team we're training ourselves to be able to couple to a [1434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1434.32s)

tribe an anti-couple to another tribe emotionally which is really good for supporting warfare um and but it's important to understand that this jealousy envy thing is of course natural to humans but it's not inexorable to humans meaning it's not something that we're just stuck with no matter [1454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1454.0s)

what it there's a natural proclivity to be able to condition that but it gets conditioned and it's also possible to have cultures that condition something very else very different so when you look at the mosswa people indigenous group in china near lulu lake if you look at the canela people in the amazon you see people that have pretty much no [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1472.72s)

jealousy almost no jealousy show up in their culture and when it does happen it's a tiny phenomena that someone just kind of recognizes and corrects for would be shameful for it to be anything else but they have a whole culture that's conditioning a different set of things now you'll notice [1490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1490.799s)

these cultures don't have private ownership of property like lots of tribal cultures don't they're all sharing everything well that means that they don't have a primary concept of mine related to private property what does jealousy mean if i don't have mine as a foundational concept [1505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1505.52s)

right if there's ours as a foundational concept we we're all sharing our resources as a tribe and sharing access to things but you see that we condition mine into little kids the reason it's a such it's almost like one of the first words many little kids say because they were watching their parents and everybody on tv say it because of a [1526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1526.24s)

mindset that was so oriented around possession and possessiveness and advancing through getting more things so we think of it as natural because it's been ubiquitously conditioned here's where i would offer uh krishnamurti's famous quote that it is not a good measure of mental health to be well adjusted to a profoundly [1546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1546.08s)

insane society so most of us are pretty comfortable with the idea that the people who were feeling like who were celebrating and rejoicing at the uh lynching of slaves as a form of entertainment like they were up they're psychologically up people but [1567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1567.2s)

they were everybody in a culture at a time they didn't think of themselves as psychologically up so we're like is it possible for a whole culture to have a shared psychopathology and not realize it yeah totally and what about the great joy that happened in human sacrifice in many ancient [1585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1585.679s)

cultures and the idea that some good great liberating thing happened with that human sacrifice what about the vast burning of witches which were moms which were women being burned like tortured but there is a a righteous glee in that process okay so we're pretty comfortable with [1604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1604.88s)

the idea or nazism which is like there are plenty of people who are alive today who remember that we're comfortable with the idea that it's possible for an entire culture to be insane like have a completely batshit crazy set of ideas about things and where there's something like a [1626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1626.559s)

mental illness across the whole population and not just insane but criminally insane right the burning of which is the lynching is a fun form of entertainment the throwing of christians to lions is a good sunday activity for the family that like that's a criminal insanity but it's also just called culture and [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1645.84s)

so it's important to understand we will enculturate insanity where it seems normal i would claim that ubiquitous jealousy of the type that we have in our culture is a is a type of low-grade sub-clinical ubiquitous psychopathology and specifically it's important to understand that it is the inverse coupling of my emotional state with [1668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1668.88s)

other people's binding us to a rivalrous relationship with each other now the other side of this axis of reverse coupling right the jealousy envy one is i feel some pain some pinch some negativity at their joy their when their success the other side is i feel some joy at their pain this [1686](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1686.48s)

is sadism uh the german term shouden freud is you know feel experiencing joy at the misery of others sadism particularly is experiencing joy at the misery of others particularly when you have something to do with it um but we can i think most people are comfortable with the idea that of all of the um emotional dispositions humans can inhabit sadism is uh the the one that is most problematic right it's the one that is most kind of bound to what we might think of as evil you mean the person well they just didn't know they were causing harm no they did well they felt that they had to cause [1734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1734.559s)

harm no causing the harm was a terminal in and of itself they weren't doing it for some other reason they just enjoy it i don't know a better way to define evil than that right like that's that's pretty up so it's important to understand that sadism is the other side of the same axis as jealousy they're the same access right the [1752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1752.48s)

reverse coupling of my emotional state and yours so i would say that this whole axis which we can define as the rivalry axis right i see i have an immersed emotional relationship because i see you as fundamentally an enemy fundamentally another a bad guy or whatever so i feel good at you getting [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1773.36s)

hurt you losing you doing less well etc i feel bad at you getting ahead in any way and you can see that in a tribal warfare conflict maybe there was an evolutionary purpose for this if there really was scarce food and we had tribal war over it and i see that you actually got some more weapons and some more pigs and whatever [1791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1791.679s)

i feel scared and i feel bad because it was actually maybe going to go bad for us and so we understand why people do in-group identification and out-grouping and out-grouping makes it to where i can call somebody a jew and then be happy gassing children in the millions right um because they're a jew and they're so [1813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1813.279s)

other and we make them bad or i can call him a terrorist or i can call him a a racist or a whatever right and um if you if you look in current culture at how the left and right use outgrouping terms on each other even just republican or democrat is an out-grouping term that has so much negative connotation to the other side [1837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1837.36s)

but conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxer flat earth or whatever um comey socialist anti-patriot uh that just has to stop right that that tribal dynamic multiplied by [[exponential tech]] is a [[self-terminating]] thing but you'll notice that there's a kind of righteous joy that people feel on both sides [1862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1862.48s)

when they feel like they're winning and the other side is losing and they're sticking it to the other side right and but the joy feels righteous it actually feels moral and but so did the people burning the witches in the name of jesus right and somehow in their mind they got that in the name of christianity and the [1885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1885.919s)

following of christ and the guy who said let he who has no sins amongst you cast the first stone and emphasize forgiveness we're going to torture these people to death somehow they twisted the in their mind to have that make sense where it actually felt moral and righteous steady gerard if you haven't studied gerard before [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1903.76s)

in terms of [[conflict theory]] and scapegoating one particular form of out grouping is uh scapegoating in particular we have to transcend that gerardian thing so what i would say is you've got this compassion compersion axis and you've got this sadism jealousy axis and i would say that feeling joy at the joy of others is a fundamentally healthier kind of joy to optimize for than just personal joy because personal joy might be sadism and it might be sociopathic right it might mean that my joy is totally decoupled from yours it might mean that my joy is actually at your expense if it's on the compulsive side it means [1951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1951.36s)

my desire to feel more joy requires helping other people and if their desire to feel more joy requires helping other people now there's this anti-rivalrous symbiotic cooperative development so compersion is a subset of joy or happiness that is one that has the highest synergy and internalization of externalities and [1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1973.36s)

health that's associated but i wouldn't want compersion without compassion because i wouldn't want someone who were just um spiritual bypassing happiness junkies who were just only like oh i'm happy at your happiness you're sad i need to move away from you and find someone else who's happy um i want people who can [1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=1992.32s)

be with feeling compassionate the pain of others and move by it and go help right if if compersion is the only thing i want to feel i don't want to be mother teresa i don't want to go be with homeless people or sick people or whatever but if i'm if i'm moved by this axis right if someone's hurting i don't want to not be hurting i don't [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2012.159s)

want to not like when i'm feeling pain at the pain of the world i don't feel bad about the pain i'm feeling i feel like i would be mentally ill if i wasn't feeling it so even though there is some pain at seeing the pain of the world there's no inner conflict around it so there's peace in it [2028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2028.64s)

right deeper than happiness is wholeness and the sense that like if someone i really love dies i don't want to be feeling ecstatic in that moment like something's wrong with me like i want to be feeling a certain grief and there's a beauty in the grief because there was someone that was so  beautiful that i got to know at all right so there is a happiness there is a beauty there's a gratitude and there's a loss there's reality and when i'm feeling that it feels right it feels like the only thing that i should feel there's no inner conflict so so we want happiness but not as the only emotion we want all all of the emotions when they're [2066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2066.0s)

appropriate right they all have a appropriate function so here's my index that i would offer how do we measure compersion well it's very hard so i'm offering this as a thought experiment how do we measure compassion very hard how do we measure sadism and jealousy so let's not deal with how we measure them for a moment let's just say [2086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2086.0s)

we could the in a society the total amount of activity on the compassion compersion axis divided by the total amount of activity on the sadism jealousy axis would be the index of the health of the society the more of this one and the less of this one right a ratio of the total amount of human activity [2108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2108.88s)

and human emotion on this axis versus this axis emotionally coupled versus emotionally anti-coupled and given that we want to not be doing the in-grouping out grouping thing because we have global effects and we can't just kind of be peaceful with our own in-group we have we depend upon people in six continents [2129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2129.44s)

because of our complex [[supply chain|supply chains]] to make the stuff this really has to become rather than just an in-group metric a civilization-wide metric i would say though if you look at your own relationships uh and you you look at this metric it's a pretty good measurement of the health of your relationships if you were to look at a community of people the degree to which the people are in kind of jealous envy competition with each other not so not so good um the degree the degree to which they can't be with the pain of each other each other not so good so obviously to be with the pain of each other has to [2174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2174.56s)

have not just a positive wiring which is the compassion but has to have enough strength and emotional resilience that i can be with the emotion right so we can see that to fulfill on these emotions requires a bunch of other things to be in place to not be jealous of somebody else requires enough inner fulfillment that i'm not so desperate that i feel [2193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2193.28s)

like i need the thing they have right um and so you can see that to be able to fulfill on these there's other foundational stuff like strength and wholeness of being i the first book i ever read that got me started thinking about these things really clearly was when i was a teenager a book called the way to love by anthony demello i [2217](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2217.599s)

don't know if i've recommended that one here before uh i love anthony demelo so much he's a jesuit priest but he lived in india and liked hindu philosophy liked all the religious philosophies i think him continuing to be a jesuit was just like a respect and appreciation for a tradition he came from [2244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2244.24s)

um but uh it's a small little book of meditations and they're they're basically all about how to cultivate a kind of wholeness that creates more of an unconditional happiness that allows you to be more virtuous applause because if my happiness is unconditional [2262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2262.96s)

if my happiness is very conditional and my sense of peace is very conditional then i have to be trying to rearrange the conditions of the world and trying to rearrange your behavior and everything else to fit meeting that hungry ghost inside of me if i find a certain fulfillment in my relationship with life with breath with the trees [2285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2285.2s)

then what's in it for me stops being the primary driver and i can actually be attentive to other things so rather than happiness being the goal of life i would say kind of an unconditional type of happiness or an unconditional type of peace is the beginning of life that is really worth living where you aren't being run by what the [2301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2301.68s)

buddhists call the hungry ghost realm of what's in it for me is the primary driver and that's when you can start paying attention to how interesting other people's experiences and how much is going on in the world and not just how what does everything mean for me which is a dreadful narcissistic hall of mirrors [2320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2320.48s)

um and so the work to develop that wholeness as the basis of being able to see the world and be with it and live while you're here is fundamental so i recommend the dimelo book um and yeah that's the thing that's the metric i wanted to propose the compassion compersion divided by the jealousy sadism ratio and now of course why does that metric fail i could have people that really care and really give a and are so bad at rationality that they keep making the objectively wrong choice so if i was to amend this metric with something the first thing i would amend it with [2373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2373.68s)

is i would multiply this metric by the rational and empirical quality of choice making but see then the rational choice would be a tool of utilitarian awareness in service to what was being defined by this metric right which would be my desire for the happiness of all beings would then be the thing i was using [2398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2398.4s)

rationality to optimize the other thing is of course if if i have this for an in-group and not now group i can still be say this to the out group and run [[arms race|arms races]] the out group has when they say we have to have no out groups that has to include other species and so if we want to uh extend this further have the mirror neuron thing not [2422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2422.96s)

just be limited to sapiens but all sentient beings so if we say this thing the compassion conversion axis is what we want to be on as much as we can and as little on this other axis and empower that with good rationality and empiricism of what's really working and extend it to [2444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2444.319s)

all sentient beings i i think that's a pretty solid metric for us to optimize for and that's it that's the thing i thought might be interesting and i wanted to share and oh one other thing okay so that sounds nice now this is a new thing that we can pretend is true for us when it's not true and [2466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2466.96s)

create a shadow around okay so i'm going to pretend to be compassionate even though i'm actually feeling some sheldon freud uh when somebody else is hurting because i was told this was a good virtue and people like good virtue so i'm going to pretend to be this way because really i'm just trying to get other people to like me because i'm still [2485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2485.68s)

basically in the empty what's in it for me place and other people liking me because they think i'm a virtuous person is what's motivating my behavior all right as long as you have the empty hungry ghost realm what's in it for me thing running you you can't run do virtue you just can't you can only run the simulation of it [2503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2503.52s)

um so what does it take to overcome that this is this is why i like that de mello book so much it's why i like the buddhist practices and ultimately do i really even hold the virtue do i hold the value where really i'm developing it because i care about it but it whether anybody else ever knows [2525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2525.68s)

about it or not like i care about it my own sense of inner integrity and respect of myself matters or am i happy to virtue signal this thing because really what's driving me is the childhood insecurity and feeling of i'm not enough and nothing's enough and i need to compensate by having other [2545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2545.839s)

people love me and like me and praise me and whatever so i will do virtue just like i might do money or or sexiness or humor or whatever it is as a compensation method for being able to get some kind of something from other people in the world so [2562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2562.16s)

so there's a question of like okay so we just defined a virtue worth holding but now how does one congruently develop the virtue versus just jump straight to the performative behavior of the virtue you think about it enough to think about how miserable a life any other way is that you become so disgusted with your own behavior of that type [2584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2584.64s)

that you have to stop it and you become so inspired and heartened and motivated by the beauty of the other thing that you're inspired to work at it and and you have an internal congruency between what you actually believe and what you're willing to train yourself and base your life on and then you know [2607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2607.2s)

that the other thing is still conditioned in you and pretending it's not there doesn't help so okay i feel jealousy well sometimes when i it's time to work out i feel lazy i don't have to pretend that i never feel lazy i don't have to super shame myself for it [2631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2631.68s)

but i also don't not work out right like it's okay so i'm feeling lazy that's okay i accept that the feelings are rising and i'm gonna go get some caffeine and i'm gonna go to the gym and it's like i can notice it and i can still choose a higher path rather than choose that path right because [2649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2649.599s)

as you have low energy you don't choose to do the things that generate more energy and there's a downward cycle so if instead you choose to do the thing that takes energy but generates energy there's an upward cycle this is kind of like the essence of being able to notice something and then make a higher choice [2667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2667.04s)

maybe maybe i'm feeling some sadism maybe i'm feeling like an actual kind of someone pissed me off so much i'm like have a vengeance sense if i pretend that i don't and i try to stuff that away it'll come out when i get upset enough right and i'll blow up and i'll be a not safe person or it'll eek out in subtle ways where i'll subtly undermine people [2687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2687.44s)

um so i have to look at all that so i'm a big fan of therapy by the way good therapy i'm not i'm not a big fan of types of therapy that aren't effective but i've done something like a thousand therapy sessions in my life uh started young kind of did it intensely [2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2710.079s)

fisher hoffman work gestalt work jungian work ret primal scream rebirthing whatever name all things because um in the same way of doing a lot of meditation a lot of study it's like meditation works on a level of self different types of meditations do different things but maybe i'm developing my ability [2731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2731.04s)

to concentrate to quiet the mind that doesn't mean that the thoughts that when they do arise in the mind are healthier that's in the domain of psychology of how do i work through where the thought patterns arise from and what the patterns of thought are and neither of those give me the benefit of studying or i'm learning new skills so these are different dimensions of the [2751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2751.28s)

self that are all worth working on because you not just are happier but you are also more capable of showing up more meaningfully so if anybody has a stigma around therapy where it's like that's for up people let that go it's you invest in what you care about and if you care about having the clearest psyche you can so [2768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2768.8s)

you can be the most whole vessel for service to the world and invest in it um and you can do it on your own you can read demelo get the principles and then get a process like byron katie's the work and kind of work on on your own that's great there's lots of processes like that but having help with it also like okay hey [2791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2791.119s)

i have a lot of jealousy that's a thing that's in there because it's not the thing i respect i want to work to shift it but i'm not going to have the i'm going to have the type of shame around it that says i don't want to indulge it but i'm not going to have the type of shame that makes me pretend it isn't there so i can't work on it because i ultimately recognize i didn't [2810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2810.88s)

program it in myself right had i been raised in a buddhist culture i would be different um so i don't really have any shame in the fact that it was programmed but i also have have a value system that it doesn't align with and so i don't want to let it stay in me so i want to work to shift it but in order [2830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2830.4s)

to work to shift it i have to be honest about it be willing to look at it and do the work on it right so there's a kind of shame that empowers us there's a kind that doesn't right there's a kind that says oh i actually value something else in the and i want to be more aligned with my own values so it empowers the agency to [2847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2847.119s)

work on something there's another kind that just makes you feel defeated and then you usually do more of the negative thing because it's a coping strategy for pain and pain comes when you're defeated so uh so there's a there's a way of contemplating your values where you're like yeah i don't live in the fullest [2864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2864.72s)

relationship with my values i could because i've come to these values through my own reflection on things but i was programmed in a different way i was in cultured and conditioned in a different way and i i don't need to feel shamed about what me as a little infant was conditioned and what me as a little kid was conditioned in but i also don't [2887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2887.68s)

want to keep it being that i don't want to keep being the result of my birth and my unconscious early time once i reflect on my values i want to work to bring myself into more conscious alignment with it and so so i do feel a certain healthy kind of pride when i notice that i'm making progress [2908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2908.559s)

that my behavior and my experience is more aligned with my values and there's a healthy kind of shame i feel when it's not which is basically just saying no i actually value my own values and i know that i'm actually not doing the very best that i could with this so i'm going to work on it uh about virtue development [2928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2928.64s)

for its sake because you actually think about it versus virtue signaling the thing about virtue signaling that's such a is that it destroys other people's belief in the reality of virtue because when people see a virtue signaled enough times and it's not real they stop believing it anywhere and then they just kind of go nihilist [2949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2949.92s)

um and then often kind of sociopathic as a result of the nihilism i so much more appreciate when someone's really coming from what's in it for me like i appreciate it being explicit right like like cardi b jeffrey epstein whatever style like i'm in this for me um i'm like awesome at least we know what we're getting like [2972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2972.48s)

and some people will be fine with that and they'll go along with it um so i want to see relationships where so another metric we could add is that it's not just the state of compassion compersion relative to jealousy empathy it's also an evolutionary metric that this relative to this is increasing right this is increasing and this is [2998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=2998.64s)

decreasing and in order for that to happen there's the healthy kind of authentic communication about it that allows us to understand the dynamics and help each other all right i think that's it curious if there are any questions on that and so much goodness uh that was uh just [3019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3019.44s)

presented um that conversion thing is just blowing my mind still uh yeah we have a lot of uh questions in the chat we might not get to all of them um but uh yeah let's uh uh take an elliott first ella you had a question yeah thank you i really appreciate this and so try and find the question itself [3041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3041.119s)

um i'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the difference between having this social health index and developing incentive structures or systems which encourage the movement towards uh unoptimized society that expresses these values uh in actuality incentives are why people virtue signal an incentive is intrinsically an [3068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3068.48s)

extrinsic motivation so if i'm incentivized to do x what it means is something other than x that i want is given to me for doing x right some y that i want a gold star a dollar a piece of recognition a trophy and so what it means is i really want y but i'll do x because somebody else gives me y i can't develop virtue that way [3096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3096.72s)

i can develop a behavior but i can't develop an internal congruency this is one of the things that's so tricky is how do you help develop what people actually feel and want not just their performance or their behavior and i can't use reward and punishment to condition someone's interior states in their reality so you cannot cause people to feel a thing [3120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3120.8s)

i mean you can make it more likely you can nurture it and this is different like good parenting is there's no algorithm for it right sometimes the kid is expressing the jealousy thing and you just listen to find out what's going on and find out where the kind of feeling of emptiness is and work with it [3143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3143.52s)

sometimes you teach them a lesson sometimes you share where you feel jealous right sometimes you and what is the right thing to do marshall rosenberg said something i really loved he said when it came to parenting he said stop just asking what behavior you want your kids to do and start thinking [3162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3162.319s)

more about what do i want their why to be for doing it and if i want their why to be that i'm afraid of getting punished if i don't and that i need my parents conditional love and approval so i will do it to get the conditional love and approval okay then keep using those methods but if you want their why to be that they [3186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3186.16s)

intrinsically care about certain things and that they have values that are meaningful to them that they're willing to invest in and sacrifice for whatever how do you nurture that it's a deeper question right so when you you said incentives or structures so i was picking on the incentive part to say one of the things i i'm looking [3208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3208.079s)

for as another health index of society is the ratio of intrinsic motivation that moves people to extrinsic motivation is another health metric the the higher percentage of human behavior that is motivated by extrinsic motives is the more people are going against themselves or having to kind of go against themselves because of some external structures that are force force functioning them to do that or where there's internal conflict in them einstein didn't do what he did because people were paying him for it and mozart didn't do what he did because people were paying him for it and jane [3244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3244.4s)

goodall didn't and the things that we find most beautiful in people is an intrinsic arising now the labor force forever has been a situation where civilization has needed most people to do shitty jobs for lots of hours to make civilization work so how do we get people to do that well if the jobs need the people then [3263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3263.119s)

either the state has to force the the people and we would think of that as totalitarianism or we have this liberal democracy idea that will let the market force them by creating a a cemetery where the jobs need the people so let's make it to where the people need the jobs and so we think of ins that decentralized system of incentive [3281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3281.68s)

is a good thing because it gets all the stuff done and seems a little bit more free robotic automation is about to overturn that whole thing robotic and ai automation and either it's going to create a world where those robots are owned by a few people all the wealth is concentrated and it's a way more world in terms of wealth inequality with [3297](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3297.76s)

a massive useless class or we realize that by ending the idea that we need a lot of extrinsic motivation because there's a bunch of shitty jobs that the humans have to do that we can procedurally the easiest jobs to automate are the ones that are the most wrote which are the ones that humans enjoy the least [3320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3320.88s)

and the things that humans enjoy more though are the harder ones to automate because they involve more creative process more intelligence etc so how do we move to an economy that is more based on people having commonwealth access to the things that they need so rather than what do i need to get [3341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3341.119s)

the whole idea also that you if you don't have an extrinsic motive system like capitalism you get a up welfare state it's just gibberish that's only once you've ruined people um put einstein on welfare put mozart on welfare put jane goodall on welfare put jimmy carter on welfare awesome what the  are they doing those are not ruined [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3364.4s)

people those are people who are connected to the meaningfulness of their life well when kids are chill when they're kids and they're asking why why why what is that what is that what is that and they're curious about everything and we don't answer any of their questions well and we don't facilitate their interest [3380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3380.88s)

in life and then we try to force them to be interested in that they aren't interested in we break their interest in life and then they just want a [[hypernormal stimuli]] and so then you have to extrinsically motivate them to do because from the beginning you've been extrinsically motivating them to do the and not following their intrinsic motive [3399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3399.28s)

well and then we do social science on a people who've been ubiquitously conditioned that way and call it [[human nature]] it's not [[human nature]] it's ubiquitous social conditioning and so this is my rant against incentive of course temporarily while everybody are incentive junkies because we've ruined everybody in this [3422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3422.079s)

way we have to make better systems of incentives that are less perverse but we also have to be working on moving from incentive to an entire culture that is focused on facilitating the intrinsic motivation of everyone now when people have is their emotional state this compassion compersion access their intrinsic motivation will also [3442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3442.079s)

involve benefiting everyone right in whatever way whether it's through their art or their nurturance or their music craftsmanship or their science or their whatever it is so then the question how do we nurture and condition the growth of that in other people [3465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3465.44s)

that's a great question how do we condition it in new children is a very good question how do we condition adults who've already been really affected i started by saying this is why i like psychotherapy right is because you have to change your psyche you have to be able to notice what are the patterns in the psyche you [3486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3486.72s)

have to look at where they arose from and you have to be able to consciously start working at shifting some of recognizing that consciously you value certain things that are not how you are programmed to be so how do you take those unconscious programs make them conscious and work to be able to shift them to [3502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3502.64s)

have more alignment and congruence in general the question how do we as individuals and how do we as parents and how do we as educators and how do we as people wanting to steward communities and civilizations condition the growth of virtue of any kind and people condition real inner growth rather than just external behavior [3526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3526.64s)

is a centrally good question one that we could take another stowa for and one that i know some things and it's maybe the topic i wish i knew better answers to than i do more than anything else thank you so many follow-ups but a lot of other folks waiting so thank you so much goodness here um khalil you had [3554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3554.799s)

a question that got a lot of uh plus ones you could answer yourself oh hi thanks thanks daniel that was amazing and thanks peter for having this event um this is somewhat of a personal question um so answer it at your liberty uh so my brief survey of people [3577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3577.359s)

um suggests that the ones who feel higher connected to a higher power uh don't have the existential fear that precludes the ability to love you can say that the cup runneth over is this connection to a transcendent power necessary for radical transformation today and do you have it do you have a [3602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3602.72s)

connection to a transcendent power to a transcendent reality yes transcendence to any particular reality as i can define it and um i'm not going to call it power there are problems with that word uh and so again if you are interested read that [3635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3635.119s)

document i wrote called the dance of the tao and the ten thousand things i think one of the ways that we up the most is by trying to take the transcendent and bring it back into the non-transcendent that which transcends conceptuality and then we try to conceptualize it so we can have certainty about it um [3654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3654.079s)

so i i don't know if this is historically true i have heard this narrative and i like it whether it's true or not so i'll give the example here the story here was that early jews said that it was had a recognition that the reality that we think of as god that they could think of as the transcendent the absolute [3678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3678.799s)

was important to not have a word to describe it because the moment you had a word it wasn't every other word it wasn't uh there there was something more associated and than other things less associated and that that would actually mess us up conceptually so that when they were talking and they wanted to [3697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3697.28s)

reference that they would reference it with a few moments of silence they would actually say instead of coming to god and saying god or higher power whatever they would just close their eyes and take a few moments of silence and try to in feeling access a sense of the transcendent that is trans conceptual and trans [3713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3713.76s)

linguistic whether this is true or not i love this story i love the idea of communicating that way and that words there's a symbol grounding there's a symbol to represent a ground but the idea of that which is transcendent isn't the ground it is that which is beyond any particular ground right so i don't want [3733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3733.44s)

a symbol for it but that doesn't mean that there isn't a relationship with it it means that it's trans symbolic right and the idea was that when they converted that spoken pattern into writing just leaving a space sometimes it was hard to tell how big the space was and was it really [3751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3751.92s)

a space between the words or not and so they needed a placeholder so what did they put as a placeholder to be unspeakable and that the uh so they picked the letters in the hebrew alphabet that were the most impossible to pronounce in relationship with each other the jhwh was an unpronounceable set of letters and so they weren't to represent a name [3775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3775.44s)

they were to represent the unspeakable the ineffable and so that when you were reading and you saw jhwh you just held silence it was a placeholder for that and that when that was translated later the vowel diacritics of either latin or greek or the other languages came in and that's how we got jehovah or yahweh from it as a name which kind of violated [3798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3798.079s)

the whole purpose of the thing like i said i i have not verified if that's historically true but it is metaphorically a true meaningful set of ideas einstein said it's a optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things and that in reality there is a one thing or oneness that we [3834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3834.24s)

call universe well it seems like they're a separate thing it seems like i'm separate than you and separate from this tree over here and kind of but if i if i remove if if i think about me without thinking about the planet if i removed the planet what would i be well i wouldn't exist at all [3860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3860.079s)

if i removed the sun what would i be i wouldn't exist at all if i removed the center of the galaxy i wouldn't exist at all if i removed the electromagnetic field or the higgs boson i wouldn't exist at all so i completely depend on heaps of things that i don't include in my definition of self which means that my definition of [3879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3879.76s)

self is just badly defined and my definition of everything else is badly defined so when you really get this you realize there are not separate things there are boundaries that have some distinction of one interconnected reality where none of it would exist without all of it so that all of it [3897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3897.039s)

there is a there's a relationship with that that is possible but it's trans-semantic and it's trans belief it's beyond a specific proposition to say this proposition is true or not true because belief has to be defined in terms of a propositional logic which is defined in terms of semiotics this is deeper than [3919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3919.68s)

that so the dow that is speakable is not the eternal dao but there is a relationship one can have it it's ineffable so if someone has a relationship with that ultimate reality that which we'd reference with silence that if we were going to call it something we would call it life with a [3937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3937.28s)

capital l or reality with a capital r whatever it is then i see everything else as an ex as a unique expression of that one reality a unique facet of that one reality and because it's a part of the ultimate reality it's sacred and because it's a unique part it's completely irreplaceably sacred [3955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3955.76s)

so then when i'm perceiving what am i perceiving i'm perceiving the whole of reality beyond anything i can conceptualize that that is the basis of what makes everything i love and value possible expressed in a form and in a unique form and the person in front of me is a form that has never been in universe and will never be again like this and i have a [3985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=3985.92s)

moment to interact with a completely unique possibility of experience i think when someone really gets this and you'll see in in dimelo's book this deep kind of like the relationship with the transcendent isn't i believe in a god which is just i made up an imaginary friend in my head to comfort myself [4008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4008.96s)

um and because i believe in that god i can torture people in his name um i can be more interested in the god in my head than the real humans in front of me or the trees or the life in front of me so it's very possible to have a very pathological relationship to a transcendent function i want a transcendence and an eminence together right that that which transcends every form is also eminently expressing through every form so then all life is sacred so then harming life is sin and the highest thing i could want a relationship with the transcendent is available through every [4055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4055.28s)

possibility every moment every possibility when jabron said it was in meditation upon the dew drop that i discovered the mysteries of the ocean so now the hungry ghost realm is gone when like say you do mushrooms and you go outside and you look at some trees anyone who's done mushrooms and got to look at trees has had this [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4081.76s)

experience and i'm not talking like 10 grams of mushrooms where the tree is dissolving and you know whatever i'm talking like a gram of mushrooms you're out there and you have this experience that the tree is so beautiful that you can't you [4101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4101.52s)

you can't imagine having enough time in your whole life to really appreciate it like it would be worth your whole life to just appreciate the beauty of it and you're wondering how the did i miss this tree it's in my front yard i've walked by it a million times and i've never really seen it but if someone asked you to describe it it's you'd say the same thing [4121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4121.12s)

still like the leaves are green and the bark is brown and the except why is it so much more beautiful even though optically it hasn't changed because a hundred percent of your attention is with it because one of the things the mushrooms are doing is kind of retarding the other cortical functions that have you lost and yeah but [4140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4140.319s)

i need to be doing something else and a laundry list and narrative and other thoughts and so when all of your attention is kind of in the sensory process you're able to really see the tree but this is also the just kind of mystical eminent experience that saint francis and everybody talks about [4156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4156.159s)

of seeing the overwhelming beauty of reality and the numinous expressed through form right so i go outside and i look at the trees and i watch the way all the leaves are moving and on all the trees and in relationship to the way the clouds are moving and i'm just i'm just awed by it right like it's just exquisitely [4181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4181.12s)

beautiful and i'm like man i could have been born on a planet where vision wasn't a thing or where i only got to see in black and white as opposed to all this color or we're not born at all just no experience and the depth of this experience just the amazingness of experience at all of something rather than nothing at all [4204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4204.08s)

of the beauty that's here is is so epic it's so infinitely precious compared to nothing i would choose to incarnate if i got the choice to this life and all the difficulties of this life just to experience this just to get to have this experience of color in motion with this tree in the sky and i've had this experience so many times where i am i'm listening to music i'm watching a tree i'm making love i'm whatever it is and i'm like  experience is so incredible that i would incarnate my whole life for this moment and when you take that seriously and contemplate it you're like man i've had [4251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4251.84s)

so many moments that are worth a whole life already i've had thousands of lifetimes worth of incarnating for and i'm still run by what's in it for me did i not pay attention like uh and when i when i kind of get that then there's like a the rest of like in having any more amazing experiences just gravy [4274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4274.719s)

and the fact that they keep happening is amazing and they're also available any moment i actually pay attention it was in meditation upon the dew drop that i discovered the mysteries of the ocean and there's always a dew drop in every moment right there's always a expression of reality i can pay enough attention to [4294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4294.0s)

the way rilk in letters to a young poet to the in the first letter talked about and if you can find no inspiration in reality even go to your memories right that even just in the memory of the experience there's enough to be to find exaltation moved by so this is the answer to the hungry ghost realm and it is a transcendent but it's a transcendent and eminent right it's both the transcendence into that which is beyond all achievement and form and then the embodiment of it how do we move higher in the spirit and then spirit express through form spirit what does that mean transit you get the idea right [4335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4335.52s)

and uh do i think that is necessary yes do i think it requires something like believing in a god i usually think that gets in the way because you have converted the transcendent to a semiotic proposition to believe in or not believe in that was a mistake that was that was an [4362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4362.32s)

impulse towards the thing and then actually having the reality of that which is beyond definition trying to get captured by the definition part having the comfort with infinite unknowability get turned into trying to have certainty about a thing awesome thank you uh cleo uh definitely compelled to do shrooms now after the session um [4391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4391.92s)

do you have one more uh uh uh time for one more question daniel sure cool uh margaret uh you're up next well thanks peter thank you daniel this is um resonating to say the least um so my question is about energy dynamics music and i'm wondering how you view the energy dynamics of people escaping the gravity well of anger and jealousy on that anger jealousy compassion compression axis because there's in the short term a seductive incentive around anger and the gross availability of energy that becomes available when you're [4437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4437.92s)

dwelling in that place i really like the way michael jordan talks about it in the last dance of how he like would generate these conflict scenarios in order to fuel his playing it's like a really nice example of how we do that so i'm wondering how might we invite individuals to direct their energy towards [4457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4457.04s)

moving in the direction of compersion and compassion knowing that it's a pretty high activation cost i think when you take the examples michael jordan is a good one and you look at the muhammad ali mike tyson conor mcgregor kind of energy i'm the greatest i'm gonna beat the out of them whatever it is [4482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4482.48s)

we realize that it's effective to um up regulate certain types of capacities what you notice is that what each of those people are doing is mostly embodied animal behaviors right they're we're talking about sports in a body and that it's very important because what we're [4505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4505.679s)

talking about is a very primitive set of emotions the fight energy out of fight flight freeze the fight energy is the up regulation of certain kind of neural endocrinology that activates fast twitch muscle fibers and activates glycolysis and stuff right so if i'm literally talking about hitting and running [4528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4528.719s)

that thing works but that same sympathetic nervous system activation and adrenalization decreases prefrontal cortical activity decreases the capacity for most rationality design empathy so you don't see einstein doing the conor mcgregor energy because it wouldn't work it would actually make him suck at the thing he [4554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4554.239s)

was doing um and so it's important to get that that thing works for activating a evolutionary fight process in the body to increase muscle activity and now there's a lot of other emotions that go along with those hormones but they aren't those emotions don't actually [4573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4573.679s)

make you better at other functions and very much in the way that a high person high on pot is blown away at how good their ideas are and their ideas totally suck because their high brain is interpreting them and the silver people around them are like man those are those are not good ideas um in the same way the person who's high on the endocrinology of anger might think that the way they're thinking about strategy to solve social problems is good because they feel activated but it's not good it's bad strategy and it's why it usually produces really shitty results and much better results happen from people [4612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4612.0s)

who can do much clearer minded thinking which is why when it comes to activism and social strategy where people are upset and they're traumatized i want a space for trauma healing and then i want a space for strategy and they're not the same thing and the trauma energy ends up making shitty strategy that ends up being [4631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4631.92s)

self-destructive even to the goals in the long term though it seems fulfilling in the short term and that thing of like yeah but like you know when you're really angry you want to say the thing before you calm down there's a party that's like i should come down and not say the thing right now but there's a party that's like yeah but i don't want to be calm i [4650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4650.239s)

always let myself become i want to say the thing and then you say it then you regret it and you're like why did i say the thing why didn't i calm down there's an autopoetic energy any energy that we get into it's almost like that uh peter would call it a demon right that that demon or that [4669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4669.36s)

neurological process wants to keep living it wants to act it has a momentum to it this is why there's a question of do we have a witness and do we have a set of higher order values because all of those different momentums in us want to keep acting and they're not all worth letting keep acting right so uh addiction is a very good example if i'm coming down off heroin i don't give a about anything other than getting another hit i don't want sunsets i don't want a friend i don't want to hold hands i don't want to learn some new thing i don't want to help homeless people i want a hit because nothing else is going to [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4718.4s)

make me not feel terrible because i have so conditioned myself to that particular [[hypernormal stimuli]] that nothing else will do and if i do the short-term thing that makes me feel better i'm probably going to die on the thing right because that short-term thing that makes me feel better also increases the [4733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4733.12s)

addiction and i now keep needing the heroin relative to anything else and my and the thing about addiction is it gives you a spike and then it gives you a crash the crash makes you need a spike again and as you keep doing the crashes and spikes your baseline erodes that's essential to the addictive [4752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4752.88s)

process on any addiction whereas with healthy process if i work out or i eat some healthy food i don't get anywhere near as big a spike instantly as i do from the chocolate cake or the heroin or the gambling or whatever it is in fact it might even be kind of not that fun in the moment but then i have increased health [4776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4776.08s)

endurance capacity whatever as i keep doing it and so my baseline increases over time and i actually start to get a reward circuit associated with noticing progress and so i'll get a reward but it's a different nature of reward it doesn't have the same nature of crashes and it has a uh a difference in the change of baseline so this is the two marshmallow experiment right the kids that didn't do well of the two marshmallow experiment didn't do well at the most of the rest of life and so there's a question of do we have the ability to do impulse control over short-term and be more focused on long-term [4813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4813.04s)

advantage all environmental harm is short-term focus at long-term expense almost all war is it seems in the short-term best interest while not recognizing that we're driving [[arms race|arms races]] that make worse wars that will kill way more people worse in the future uh we get so focused on how do i make [4835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4835.12s)

this political win because my side has to win this four years not realizing that the next four years will will swing harder the opposite way they'll utilize whatever tools of propaganda we developed and make better versions and then they'll undo whatever we did for these four years we're stuck in the cycle and the thing we're doing for the [4852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4852.719s)

short-term win is driving enmity of the other group and increasing their capacities so getting out of the short-term reactivity process to be able to say what is a long-term goal worth having and how do i actually become in better service of it is necessary for anything worthwhile so then the question how do i become a [4875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4875.28s)

two marshmallow kid if i'm a one marshmallow kid meditation where you don't scratch your nose when it ditches it's a great example right where you sit up straight and when you want to move you don't for 15 minutes until the bell goes your body's going to stay straight and when you want to hit your nose you don't itch it [4898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4898.08s)

and you hold the mantra and your mind wanders and when it wanders you bring it back to the mountain and it wonders you bring it back to the mantra what are you doing you're developing increased agency over your own self and increased impulse control to not have to itch the thing to not have to move you take cold showers [4917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4917.44s)

and even though you don't want to get in the cold shower you do it anyways and then you consciously relax your shoulders when they want to tense up and you take those impulsive processes and develop more agency over them you work out when you don't feel like working out and you develop positive reward circuits on it [4934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4934.4s)

more than anything hang out with other people that are too marshmallow people rather than hang out with other people that are one marshmallow people because as social creatures the people were around condition us the fastest and until you have conditioned yourself to be too marshmallow you can't help other people be so you might as well be around people [4950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4950.56s)

that can help you until you stabilize it then you can help other people but there is a place and this is where i said the healthy shame comes in that's where i said like i get you know when i read the demelo i got so disgusted with myself thinking about like he had these inquiries into what is love he's like [4973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4973.6s)

when i say i love somebody what i mostly mean is i like the way that i feel when they behave specific ways and if they don't behave those specific ways i'm willing to punish them i'm willing to hurt them into behaving those ways through fear and guilt and shame and emotional manipulation of various kinds [4994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=4994.4s)

and we call that i love you well it's actually disgusting it's not love it's like some weird cannibalism or addiction and thinking about it that clearly is very helpful to me to be like actually i would rather be with no one than do that like i'm so disgusted at myself for that i would just rather be with no one i'd i would actually the samurai thing i'd rather kill myself if i can't get past that i don't need to keep doing this thing i can get i can get past that like i know that i can get past that thing and do better but it's gonna take some work but i'm willing to work at it so there's a place also where i think about enough i can't behave that way and respect [5030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5030.239s)

myself i must actually be able to respect myself to feel the integrity of myself so i'm willing to just step away from the job the relationship whatever it is and work on myself enough to come into alignment with my own self and that's what i would call like a depth of congruency where one starts taking the meaningfulness of their life seriously i don't know if that helped those are all useful ways to transition from being a one marshmallow kid to a two marshmallow kid i guess i'm more curious about less on the individual level um because i think that once like you said once you [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5071.28s)

recognize that within yourself there is this intrinsic motivation to be doing that work that practice constantly that's like a lifelong thing um i guess i'm more curious about how do we aside from literal embodiment of being a too marshmallow kid and developing that and oneself how do we invite others to [5089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5089.12s)

develop those same internal intrinsic motivations knowing that the activation energy to get to two marshmallows like two marshmallow state uh is quite high and that there is you know when you sit down a meditation and you don't wanna don't move to it your nose you know you [5108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5108.159s)

fail a few thousand times before you actually sit there and don't itch um so more like how do we support that place of fumbling um before you see the ramp up of actually getting a effect from your actions yeah yeah so go ahead and just throw on a second question there too is um in terms of distinction between [5130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5130.719s)

short term and long term i'm curious if you have any temporal scale of what you're thinking of isn't long term how long term depends upon the actual kind of causal cycles associated with the dynamic if i am thinking of cutting down a forest how long will it take for that forest to regrow the complexity of it if i'm [5156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5156.56s)

thinking about kind of mowing down a hemp field it'll regrow in a year if it's an all-growth forest it'll take a thousand years so um so the time scales involve thinking about what is affected and how is it affected and so there's obviously there's a various range of time scale it's different for [5178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5178.48s)

um for different activity what about for a healthy civilization well it depends on a civilization has choices like do we cut down trees or not versus do we cut down hempfields or not like i i have i have to be thinking so the the seven generations is a nice idea because it has us go far enough ahead [5200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5200.96s)

that we think more creatively than we're kind of habitually likely to do typically we're mostly going to think about ourselves and maybe our kids life because of the thing where we're automatically connected to so seven generations or a thousand year timeline is a good timeline to think about obviously you'll be able to think a lot [5225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5225.28s)

more granularly about a hundred year timeline and you'll be able to think more granularly about a 10-year timeline so there's a whole scope of timelines to think about ultimately how do we support the thriving of all life in perpetuity right perpetuity is as as far as i can sense it as far as i can sense it as best i can sense [5244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5244.32s)

what is aligned with the thriving of life is the time scale where i kind of start and then back up from there now the question you asked about not how do i become more aligned which is what i thought you were asking but how do i support other people and that is more aligned with elliot's question [5261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5261.6s)

of uh how do we effectively support the development of values virtue psychology psychological development mindfulness etc in other people and particularly at scale if that's the question i would say it's funny [5287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5287.6s)

my my sense is that buddha and krishnamurti and everybody of that type struggled with this question more than just about anything else like man how do we help more people get this thing it's kind of a hard thing to do and you can see that none of them succeeded as much as they might have liked but also didn't succeed none and so we can see is it possible to create like a buddhist culture where based on how the children are growing up it's a lot of things it's the educational system but it's the way the parents are it's the way that not just the parents but the other people in town and the even what the [5330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5330.08s)

kids are being exposed to in terms of media that all of that is a part of it it's the they're learning tong len from the time they're little um so one of the things i do is when i think of any particular virtue i try to look at the culture that developed it the best as a positive deviant and see how did they do it [5350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5350.32s)

and then try to see because they weren't doing it in one or two people um it wasn't kind of a spontaneous thing it was oh that culture actually did a pretty good job like jews did a good job of a high level of academic education across the whole population buddhist and jainist did a pretty good job of non-violence across the whole [5367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5367.6s)

population so they try and see like well what did they do culturally they brought that about and which set of those things could be synthesized to make a culture you know anthony demello wrote some books and gave a lot of talks and lectures and [5384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5384.96s)

worked with people and i think that helped makes made a church that work with people you know every sunday and all week long uh i think the idea of like well can i make a [[blockchain]] type system that makes a better system of incentives so that even if it's still extrinsic motive i'm at least not extrinsically motivating [5403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5403.76s)

people to the most pathological behavior and thus kind of conditioning sociopathy that's a good that's a good way of uh thinking about it can we move out of a two-party system that forces the primary event in media to be a a rivalry and [[narrative warfare]] driving camps against each other that is conditioning almost the worst thing in people using their deepest kinds of fears and emotional hijacks could we make a system that did something better than that so there's like system level answers we look at facebook and if it's optimizing for time on site and people spend more time on site when they're limbicly hijacked because consciously they don't want to spend [5446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5446.88s)

that much time on site and they spend more time on site when their bias is being confirmed because they're going to spend less time on their biases when they're hitting cognitive dissonance then of course a piece of technology that is using all the internet's information and ai optimization to double down on people's [5463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5463.84s)

bias tribal identity and limbic hijacking is kind of the way tristan harris talks about uh collective downgrading and that's kind of a collective downgrading using [[exponential tech]] could we use the same [[exponential tech]] in a collective upgrading that was actually doing like personalized education [5484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5484.32s)

factoring all that personalized data for people to present education in the most compelling ways unique to them that they would find most interesting uh including even things like media literacy and mindfulness stuff that made them more sovereign even to that system so i think the answer there's like what can i do to help my friends and family [5504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5504.56s)

there's what can i do at a community level there's what can i do if i'm an artist a technologist someone who runs social institutions lots of different things that was that did help better and i will stop asking follow-up questions because i can see peter glaring at me so thank you daniel yeah thank you [5528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5528.0s)

margaret um so we passed the bottom of the hour uh so perhaps it's best to close here um daniel uh perhaps you're coming in next week i think or the week after on [[existential risk]] um any kind of closing thoughts on today's session and maybe setting up that one i didn't um i didn't get to read the comments as [5550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5550.0s)

they were coming in because i can't do both things well so i stayed focused i uh i'd be very curious to see questions and thoughts i'll see if before the window closes i can read some of them i because i'm curious how this model resonates with people um resonates very deeply with me and then [5573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5573.04s)

i'm curious how it resonates with other people and uh and if it does i'd be very curious how the stoa community as a community of practice might actually um answer the question that both elliot and margaret were kind of asking how do we support others how do we support each other to say is there [5596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5596.32s)

a is there a community of practice that we could have that helped in this particular way i could even imagine something like taking the uh demelo's book doing a book club with it and then having some kind of small group or diatic practices to be able to [5614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5614.08s)

share reflections and insights and something along those lines yeah i i definitely definitely feel called to have a session after this with the stoic community to kind of like sense make and then discuss and perhaps a community of practice can emerge i really love the model that you presented and so many freaking threads and thoughts are coming up for me and i imagine a lot of others in the room as well uh and i will save the chat and um email it your way so you have a chance to read it at your leisure um so i'll make some closing announcements in a moment but daniel thank you so much for coming to the store my friend that was a great interest thanks for having me thanks everybody for being here uh and as mentioned daniel's coming back on june 9th for psychological pitfalls engaging with x-rays and civilization redesign it's another patreon event at 6 pm eastern time dave snowden is coming back again to doing a session called hr  on july 15th at 12 p.m eastern time that should be really fun and uh yeah a big event noam chomsky and contra points the future of the left they're gonna have a conversation on june 28th at 6 pm eastern time another patreon still [5682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2nhiNCOXo&t=5682.239s)
