music when there's increased volatility in the market there's more opportunity to make more money if you play it right then when the market has less volatility and similarly when there's just increased volatility and say geopolitics as a whole there's more ability for more significant grabs of power than there are when things are more equilibria and so the saying never let a good crisis go [41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=41.73s)

to waste sometimes crises are just completely made-up right they're false flagged sometimes they're not false flagged but they are they just naturally emerge and then some agents are more focused to see how they can advance the agendas they already had utilizing the dynamics of that situation rather than try to fix the situation so let's say for instance [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=69.64s)

that i was one of the many people that got good intelligence back in early january about what was happening in wuhan and how many people five to seven million people left who hung before quarantine and that they got on planes not to the rest of china but to the rest of the world and what was likely to happen from that so we see some senators that sold stock in january right but [104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=104.5s)

that's a small part like those are formal intelligence briefings to people who have classified access but the private intelligence agencies largely work for hedge funds and financial institutions and things like that and they're looking at the same information so if i run a hedge fund and i see that there's a situation that could have meaningful downturn to the economy but i [130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=130.11s)

can make money when the economy goes down and we're already at the top of a you know a stock market that's probably about as high as it can be because the underlying economy is actually very unhealthy right the total percent of gdp that's going to debt servicing is unsustainably high the wealth inequality is unsustainably disparate it's [150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=150.68s)

basically a power-law distribution you have a few companies that make up most of the success of the stock market because it's cap-weighted and then almost everything else pretty profoundly lagging you have a totally unsustainable amount of total debt and all of that's resulted in the need for ongoing quantitative easing and a negative yielding bond market and totally weird [174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=174.79s)

stuff with that right and so the markets not going to keep going up and staying that high forever anyways and so being able to have that foreknowledge and say now is a good time to sell these stocks and by the way let's actually short a bunch of stuff to make money as the market goes excuse me to make money as the market goes down and then the value is gonna get really [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=203.48s)

low if if airlines can't fly the price of airlines is gonna get really low but airlines are a real thing the world's gonna need the value of that sense of kind of evaporate so being able to buy it up at hugely discounted prices before it goes back up is pretty awesome opportunity to consolidate power and let's say that i have large pools of liquid capital and i haven't so i'm a [226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=226.25s)

family office or sovereign wealth fund it has been hard to deploy that capital very effectively for a while because i've got negative interest yielding you know bond markets i can't just make interest by sitting on it and you know there hasn't been huge volatility of the type that could be very effective and market stock market prices were high but now you can deploy that capital very [248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=248.54s)

effectively by being able to buy up real valuable utilities at a very discounted price also if i am interested in increased surveillance capitalism or increased surveillance state or just concentration of power of any kind when things get worse people become more willing to accept solutions that have some consequences and so i don't even have to do anything to make it bad i [277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=277.71s)

simply have to not make it better say we're working on it and bureaucracies are slow until we get to the position that we actually have the capability to do something and so and if i'm trying to advance a geopolitical agenda and i really want an alliance with these countries who are currently allied somewhere else and i can just to help the situation break those alliances like [301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=301.95s)

all of those types of things i'm not saying anyone did anything i'm saying that these are reasonable things to understand that there's an incentive landscape for right now someone who people who own hedge funds or large pools of capital they had the intelligence of what was happening could they if they wanted to maximally help and you know try to start engaging [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=327.87s)

solutions and trying to use some of that money to influence governments to say hey let's actually put these travel bans on sooner and let's start getting tests gets rolled out and ppe distributed and etc of course they could and they can say it's not their job and it's not their job right their job is to maximize return for the assets under management for their shareholders which they do a [353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=353.79s)

very good job of do i think that's a conspiracy do i think they intended the virus no but i think that their incentive is to do predatory opportunism more than it is to solve the problem i think the vast majority of what we're seeing is just predatory opportunism i don't think it's all just that and so if you think about the power law distribution of wealth you have a few [391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=391.98s)

actors who have really just a small number like if you look at the house of saud and the house of rothschild and putin's personal wealth it's kind of like way above everybody else's right and then you've got like a small but larger said of a hundred billionaire's and and then it you know kind of falls deeply in the same way that there is a power-law distribution and wealth [420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=420.15s)

there's a power-law distribution in geopolitical power and in hybrid warfare power and so the few actors that have the most asymmetric capacity habit by being good at gaining and maintaining asymmetric capacity they didn't get it by like lottery right and so to think that the actors that have the most asymmetric capacity have it for any reason other than they're the best at [446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=446.1s)

gaining asymmetric capacity is naive and music so do those actors have more ability to influence the overall landscape to continue to advance [[asymmetric power]] yeah is it guaranteed what will happen no it's a high stakes kind of situation so if someone could ask i'm not gonna say anything here it's not relevant about specific actors but what i can say [481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=481.68s)

is if you have any actors that you are curious about you just say okay let's make a list starting in whenever starting in november or december of the things that the w-h-o said or the cdc said or whatever group you want to look at or president trump or whomever and say look at the things that they said in the things that they did chronologically in time relative to what [512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=512.199s)

would have actually been the right thing to do and made sense and then just look at the delta between those and then just try to explain the delta some of it totally might be incompetence some of it totally might be bureaucracy just look at does it does that seem to account for all of it i mean there are very basic examples the w-h-o was telling people not to wear ppe until not that long ago [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=537.11s)

and trump was saying this we've got this solved this isn't a big deal until it was almost overwhelming us cities right and chuck beijing shut down flights from ohan to the rest of china but didn't shut down flights from ohan to the rest of the world there are a bunch of studies that are in process by major public health organizations that are looking at the drugs that are currently [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=575.559s)

interesting the antivirals but only doing late-stage trials of the antivirals particularly of antivirals that are generic so there's a there's one particular study that is looking at hydroxychloroquine late-stage with vitamin c as the placebo i'm not gonna say which group it is but it's easy to find out vitamin c is not a placebo vitamin c is extremely well established [604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=604.029s)

for having antiviral benefits actually even in late stage more than most pharmaceuticals do and one can expect that late stage wouldn't be effective anyways so maybe that's just a dumb study maybe it's just a badly designed study but if i wanted to say look trump was an idiot or i wanted to say see this generic drug we can't make any money on doesn't work so this other drug or [633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=633.649s)

vaccine we have is the only option and so i wanted to have a particular result come out looking like science but it's actually not science because it's science being set up to produce a particular result i would consider that info warfare pretending to be science is it that or not i can say if i wanted to do info warfare i would do it that way [657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=657.43s)

so just because something is a randomized control trial done by a prestigious university does it mean that it's good information no this is a very important topic music now here's another important topic legitimate authority legitimate authority very powerful thing right because if there is something that seems [681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=681.13s)

like a source of legitimate authority that can decide what policy should be or control public opinion then the power of that is such that any group that is seeking the power to influence policy or control public opinion would have maximum incentive to try to influence that legitimate authority and so we have no problem seeing this in retrospect right we have no problem seeing the way [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=709.12s)

that priestly authority during the middle ages was very influenced by the kings and banks and whatever that we're all basically playing different aspects of power games and so whether we're talking about a legitimate authority that comes from a religious source or a science source or a one thing that you learn about science and this was this is kind of a postmodern of critique but not [737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=737.589s)

quite because there there's a more earnest way to take it the more complex this physical system the easier it is to very different answers based on how you set up the study and so the larger the data set is the easier it is to cherry-pick data that supports whatever i want where it's actually not lying it's just cherry-picked but similarly if i'm looking at [767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=767.23s)

something as complex as a cell or a body there's no way i can test everything that is relevant to that thing right so i can say well this particular biometric went up and that's a measure of health there might be plenty of other biometrics that also went up that are measures of illness or that went down that are measures of health but where they aren't even things that we look at [786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=786.959s)

in the study and so i can do info warfare very well with complexity because i can say what is the thing that i want to say to advance whatever the narrative or the agenda is and i can make something that looks like science that says that thing so just just because something looks like science can you trust that it is true no you actually really have to look at the [820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=820.44s)

preponderance of data you have to look at how the methodology was done you have to look at who funded it you've got like there's a lot of things and as the situation gets more complex the more so so basic physical chemistry inside of a beaker or how a transistor works is very very different than how a cell works now does that mean that all authorities are run by lizard people to [845](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=845.85s)

install 5g nanobots and think as part of the ai matrix no it doesn't mean that and that's one of the other things is people jump to kind of maximally paranoid pattern-matching do i think that sars co2 is a virus meaning a actual physical infectious agent that is not just the result of bio terrain or somebody's own endogenous exosome when it's exposed to 5g or [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=879.99s)

something like that yes i think it is a virus and i think that it's very well established if you we have been able to actually look at the shape and structure of the virus and lots of different universities independently and in samples from people and whatever and compare it to other coronaviruses and to sarris cove one and to look at how it would have evolved into being in the [911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=911.01s)

relationship with bats and other things do i think that 5g causes coronavirus no do i think people who have covin symptoms are really some other thing caused by 5g no the lope if you do look at a map of the distribution of 5g and a map of the distribution of sars or of excuse me of cove in nineteen they don't match there are areas that have 5g that were not terribly hit and their areas [946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=946.74s)

that were terribly hit that don't have 5g so i saw a number of studies that rolled out but not studies like memes they rolled out that said look here the places that were hit and these were all a month after 5g was installed or the first place have typed year whatever and they were just actually wrong like when i went and looked at it they there was some pretty compelling so i'm like wow [969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=969.15s)

if that's true it was not true and so this is just like basic fact-checking do i think that there are companies that are extremely powerful companies that are extremely focused on rolling 5g out yes i think huawei and verizon in particular some other ones have very deep investment in 5g do i think that the safety of it is well enough established to roll it out no but i [1006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1006.29s)

think that on some of the previous wireless communication - and i also think it on the cumulative load of the total thing so the fact that it's not ionizing radiation is not the only relevant saying yes that means that it's not like acutely causing you cancer like a microwave but it's signals transmitting signal does is signal transmission something that's [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1033.14s)

happening in your brain and between cells that is a part of how the communication of a biological organism works yes is there is it reasonable to think that there could be interference yeah should it be on the burden of the activists to prove that it's unsafe or the burden of the telecom companies to prove that it's safe before being rolled [1055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1055.55s)

out the burden of proof should absolutely be on proving safety do we need it no we don't need it well we need it for the economy to grow know the gibberish do we need it because we need an iot connected smart city world that fast no do we like fast and like we want to get to self-driving cars whatever yeah we totally do now is 5g based on the [1082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1082.4s)

frequency bands and everything going to be more dangerous or not than 4g haven't done the studies i haven't to know i can say that just intuitively i have concerns about it and i believe that once it's rolled out it'll be impossible to do proper studies because you won't be able to isolate it anymore you won't be able to get to environments where it's not without changing your [1112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1112.94s)

whole life so much so you've changed enough other variables that you can't say like oh yes when you're in the arctic circle your health issues change but was that because now you're in a pristine environment air wise or water wise or different sun or and so i think i would much rather that we were doing the right kinds of safety studies up front that weren't only looking at acute [1140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1140.96s)

effects but chronic effects this is something that i'm very upset about our entire medical paradigm is the topic of toxicity in general and deficiency of nutrients and pathogenicity in terms of infection we don't look at chronic subclinical issues so we have a clinical definition of okay here is you have a you have a clinical vitamin d deficiency right you you've [1174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1174.14s)

got rickets well here's the level of rickets or you you have a clinical vitamin c deficiency you have scurvy well pretty much nobody gets kerby right like you have to be in some up food situation you get scurvy which is why there are still a lot of kind of mainstream doctors who say you don't need supplements and nobody really needs vitamin c or vitamin d or whatever this [1193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1193.76s)

but then you have what is the optimal level for human thriving and the healthiest people with the healthiest diets and there's a pretty big range between the optimal level and scurvy and if you're here your doc's are gonna say you're not deficient but you might actually be and but the deficiency means you are now acutely dying right you are in an acute death process directly [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1219.35s)

related to this one identifiable thing but above that you might be in a you will probably live less long and have increased susceptibility to different kinds of diseases but you'll never be able to track it to this because it's your sub clinical level of vitamin c plus a vitamin d plus of a bunch of other things plus of toxicities plus of whatever right is basically just sub [1238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1238.94s)

optimal dynamics that support overall system homeo dynamics when we're looking if we're only looking at does this cause an immediate acute one for one thing to be able to say this was a necessary and sufficient cause of a disease that's just a broken model which is why i think in modern medicine were quite good at solving acute causation things if someone gets an acute poisoning or an [1266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1266.24s)

acute injury or an acute infection we're actually pretty good at that but when it comes to complex chronic illness autoimmune disease neurodegenerative disease psychiatric disease we don't have much in the way of real cures for those things we have symptomatic treatments and we have things that can stop certain parts of the disease pathology progression that's because it [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1287.51s)

doesn't have a single cause and the cause the many causes aren't even the same ones are different causes and different people and they're very delayed in time so there's a whole new model it's needed for that but if i'm doing safety studies looking for a near term cause which i would always if i am a company wanting to advance something i [1308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1308.96s)

don't want to be testing something for 30 years i don't want to be looking at the long term all cause mortality associated with the things so there's a very real question of how do we advance like how do we advance new things where the negative effects might be very causally delayed but then this is where we also have to think about risk and necessity and things like that so do i [1339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1339.29s)

think that the safety studies that are done are based on the wrong model of safety yes i think it's the wrong model of safety now do i think that there is a that 5g is a mind control system to kind of brown noise everybody's mind and to activate vaccine implanted nano chips and whatever i've never i mean it's an interesting idea if there was any group that was actually that well coordinated [1369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1369.35s)

and powerful that would also be kind of interesting i have never seen any evidence that is compelling when i followed some of those rabbit holes that the evidence that i have been able to find is not compelling that doesn't mean it's not true right i'm not closing the door on that's for sure not true maybe there are reptilians running but i have no evidence to believe so and it [1390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1390.44s)

seems exceedingly something that's actually a very interesting thing to do is to look at declassified documents of things that were conspiracy theories in the past and now we actually know happen because the documents got declassified and so you know there were several in the vietnam area the gulf of tonkin is a very famous one but also the firing torpedoes into [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1426.59s)

the water and saying that we had sank vietnamese ships to increase the escalation for the war and things about operation mockingbird operation paperclip cointelpro there's like there's a number of things that are now declassified because those people all died and we're during the time that it was still happening anyone who said anything about it would be a conspiracy [1459](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1459.83s)

nut and so and similarly when when the ussr fell there was a bunch of declassified stuff that came out in baltic states i have a friend that runs a private intelligence company who went to yugoslavia and pulled the intelligence records then and looked at the way that the kgb built their system of dsm to be able to classify anything that went against the state as a mental [1485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1485.03s)

illness and it was like very clearly documented how they did it and the ideas behind it and the whole thing about the way that j edgar hoover was targeting the black panthers not like that that wouldn't have been known except that you know people broke in and found the right so does that stuff happen yeah of course it happens and it happens in the public sector meaning government [1510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1510.62s)

intelligence agencies you know military it also happens in the private sector right so for when you see the enron type things for every enron there's a lot of those that happen all the time they just aren't caught and for every madoff and whatever that said most of the common conspiracy theories that i see are things that i can't find any good grounding for and [1543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1543.01s)

they're like many of them tend to be far more fantastical then just the kind of typical social science of yes of course groups with really big budgets probably have more advanced tech than is publicly known about and yes of course for [[national security]] purposes some should is kept secret and they're actually engaged in war and preparation for war and so and yes like the people that get [1575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1575.38s)

to the top of power stacks get there by being good at getting to the top of power stacks and that means a bunch of things psychologically in the disposition because there will be sociopaths that will want to overturn them and they will only not get overturned by the draconian measures of the sociopaths if they are better at being able to play that game than they [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1598.72s)

are you know we can talk about conspiracy as a function of the system incentives right whatever it is the system incentivizes creates a kind of topology and the people just kind of move within the shape of that topology but then they in turn shape the topology so there's a there's a reinforcing thing and one of the problems is that like sociopaths and sadists are a real thing [1624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1624.21s)

and people who are not that actually have a hard time believing that because they have empathy and they are empathizing with what it must be like to be someone else so they're getting wrong they have a hard time putting themselves in the position of someone who's inner experiences is different from theirs as it actually is but you know when you look at cluster b disorders there's a [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1645.49s)

whole set of disorders that are oriented to power and including abuses of power so there are not one for one and perfect not every time but statistical correlation with of high power and psychologies that are oriented to who want that and that means also differential an [[asymmetric power]] meaning use increased power over others to continue to grow and maintain [1669](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1669.73s)

[[asymmetric power]] it's funny how easy it is to see throughout history right like when we're looking at genghis khan or alexander the great or napoleon or whatever we're like oh yeah the those guys just went and killed everybody right and yet then we look at the people who are most powerful today they're genetically the same kinds of people who and we have a situation that [1693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1693.429s)

in some ways seems more civil but also in some ways just because we hide it better you know like we had a nice democrat and present presidency in the us and we drone strike to a lot of civilians and for very questionable actual motives and and [[factory farm|factory farms]] are as gruesome as anything that was done in the dark ages at a massive scale that almost everybody [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1728.88s)

watching this is paying to make that happen right so it's like oh i didn't kill her i pay the hit man okay you  paid to have the wet works done well buying something comes from a [[factory farm]] is that right you're like paying someone else to do this kind of gruesome what works and so the reason i say this is because i want to see us emerge into the higher angels of our [1756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1756.52s)

nature but we can only do that if we can also face the reality of the total set of things that the human experience does and specifically some of the uglier things that it does and the relationship to power that ends up getting and now one can also take that too far take that as a general set of principles and assume that everyone in a position of power is a child eating say this [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1786.19s)

satanist which would also be silly and this is one of the things that i find with regard to conspiracy is i find that people have an aesthetic bias where anything they hear as a conspiracy they either just kind of reject it up front off tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists they just automatically without studying it even though history shows how much people have conspired [1812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1812.42s)

just meaning some people share info with each other to advance shared agendas without sharing it with the public and sharing some disinfo you can go back to sun tzu and read about this info and how to do this info right like we've been doing that for a thousand years pretty intelligently and coordinated lee and so it's interesting how easy it is for people to reject something as oh that's [1835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1835.97s)

dumb conspiracy thinking when you actually study history then on the other hand there are people who if they hear any conspiracy they assume it's probably true and if they hear that anything came from a authoritative institution they assume it's probably corrupt and that's also completely silly because if the groups were that corrupt they would be overturned like if they were that [1855](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1855.92s)

completely in whole-cell corrupt or is a there's a balance of that it's not just evilness that gets them there it's also effectiveness at a lot of things right it is actually the ability to produce and manage and do logistics and the ability to win power games it's a mix of those things right so is everything coming out of a major university or major institution or you know government [1876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1876.56s)

regulatory body a lying conspiracy no is a lot of it at least highly influenced yeah does that mean that most of the people who are involved even no no of course not most of the people involved are just doing their job and they were told to research this so they're doing a good job of doing honest research on this now the fact that they're researching this as opposed to this and [1903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1903.2s)

that there's an agenda as to why to research this as opposed to that they will never even know that that agenda what this means though is that almost everyone lives in in a topology that is you know like what do i do for job protection there are certain things that like there's stuff i'm not going to say be i'll lose my job there's certain stuff i [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1926.39s)

have to say and i have to do to just keep my job i got to take care of my family so whatever it is even if it seems kind of unethical or ish or not the thing i'd most like to do it's office policy or whatever so just for job security and then for promotion and for ladder climbing i am gonna do the thing that's effective within that space so basically the incentives and [1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1948.83s)

the disincentives the topology of that space is going to inform my action as a average agent in that space but some people have asymmetric influence on the architecture of those topologies and so one of the things that i think most people don't think about enough is that a relatively small amount of fairly sociopathic people can create topologies that lots of otherwise not sociopathic [1977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=1977.39s)

people will participate in towards relatively sociopathic results so let's say that profit becomes a motive for war if you study history again the idea that that's a thing becomes pretty clear and when you look at the size that military-industrial complex is out of the total economic bloc and the size of the government contracts it gets compared to other areas whenever the [2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2009.19s)

fact that if the demand went away the the profit of the supply side would go away and it is actually the fiduciary responsibility of all business owners to continue to manufacture demand we can go back and historically look at cases right we can look at gulf of tonkin or whatever where there were false flag events for whatever motives so let's say there's some up motives that some [2032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2032.26s)

very small number of people have that end up influencing other people and the other people are not necessarily even aware of what those motives are the soldier who is in the battlefield isn't fighting for financial interest who's risking his life and making a relatively low wage but he still might be doing something that is when he is involved in the in the bombing or the whatever [2057](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2057.79s)

still might be killing civilians for wars it should never be fought and he just doesn't even know that right so he's engaged in an overall in activity that we could call sociopathic activity for non sociopathic reasons personally and we can see the same thing in the corporate world we can see the same thing in all over the place this was the ss troupe who were being tried in the [2081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2081.54s)

nuremberg trials and how many of them said no we actually didn't believe everything we were doing was good it started out with some ideological stuff and then it got really up and then when they were asked did you tried to stop no and they all repeated the same german phrases that basically said officers orders we didn't have a choice and so this property by which so yes [2100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2100.17s)

there's somebody does a really fucked-up thing they don't even make it obvious or they have some fucked-up motives and they create a set of office policies or command and control policies or whatever it is and everyone else just kind of doing their job and they're even usually told something that what they're doing is valorous or good right scientists who are told they're doing this for one [2123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2123.31s)

reason and then it is used for a weaponized purpose inside of military or whatever and then there's also that if one actor is developing a new weapon all the other actors have to develop the new weapon plus counter weapons there's the [[arms race]] side so both of those are the situations in which bad actors are capable of effecting a incentive landscape that affects lots of other [2147](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2147.76s)

actors one of the things we will need for an effective civilization is a way to be able to bind bad actors quickly which will require that kind of transparency to be able to identify that it is actually bad acting when they're seeking to dis inform which is this question of true information versus faulty information a lot of people have a strong bias [2168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2168.75s)

towards wanting certainty which means that they will adopt more certainty than the epistemic that they went through should warrant and this can be for different reasons it's generally wanting security and conflating security uncertainty and and so recognizing how big of an infinity the unknowable is everyone has to make very deep friends with uncertainty to not be mentally ill [2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2210.69s)

that doesn't mean that they have to do the move that all there is is uncertainty nothing can possibly be known which is also gibberish because the fact that i can't know anything with perfect certainty doesn't mean that i can't know things with much higher relative certainty based on certain epistemic processes that inform right action so do i want some kinds of trials [2237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2237.06s)

on my drugs before utilizing the drugs as opposed to just pendulum dowsing or guessing yes i did i definitely do and are there certain kinds of processes that will give increased certainty to be able to inform certain types of actions based on the consequent she ality of those actions yes does any of that give absolutely perfect certainty no because i can't rule out unknown unknowns but i [2262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2262.26s)

can certainly say i have enough certainty to inform right action here and so people having a mature relationship with certainty and uncertainty is that they're not uncomfortable with either there are a lot of people who have been trained up in more of a postmodernist camp we're actually very uncomfortable with any certainties even relative ones and it's [2281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2281.79s)

you know the assumption that all certainties probably imperialism it's probably someone gonna try and force they're not universal proof as if it was universal under the name of science on everybody or something like that but there's a lot we can say with pretty high certainty about the molecular properties of water there really just is or the speed of sound or a lot a lot of [2308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2308.47s)

things that are pretty well-established they're very useful and it's like you know like dawkins says here rightly planes actually work whether you believe in them or not and there's a there is a reality to the mechanisms in those domains so it's important to be not only able to have certainty where it's warranted but to seek it to seek basically better and better [2342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2342.07s)

understanding of reality to inform more responsible choice making but in order to do that i've got to ignore i've got to admit and acknowledge and be comfortable with the amount of uncertainty that's there so that i can assess where i'm currently at and what the appropriate process to come to enough certainty to act is so i see that same weird certainty on both the [2366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2366.609s)

conspiracy theorists and the anti conspiracy theorists like there's this in-group thing where one is it would be so bad for my in-group if i was part of the critical thinking anti conspiracy camp and i started saying you know maybe there really is such and such that there's pretty strong incentives other than just clear thinking against it there's also other kinds of cognitive [2396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2396.21s)

biases that we can talk about that are actually pretty important aliens i don't  know that i have seen some evidence that i find quite compelling of some things i have seen enough video evidence of objects moving and particularly declassified military stuff not just the recent tik-tok but lots of things that do acute angles at speed which [2433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2433.06s)

doesn't go along with the nurse as we understand it maybe it's just a hologram which would make sense right because the hologram can do that or maybe it's a plasma being moved around by e/m field or something or some kind of directed energy weapon thing maybe it is some kind of physical ship maybe i don't know but it when you look at something like the disclosure project and all of the [2457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2457.81s)

military officials very senior rear admirals and four-star generals and whatever they came forward and described the experience that they had with unidentified objects objects that they couldn't identify is that compelling yeah it's totally compelling for me that there is that many of them describing some kinds of phenomena does that mean i get to jump to knowing what the [2481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2481.03s)

phenomena are nope does that mean there are aliens or there aren't aliens i don't know but i i neither feel comfortable saying i for sure have a clear sense that it is or i can for sure rule it out i can say that a lot of people who understand how to read radar and who understand as fighter pilots or astronauts or whatever how to identify the types of man-made objects in the sky [2507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2507.19s)

have seen a lot of things they can't identify did seem earnest as opposed to just lay dumb people so that's totally fascinating for me but i'm comfortable enough with uncertainty to leave it at fascinating and say if i could figure out where i would do i think that there are people that are airing on the side of unfounded conspiracy theories and more of them [2536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2536.08s)

together and with more certain teams yes definitely do i think there are also other people airing on the side of being comfortable with more authoritarianism like the exact opposite side it totally shouldn't be that are actually under paranoid about what the true authorities are telling them and how they will handle things yeah i totally think that both of those are happening nearly [2560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2560.5s)

equally and equally concerning lis no i'm actually more concerned by the second one honestly i think that there's a problem with people saying that they think that there isn't really a virus they can absolutely up endemic up of that belief but i think the other people who call for [[national security]] actions to solve this that leave authority states also creates a problem [2586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2586.57s)

that could be worse than the virus i think there's another reason that people are kind of having that increasing sense is that there are a lot of increasing authoritarian measures happening which is legitimately concerning and should be for anyone who has paid attention to history and i think a lot of people do have the awareness that even if something wasn't intended as a grand [2613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2613.36s)

plot that opportunism is a thing and i don't think that most people think that facebook and google want everyone's data for their good you know for everyone's good like they they commercialize the  out of that data in ways that do not necessarily improve the lives of the people and sometimes like like they're actually turning the people into a commodity the other thing is that when [2640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2640.63s)

you see developing nations respond better than the us which has happened for a number of them and when you see mmm when you see vietnam responding better right and some latin american countries and whatever and you see how far ahead we knew this was a thing and you see the intelligence briefings that were there [2673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2673.9s)

and the lack of response and you know what the logistical capabilities of the of the us military and dod that wouldn't even have to override anyone's freedom to just offer logistical support our and you know how much damage is happening to the economy and how much cheaper it would have been to actually do upfront work and the fact that there weren't tests and that by the time we had got [2694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2694.99s)

our first hundred thousand tests out germany had been doing five hundred thousand a week for a long time with a tiny percentage of population there's so much of that that a lot of people are like is that just incompetence like it's almost mind-blowing to imagine that that's just incompetence given that we have so much actual competence like the if there's anything the us [2718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2718.569s)

military is really good at like it's really good at logistics and it doesn't have to be deployed in a way that overrides any civil liberties to simply be deployed to support stuff to support [[supply chain|supply chains]] and get ppe where it's supposed to go and why wasn't that why didn't happen why didn't we get you know and when you look at germany and its testing or you look at hong kong and [2745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2745.75s)

the way it shut the borders down you look at the way south korea rolled it out as a democracy or you look at the way iceland did you look at this and so and then when you also look at well why the did beijing not let anyone fly from wuhan to the rest of china but they did let them fly from wander the rest of the world and a number of other very strange things about the flows of ppe [2768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2768.64s)

and stuff like that i think that people will jump to the wrong theory but sometimes because of a right intuition and the right intuition is there are some agents benefiting from this and i don't feel good about it and then a rather than being able to sit with the uncertainty long enough to do the right kind of research so like did trump get this wrong for a long time in [2802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2802.27s)

terms of saying oh there's no big deal we got it handled whatever yes totally does that mean he's driving the whole thing for some agenda for himself super effectively and it's really because he owns shares in the hydroxychloroquine company and that's why he said it well i would say that that's not very good conspiracy investigation the fact that he owns some shares in a financial [2826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2826.99s)

services company i think it's like a mutual fund or something we're doing some shares in a company that produces hydroxychloroquine which is a generic which means that it doesn't have a patent on and lots of companies can produce it and there's not much money to be made on it yeah like you don't do really good conspiracies for like a few bucks you you could have to you have to [2846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2846.099s)

do something better than that so that's just like a follow the money trail but not not that money trail right that just doesn't look like a particular good money trail so actually the main thing i want with conspiracy theorist is that they get better at it did they get better at actually studying history and settings physiology and being able to actually check facts and follow [2867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2867.73s)

accounting records and you know go read the doctrine of unrestricted warfare to have some sense of what pla and ccp likely think the whole idea don't ever explain my malice what can be explained by incompetence that's also an important rule like slow-moving stupid internally friction filled bureaucracies like that's a real thing and the fact that we have a lot of systems that are super [2898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2898.329s)

ossified and are not good at [[sensemaking]] and not agile in their response like that's a real thing so you can certainly ascribe a lot of stuff to that where there are groups it seemed to have good intel and the agenda capacity to act and took the wrong actions it's more interested you still don't necessarily know what the motive was and this is one of the interesting things about like [2920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2920.38s)

motive is something that is outside of the domain of the formal methods of science which is why social science called soft science because i can't measure your motive i can't do a third-person measure and repetition on that measure well but can't i measure your brain well we don't really have perfect one-for-one neural correlates right so i can observe [2939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2939.97s)

your action and then i have to try and infer motive and belief and the inference is a big step now maybe you wrote an email i can find your email and you express it or whatever so this is where people have to be careful if they actually want to try to do sense-making well to just look at where did i make a logical leap and what was my basis to make that leap and how much how much of [2970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2970.9s)

a what are the different answers that it could be here and let's run all of them and then how do i say for this particular premise how how would i falsify this or verify this or if this was true what other things would be true that i can look for if this was false what other things might be true that i can look for there the certainty of this is just a virus everybody's doing the [2996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=2996.099s)

best they can the political party i don't like is kind of at fault for the bad response and those guys but we just need to band together and kind of help our political party win this next time and solve the virus and whatever and in a national participation the certainty of that or the certainty of we know the cabal that is organizing this whole thing for 5g mind control whatever [3022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3022.44s)

they're both comforting in a certain way now the bias here that i find interesting is there there's lots of nuance so i'm gonna oversimplify but i definitely see people that have a towards or away from conspiracy bias that corresponds with their general bias of how they relate to authorities and like i said i'm oversimplifying but the oversimplification is a starting place [3051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3051.69s)

for me and i'm gonna even postulate where this comes from but again not all the time this this is a pattern that we can observe enough of the time that it's interesting to look at the reason i'm careful with saying things like that is because when someone over norms their patterns that's one of the places that their [[sensemaking]] becomes bad i have seen relatively often people who generally think that government bodies are kind of lame and ossified whatever but mostly regulate in the right interests you can largely trust authorities the universities mostly say true stuff whatever things those people the generous authorities also generally have a frame that things are mostly getting better in the world [3103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3103.14s)

right now a lot less people have that frame but in general that frame and generally not always those people did better in childhood like at school in sports they're oftentimes their parents were either more success or they did better relative to them so they had this experience that the system actually works for me and that the authorities are are actually trustworthy and i have [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3128.64s)

a good relationship with him and that creates a kind of intuitive felt sense so it's so kind of like the symbol grounding felt sense where then even if they're in another environment where that's not true and it was true in the little micro environment of their childhood that's still the felt sense and then they sometimes will keep that forever or they have to be disabused of [3152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3152.22s)

it somewhat painfully at some point now other people who have the general sense that most authorities are probably corrupt and probably abusing power and that most institutions can't be trusted and that people with less power can be more trusted and that there is usually some process of corruption that is required for climbing power ladders those people generally weren't very [3179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3179.3s)

successful at climbing the ladders early and often times had authorities that abused power or that were like negative experience with them whether it was parents or school or church or whatever it was not always but i'm giving an example of a kind of bias that can occur which is a towards or against authority bias a kind of result that can happen more likely to believe in [3204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3204.56s)

conspiracies that the authorities are bad or more likely to reject that the authorities are bad and they kind of developmental environment that could give rise to it there's other developmental environments could give rise to it and there's other biases involved in conspiracy but just one example of a developmental pathway as far as the sentence making for the [3226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3226.85s)

ongoing covert situation goes another principle that i'll share that i think is helpful and it will help you notice where you're it'll it'll help you make sense better but it'll also i hope you notice where your own biases are is if you read something that seems compelling on a particular idea like that immunity is conferred or immunity isn't convert try to find things that say the opposite [3254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3254.53s)

that also seem the best thought out there are and see if you understand the arguments well enough to be able to parse the difference and if not don't hold a strong view on the topic so hey the only way to get through this is herd immunity that's the way that respiratory viruses work so we need to keep the elderly inside let everybody else go outside it'll be fine there won't be [3291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3291.41s)

that many deaths because it's really mostly only for the elderly and immunocompromised and the only way we get through respiratory viruses is herd immunity we've all heard some epidemiologist or pathologist or somebody say pretty confidently that well are there some viruses that we don't get hurt immunity to and we just really try to do [3313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3313.7s)

everything we can to stop their transmission yeah totally which one is this we don't know yet and does it seem like a meaningful percentage of the people who get infected don't produce antibodies is there good evidence that people who are showing cleared are getting reinfected is that reinfected or is it a resurgence or was it a false test does it seem like [3343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3343.0s)

in the studies coming out of china that older people are producing 3 to 5x the antibodies of younger people which seems to be the opposite of what we'd expect which makes us question what those antibodies will do will they will they protect against getting it again where you won't get it at all will they protect where you still get it but it's less severe or might they actually prime [3366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3366.73s)

a more severe response that happens with some things like thank-you fever given that people who die are actually dying of excessive immune response right cytokine storm responses or that a lot of evidence of that if the antibodies are conferred how long will they last and given the decay rate on them and how much can we infer from other coronaviruses about this which is a [3394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3394.72s)

novel one and you know you see different virologists saying this is not mutating anywhere near as fast as influenza and doesn't have the same recombinant oriole dynamics it's probably if we come up with a vaccine or people get immune it'll be against it'll be good and then other ones saying no there's actually reasons to think that there's going to be a follow-up round at least one and [3421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3421.99s)

it'll probably be more pathogenic before you decide which of those you believe make sure that you study the dialectic well enough and understand it well enough that you can ground where you land in it that's and so as soon as you read something compelling just go search for the end to this and then see if you really understand it i would say that is [3443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3443.92s)

one just immediate obvious rule of thumb rebel wisdom was set up to make sense of the world at a deep level than the mainstream media it was built for these times of crisis and change which is why we want to do what we can to meet the challenge of the times more films and also for our rebel wisdom members weekly sense-making calls with our amazing interviewees and also [3468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G70qtM66iY8&t=3468.829s)
