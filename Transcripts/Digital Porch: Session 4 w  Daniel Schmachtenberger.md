the stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of what's happening now all right let's not get too crazy in here um welcome to the stoa everyone uh peter limberg the steward of the stoa place where we cohere and dialogue about what matters most at the nice edge of [28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=28.88s)

this very moment last session with daniel schmuckenberger sensemaker in residence for october digital porch we all sit on the digital colonnade and the porch and just chat and have conversation with daniel um so far it's been uh kind of like anything goes but we're kind of refining the frame each time [49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=49.28s)

uh so how today is gonna work uh throw your questions in the chats in a moment uh i'll tell you when and then i'll call on you yummy yourself ask your question daniel um if you don't want to be on youtube because this will be on youtube uh let me know that and i will read on your behalf so daniel's gonna um [66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=66.32s)

set the frame uh for today um he mentioned it last time but we're just going to repeat it again and then uh start throwing your questions in the chat and we'll go from there so daniel i'll take you and my friend i think you can meet yourself now let's see you look like you're in like a [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=86.24s)

mastermind boardroom and you just kind of like erased all your your uh formulas for yeah there you go all right good to see everybody and i've enjoyed the three conversations we've had so far and this is the last one of the series and yeah i the you know original inquiry was [105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=105.04s)

could we uh address questions and so i was happy to do questions of any type and it's just in clarifying that a bit it seems like the main interesting intersection of questions that happens to be possible here in novel is not just asking about how do we solve world problems or just asking how do we develop our selves for personal developmental reasons but at the intersection of the development of ourselves in relationship to and service of what's going on in the world and what the world needs so you know there's one that just asked the world question is like well how do [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=143.68s)

we solve [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] let's take a specific example what would a good economic solution be but people ask questions in here more like how do i learn more about the kinds of game theoretic considerations to navigate [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] without being corrupted by it internally it's like a development in the presence of world dynamics so i think the i think the intersection of those questions is really fascinating i like i care about both of those spaces independently but particularly the intersection of them and it seems like the stow is uniquely well suited for that so just clarifying questions about and [[personal development]] means the development of the person not just [178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=178.72s)

what seems like psychological well-being but cognitive development skill development network development whatever uh so yeah i'm i'm interested in people's questions and inquiries in that space in particular right so boom uh start throwing your questions in the chat right now um you know take a breather [199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=199.68s)

maybe settle in and then people just bombarding questions already and just kind of feel into it uh and i'll i'll take someone in a moment let's see if i can start off with a question um related to the stoa and [[personal development]] and my [[personal development]] regarding that i'm finding all the challenges coming up here is really serving as like a force forcing function to practice my stoicism and becoming more virtuous which is quite cool i didn't really expect that um and one challenge or theme that has come up and i feel like it's going to come up more and we we talked about it before on [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=238.959s)

whatsapp is kind of unhealthy parasocial relationships and how people can start uh getting fixated on you um because you're in broadcast mode and whatnot and i wrote this entry on kind of culticulture and that kind of hit i put like some people secretly want a cult um and they want to project things on you uh and i wonder how you deal with that because yeah i'll just say this um this session in particular this series has the most people reaching out to me uh requesting things uh like oh you should do this you should you should do this because um you know you you're pretty popular and [277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=277.52s)

then your youtube videos at least on the stove i have more than most people um and so i wonder how you you deal with it personally and if you have any advice for me or other people at the stoa who are increasingly becoming a more public figure and want to do good in the world at the same time this might not be obvious to everyone [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=305.52s)

since i've done quite a lot of speaking publicly on podcasts and various things but i've never liked public speaking i actually particularly don't like attention on me as a person and so i just avoided it for a very long time and tried to work through channels of influence that [334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=334.08s)

were less public and i was particularly bothered by when people would focus on me like even this question as opposed to focusing on the topics that i was interested in and there's actually a certain point at which i just had to accept that that's going to happen to a certain degree and not be too bothered by it um [358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=358.72s)

if sharing publicly is useful and you know both work to encourage people to focus on the topics rather than personas but also not let the aversion to that get in the way of sharing things that can be useful um i think if someone is coming from the other place of having kind of desire for it more than a [384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=384.479s)

version there's slightly different things to uh work with i will say if there's anyone who is kind of excited to share things and be well known for them it's just less fun than you might think it is to have lots of people uh in a position to either [402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=402.639s)

have hope attached to you that you have no ability to really do anything about and then other people be able to strawman you that you can't address all of those things like it's yeah i would i wouldn't say that's a particularly fun thing um and the other thing i'd say is the the degree to which somebody actually [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=426.72s)

cares about anything right they have some basis of values and um integrity the more incongruency is painful and so then also the more reflective they are and notice the incongruency the more kind of intolerable it becomes so peter when you were saying as you're here sharing [446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=446.96s)

these things you actually feel kind of a impulse to practice and embody the things that you believe more because you're holding the space for other people to do it uh i think that's actually one of the cool opportunities i you know there's this perspective that says heal or heal thyself like get your own straight before helping anyone [467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=467.44s)

else and there's truth to that but there's also truth to in the process of helping other people uh there's a kind of learning that happens in sharing and facilitating and teaching that is different than the learning that happens just on the other side of it pedagogically the whole uh learn to teach model as part of learning is is very interesting i've noticed a lot of people who became therapists actually became therapists because at least in part as they were helping other people develop psychologically they were gaining continuous like instantiated nuanced insights about the [507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=507.68s)

nature of the psychology and other people and it really helped them in their own reflection and growth so that's interesting how do you relate with impression management and um like doing good in the world um in a broadcast medium uh where you're sort of like there's an avatar view gets created in [531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=531.76s)

the spectacle how do you relate to that avatar because i know i know you seem very careful about what you say and you want to know your audience in case any kind of information hazard kind of gets unleashed or something like that so i'm curious how you relate to your own impression in the spectacle [550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=550.08s)

in a way obviously that kind of informs me and other people who are putting themselves out there yeah i mean if you have a clear sense of why you're sharing something publicly you have a sense of what the positive opportunity associated that you care about is um you know there's kind of a swot there's a there there's some thread [578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=578.0s)

reliability associated with the opportunity and you just think through that and so for instance talking about [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] because you mentioned information hazard if people don't understand the reality of [[catastrophic risk]] then there aren't enough people who care to work on hopefully solving it so there's benefit [595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=595.2s)

to try to help more people understand how eminent [[catastrophic risk]] possibilities are and yet if you get so detailed that you start saying okay let me give you examples of very specific types of terrorist attacks that are possible in specific fragilities and [[supply chain|supply chains]] you're actually helping a lot of people who don't understand how to cause problems understand how to cause problems more with that research so there's a direct info hazard so it would have the benefit of motivating some people would also have a risk associated so there's definitely responsibility in considering those things and [632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=632.72s)

typically like there are some people whose work is as a public intellectual where their public sharing is the main method of contribution but i think more often what's effective is that people have projects that they're working on to try to benefit things and the public sharing is it is adjacent or you know facilitating [654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=654.16s)

something associated with that i don't think i would think doing this is very useful by itself like it's not hopefully it's not totally useless but um there's a lot of people who i work with right now in projects who i found through these mediums right there was putting some information [675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=675.2s)

out and it served as a kind of bat signal or a tractor dynamic they're very useful to projects that have theory of chains that i really believe in and then to the degree we want to actually launch projects that need some public traction having groups of people that are in similar conversations that weren't happening that get to be [694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=694.72s)

a place to advance certain kinds of cultural projects and movements is useful so have to think about the public sharing as part of usually more integrated strategies great thank you um so i'll start searching for some questions that are at that intersection but benita roy [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=716.48s)

privately messaged me a question that's her secret technique to get me to choose her um benita uh i really like your question if you can meet yourself and ask it too daniel daniel oh let me get this hi daniel um yeah so you know i want to know like like who are your mentors that's kind of like elders from you to elders but also like who are the young people that you think are emerging like you know like like they're not there yet so you're not gonna maybe uh advocate for their whole uh their whole view but like where where do you see something [760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=760.24s)

emerging that seems um like something possible that hasn't been possible before like like in what fields or what individuals and and again like these are half-born thoughts right if you're looking at young people or these areas and then you just i'm going to throw this on this because you said you're looking at people who have interesting theories of change and i was just wondering who the who they were thank you yeah um mentors i've i feel like i've always been fortunate to find and be able to interact with really good mentors and [811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=811.839s)

there's so many topics that i know are really consequential that i'm interested in that i don't have really deep expertise in and one of my fastest ways to try to get enough of a sense that i can navigate it hopefully uh competently is to find experts in the space that i think are earnest and really care and particularly find [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=836.399s)

multiple of them that disagree on critical things and so then i'll reach out to them and really try to understand uh have them guide me through the basic understanding of the topic and what they think are the foundational truths how they're forecasting it uh those types of things and then also and why the field is [859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=859.12s)

consequential what they think is important that everybody's getting wrong you know those types of things and then where people that i think are earnest and smart good thinkers who've spent 10 20 30 40 years working on a topic and i'm just not going to be able to catch up with that where they disagree and is it because they're looking at different data [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=879.519s)

because they're coming in with different epistemologies because they're weighting the data differently using different models and if if i can understand where they agree what is seen as common knowledge where they disagree and why then i start to feel like i'm getting some sense of how to navigate it then i want to see what would it take to [899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=899.36s)

bring about agreement right bring about consilience so i have like i actively seek out people who i think have good expertise in areas of history and various sciences social sciences whatever and have been fortunate to have a lot of them willing to spend a good bit of time [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=919.839s)

like educating me i just got off the phone with someone that everybody here probably knows jim rutt and he is um you know providing ongoing advice from a kind of ceo coaching point of view to what we're doing with consilliance project um and we have a we have a bunch of really great advisors that [940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=940.8s)

are providing advice in everything from technical to communications to brand strategy to the experience of what makes a good online forum in terms of the digital architectures and moderation and things like that i was just on a great call yesterday with a guy named gilbert morris who should come on here at some point [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=962.88s)

who i think has one of the more novel and really nuanced perspectives on the history of uh race and slavery and the situation in the us and kind of a third poll that is neither the pro or anti-critical race theory that that i think could actually further and so i've been um you know kind of diving deep with a [983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=983.759s)

bunch of people uh he's one of them to understand those issues more from really different perspectives perspectives of people who grew up in africa who grew up in the caribbean who grew up in you know u.s and europe and studied it from different perspectives so mentors uh a lot [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1000.0s)

and i don't require that i agree with everything to take someone as a mentor and i also don't require that i agree that i would take them as a mentor in all spaces to take them as a mentor in a space i think when we're young being able to get holistic mentors that are more like parents is easier as [1018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1018.24s)

we go on you know being able to find someone that you can really take their expertise in a domain and not reject it because you really disagree them in some other space is important in terms of uh what seems promising in terms of younger people it's interesting to watch like the way the rationalist community started to have very very informed high quality conversations where the people were actually quite well self-educated and were thinking about epistemology and formal logic and good faith dialogue and then where they actually started to get to the [1071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1071.6s)

limits of pure rationality and starting to think about symbol grounding issues so then they started like circling and getting into different aspects of other intelligences i i think that's kind of interesting um and i think there are some people who like we focus on the downside of being a digital native [1093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1093.2s)

and growing up in a digital environment where you get false intuition you don't get an intuition that is kind of conditioned on physics but on somebody's manufactured physics that's true and that's the more widespread thing but there's some subset of digital natives that got kind of very epistemically oriented who [1109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1109.52s)

are just  amazing at online research and specifically the [[open source]] intelligence field um they're really exceptional being able to do scrubbing of large amounts of data and image recognition and things like that and that starts to offer some way to counter the asymmetric info warfares [1129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1129.919s)

that are out there so i find that very interesting seeing things like what aubry tang and friends in taiwan are doing with digital democracy and how to kind of counteract misinformation and do better sensing and [[participatory governance]] i think that's quite interesting so i think there's a number of emerging spaces that that i appreciate um and some of them are very different if you take kind of the the um you know ascent space and then you take the like [[permaculture]] intersects with psychedelic space um there's some intersection those are [1173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1173.6s)

quite different but there's and there's some really kind of significant omissions or flaws in each of them and some gifts the fact that some of those spaces start having an intersection is actually promising to me and that's the kind of meta tribe thing that's being explored here which i really like it's why things like the [1192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1192.0s)

intersection of thinking about macro systemic issues and and how we personally and as a group relate to those is something that i am hopeful for and then the last question you asked was theories of change um yeah that's that's like a big thing i'm working on and and you happen to say that you were looking at some people had interesting theories of change or something new on the horizon it's that i think it's a that's a big deal for me anyways yeah i mean this this would easily take several sessions to try to say when we think of a theory of change being good does it mean that we've [1237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1237.44s)

mapped the [[problem space]] well enough that we can define a theory of change that is both necessary and sufficient and be able to do some proof of sufficiency is that what we mean by interesting theory of change that's a very high bar and or does it mean that there's something that from a forward engineering that's kind of from a [1253](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1253.84s)

reverse engineering point of view or from a forward engineering point of view a theory of change acts on a certain level of [[sensemaking]] an agency in a way that both increases [[sensemaking]] an agency so even though it's not clear that it converges towards sufficiency it's increasing its capacity in a direction that could converge and [1269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1269.6s)

then maybe there's a theory of change that by itself is not anywhere close to sufficient but it's really meaningful and in connection with a number of other things could start to map towards sufficient something working on governance something working on markets something working on culture you know et cetera um [1286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1286.96s)

so for i'll give you just a random smattering of theories of change that i think are at least well informed that friends of mine and adjacent spaces are working on that are not like commonly talked about so if you look at the way that the economy has shifted recently to have more winner take all orientation [1317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1317.44s)

than it previously had and small businesses closed during covid lots of unemployment happens but the value of amazon and tesla and kind of top stock companies double and um those types of things and then you look at the fact that you know something like two thousand to five thousand families [1340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1340.4s)

own most of the world's wealth and even though they don't necessarily own all the wealth when you factor just people owning their houses times how many people there are on land those people don't control the financial industry um or the the underlying um you know financial markets so disproportionately to just ownership of capital is the ownership of the change in underlying market dynamics so when you look at that and you look at the winner takes all type dynamics that continue that wealth concentration and then you combine that with high-speed algorithmic trading that can make very fast money on money returns [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1377.84s)

you combine that with the fact that the militaries of [[nation state|nation states]] can't the really top-end capabilities they have are weapons of mass destruction that nobody wants to use so if you take those away private militias are basically as big as nation-state militaries and those are available to the top families uh so basically [[nation state]] level military capacity is accessible for hire and then you take that they don't have people that they have to have a lecture in again and they don't and yet they can affect campaigns and elections across countries they don't have land they have to protect but they can influence uh land deals there are a lot of people [1417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1417.36s)

that think of this as the new emerging feudalism the 21st century kind of feudalism where families start becoming more dominant actors than [[nation state|nation states]] and so the theory of change being how to maximally meet the needs of those families in a way that also influences them that what would cause major [[catastrophic risk]] is actually decrease in security for them uh like that's that is a totally valid and interesting assessment and theory of change and it couldn't be more different than something like bjorkman's um bildung kind of model that is much more decentralized bottom-up cultural um trying to decrease [1462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1462.159s)

that wealth concentration so there's like one side says the wealth concentration is it's pretty inexorable so really try to influence the top of the power law distribution the other side says can we do a rolling debt jubilee or something to change that wealth concentration reboot a new financial system those are both interesting and then the [1480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1480.08s)

question is like do you run a portfolio of those strategies is there a way that those can have synergies with each other and then when you start to look at strategies that emphasize something like market versus military versus culture versus state and legislation are there synergies between those because nobody [1497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1497.919s)

can do all that work so they end up emphasizing a particular subset of actuators and yet multiple actuators if they were in the right synergy become more powerful so i'm interested in a network of solutions that maps to sufficient not a solution that maps to sufficient and so i'm interested [1517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1517.919s)

in people that can have really good faith interactions with each other to increase the coordination across different earnest theory of changes you could be anything thank you thank you so much um all right so next up we'll do ryan you have something about design principles if you can unmute yourself oop how do i start video there it is hey daniel thanks this has been really fun um so i had a couple of questions feel free to answer one none or any of them um and they kind of piggyback off of what we're just talking about about good faith so i'll just read them out what are the design principles that you have found most useful when engaging in collective problem solving are there criteria that you rely upon to promote or create a pro-social environment within which a group of problem solvers are more likely to encounter meaningfully useful discussion questions potential solutions and generate working models have you found that there is a quote dunbar's number of sorts for agents involved in collective design and lastly how do you think about leveraging embodiment techniques or ritual to invoke such a container thanks so much yeah this great [1612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1612.96s)

question uh and if i don't address all the parts of it come back to them because they're all good so when you talk about design principles there's kind of the object side which is what are the design considerations for understanding the [[problem space]] in a good solution and then there's the more kind of interpersonal side of how do you get [1635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1635.679s)

people to coordinate well to engage in collective problem solving and design and i heard you more asking the second one um but probably both so i'll see if i can address them both a bit if if you haven't had it yet um having forrest on probably forrest and zach together to discuss egp and agp which is something that [1658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1658.559s)

forrest spent the last few years working on as a design methodology for doing um complex uh problem assessment and design criteria to do this thing he calls transcendental design basically how do you do design in the complex rather than the complicated domain in a way that maximally anticipates and internalizes [1680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1680.799s)

externalities and also has the right design iteration process to be able to internalize externalities and additional considerations that weren't forecasted so it's both an upfront and an iterative process and uh i would say it is the best process that i'm aware of for how to understand the problem well enough that you get the design constraints to think through a solution um and that's the egp part of it the ephemeral group process um and i'll i'll just briefly say and i'm not going to address it at all it starts with purely questions um and this is actually a really valuable insight and just for everyone to kind of factor in your own design thinking so we're before saying okay we're building a bridge here now we're going to do a design shop on how to build a bridge the bridge is trying to solve a problem but the bridge might also cause some other problems which is why if we have a proposition to make the bridge or not make the bridge you're going to have [1744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1744.559s)

half of people on either side right very rarely do we have a proposition in in a kind of government situation that 90 percent of people are on one side of which means that most any proposition that goes through about half of the people really think it's a dreadful idea and so that process itself can't not [1763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1763.76s)

polarize a population and there was i don't remember who it was but there was some founding father that made a statement around uh voting as the death of democracy and most of us think about voting as democracy and it's like no no the town hall where you talk is democracy democracy the democratizing the process of input into figuring [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1786.399s)

something out is what democracy means voting is what you do to sublimate warfare when you can't figure it out um but the goal in the town hall is can we all share our problem assessments the things that we value the criteria enough and then be able to dialogue about this solution and not just yes no [1805](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1805.2s)

on that solution but that solution is pretty good for these things but it caused a problem here what if we do this right until you come up with something where everyone's like going ahead with that is better than the other options right and even if i have some compromise the compromise is better than the warfare associated with the non-compromise [1820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1820.48s)

but if we can't get that we're like no  it just no on that we and so we go to a vote rather than bullets then the population will start to polarize along those voting lines increasingly so and then you start getting a situation where whatever somebody does then in the next term the other people are trying to undo and most of the energy goes into internal friction and you just can't do when all the energy goes into internal friction right and this is why the combination of a binary two-party system or a yes no on a proposition system where half of the people will dislike anything combined with a mostly voting and no no real town hall type engagement [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1864.72s)

combined with term limits makes long-term planning almost perfectly impossible um because whatever you're going to implement if it doesn't create its returns within the four years you're not even going to try and you know whatever you do will be undone after those four years and [1885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1885.36s)

you know so um so that's obviously not functional and then and in the business sector it's often an even tighter it's a quarterly time scale um depending upon the nature of the business and if it's private or public um so obviously before we have a proposition that we vote on we should have some process to say what [1908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1908.159s)

would a good proposition be did we even have a process to figure out what is everything that people care about why some people are saying no to this proposition other people saying yes so that we can even do a design process to come up with a good proposition the fact that we go straight to voting on propositions [1924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1924.799s)

that somebody makes up with very partial insights and usually vested interest usually special interest and we don't even have a formalized process for the proposition development like that's so obviously inadequate um and so maybe the bridge that we're going to vote yes or no on the bridge proposal it's like well why does anybody want to make a bridge [1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1948.64s)

and it might just be a construction company wants to make one because they're going to get the contract and it's purely vested interest that just sucks for everybody well that's kind of worth knowing right but if there's a real reason that these two areas are separated enough that it takes two hours for people to commute where it could take 15 minutes and there's an economic situation where it really makes a difference and so then you say okay the underlying need has to do with a particular set of economic needs that are associated with transportation it might be that a bridge is the way to go it might be that because of the negative environmental or aesthetic or whatever effects that that bridge would have that a ferry is a way to go it might be a bridge somewhere else is it might also be that developing the local economies on each side where the people don't have to commute is a way to go there's a lot of other options once you start to understand what are we [1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=1996.399s)

trying to benefit and then what are the adjacent associated things that could be harmed by a particular solution what is this what is the space of things that we care about so you have to do some deeper kind of questioning before you move to proposal process and so one of the things that egp does is get people to really generate the [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2017.679s)

map of relevant things that become the basis for design constraints so then you can do a design by constraint kind of methodology and say what is the best synergistic satisfier we can find and then you have an iterative process on that one of the other things that happens though as far as social cohesion is people don't polarize on other [2037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2037.36s)

people's questions in the same way they polarize on other people's statements and propositions and so if i make a statement that says we should do this someone can instantly have a negative reaction but if someone says you know i question what some of the negative environmental impacts of a bridge might be everyone can be like that's a fair question you know i'm a fisherman i like to fish i don't want to that up too bad or whatever it is right um and so one of the interesting things is that the question asking process inherently can allow dialogue with less intrinsic polarization and people don't have ego [2076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2076.159s)

identified with their questions as much as they have ego identified with their solutions and so it also leads to a binding of a group in a different way and not the cleaving energy for the group there's a bunch of other things that are involved in this that are really interesting it also makes everyone a better sense maker because [2095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2095.599s)

if you ask questions and then the question you ask you have an initial question that a group of people are going to be exploring the first question you ask is what additional questions would have to be addressed to really be able to answer this one well and then what assumptions are built into this question and what is fundamentally [2113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2113.839s)

valuable related to this question that we're trying to understand you get people to actually become better sense makers for their day-to-day life ongoingly plus they get to see other people asking good questions they didn't ask that actually positively gets them to want to perspective seek so there's a lot of badass design built [2131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2131.44s)

into that design process so that's a few things there now i'll answer more on the in a small group of people that i'm hoping to have be deeper or longer-term collaborators less of a society-wide solution what what have i found helpful to get people to collaborate well if there's anything i wish i had better [2159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2159.119s)

answers to it's this uh i can't say that i have had success here anywhere near as well as i wish i can tell you some things that don't work i can tell you a lot of things that don't work um i can tell you some things that seem like they have worked to some degree and then some things i'm hopeful about [2179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2179.28s)

the more you try to have people who say are not engaging because they're being paid and there isn't a command and control hierarchy and they're just authentically coming together to to work together the more you really try to accomplish tangible that way the more you start appreciating [2198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2198.96s)

command and control hierarchy with people that are paid and the ability to replace them with other people that will do a thing because it just is so much  easier and um and it's important to actually come to understand why the thing that has been selected for has been selected for to not just have naive ideas about the [2216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2216.24s)

other things so it's good trying to implement some of the naive ideas and really try to be accountable for the output and watch them fail to then come to understand um specifically one of the things i found so interesting is one of the things that really messes up deep collaboration good faith [2237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2237.52s)

collaboration is optionality um if i've got some poor people who all can't afford to buy their own house and they're all really struggling and they decide to build an intentional community together where the way they do a land co-op actually allows them to someday own something [2258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2258.16s)

and gives them more s like foundational maslow's hierarchy security those people will put up with a decent bit of difficulty from each other and in working with each other to make the thing work because they have a real need that needs met that creates binding energy that overcomes the cleaving energy if i'm trying to do something with [2277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2277.76s)

people that have already been somewhat successful in the world who have the ability to do something at larger scale all of whom don't need the thing to work because they got enough money they can just go somewhere else if it's difficult the privilege and optionality that that creates makes one willing to put up with less [2294](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2294.0s)

difficulty um most of the time so then you have to say okay well how do i bind myself to so um if i got a bunch of people who've all been ceos or could be ceos and they can basically be mostly in control of and they're used to being effective at being in control of [2315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2315.68s)

they and they can recognize that there's an upper bound to what they can do on their own but it's a pretty good upper bound and if they come into relationship with each other they won't have the same control of and they optimized to be good at that for a reason right they psychologically were oriented to be good at that and [2332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2332.4s)

like that and now they're going to have other people that have a very deep say in how the things happen and um and they're just as invested but without as much of a sense of full agency and like that's that's difficult so i have found people trying to do intentional communities or [2348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2348.24s)

collaboratives or whatever um the people that have what seem like higher level capacities to affect change in the world because of what they've already done are some of the people that have the hardest time actually making meaningful sacrifices because they don't feel like they have to [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2370.72s)

um so then someone has to have something that motivates them more than the seeming comfort of their own life and that's a nice idea and it's also hard this is yeah i know you guys had pat ryan on before he probably talked about um blackmail as a currency of [2399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2399.52s)

coordination uh there's always this question when you're trying to coordinate where you're gonna share some knowledge with the people you're going to coordinate with where if that knowledge was widely shared you would lose some of the ability to do the thing because you're going to corner a market opportunity you're going to [2416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2416.319s)

release some patent you're going to you know do a military attack whatever it is where you actually need some element of being able to control the information but you're like the the challenge is if i want to implement something at some scale i have to share some information with some people because i can't do the whole thing myself [2433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2433.359s)

but if i share information with them that and they defect and share that information with the public the police the competitor the whoever it is that totally up what i'm doing somewhere between i get put on a bayonet or in jail or just become a pariah um or lose the market opportunity how do i share the information to allow [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2451.28s)

the coordination and protect against defection and in a government setting it's you know you take an oath you have a commander you violate the confidentiality or the classification and you get thrown in prison right you there's a military prison all that type of thing in rule of law and generally in contract [2472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2472.319s)

law you sign a contract you can get taken to the court the court will enforce it if we're in a gang and this is the mob and you snitch on somebody you're just going to wind up floating in a river right but if we're talking about inter-elite coordination where you can't have the people just wind up in a river [2491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2491.44s)

and you also can't use rule of law because there is no rule of law for the thing that is happening how do you prevent defection and so the idea that having some kind of [[mutually assured destruction]] on each other in the in a space that has power which would be the public sphere which you know would be something like [2509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2509.599s)

blackmail uh that that that can facilitate coordination it's not facilitating trust right it's not facilitating coherence it's facilitating anti-decoherence right or anti-defection but that fundamentally means that it is like the culture is intrinsically right the culture of the thing is not a trust based but a maximally guard against non-trust-based situation so then you have this question to say if we don't have a place where rule of law is the thing that we get to use and we want to create real trust that binds people to to each other and to a mission where they don't defect under duress [2551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2551.04s)

where that would be consequential and we don't want to do it through some form of punishment but what do you do it what creates the binding energy that prevents defection under dress and you know knight hoods had a model for this and of course they sometimes would kill someone for defecting so it wasn't [2571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2571.2s)

without the stick side but the sacred oath where someone actually had a sense of what they were willing to give their life for and that they were actually willing to give their life that there was a transcendental meaningfulness bigger than their life and then they could see that these other people [2586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2586.48s)

authentically took the same oath and so that there was something that they they couldn't defect on each other without defecting on what matters more to them in their own life um and so they have a binding with each other that is actually mediated through whatever the transcendental values are i have some experience of that working [2612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2612.079s)

and i hope to have more experience of that working uh as time goes on um no i don't think it's just enough for everybody to do uh ayahuasca together and have some like nice experience that that feels very deep because the question is how does it hold later under duress um but you know when you study the masons and you study the templar and you study those types of traditions you're actually studying a set of social technologies that was developed very much to do that thing and i would say most the people that are working on how to benefit the world right now are not studying those technologies and what the [2654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2654.64s)

modern applications would be as much as is useful and i would say do think about how people's optionality affects it that's an important thing um there's a lot of things i can say having a culture inside of a group of collaboration where everyone takes more of the responsibility for the [2681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2681.52s)

problems on themselves and gives more of the credit to each other helps a lot like if that's a cultural value that everyone does so rather than have the status competition of your you're like hey you copied my thing or whatever it is i want to actually whenever i'm talking and i'm saying something i learned from [2699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2699.76s)

you if i can credit you and i can help i can help whatever your motivators are where you actually experience the things you're motivated by working better working with me than not um but where that is symmetric right symmetrically that's held as a value and maybe even a vowel i find those things are quite helpful i [2719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2719.839s)

also find not setting them up as vowels up front and just seeing what do people naturally come in with what is the disposition that they hold because if they don't already have that disposition they might not even be able to or want to be bound to it by some agreement so to some degree simply observing where [2737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2737.44s)

people are coming from first and not moving too fast is helpful we could we could talk a long time on this one ryan did you have a follow-up i don't want to take any more of your time that was just really really fun yeah that was that was great uh maybe if you could just talk to [2757](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2757.92s)

embodiment principles or techniques uh not ayahuasca ceremonies that maybe uh help with group coherence i'll share something uh that forest could expand on again um i don't know if people here have how many have basic familiarity with some of the concepts in the eminent metaphysics the domain of the eminent the omniscient [2792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2792.48s)

and the transcendent uh i won't belabor this long as i don't have the time to explain it but if you do have the familiarity there are types of bonding and coherence in each of those domains and one of the things i would say is that it requires bonding in each of the domains so when you say embodiment you're probably mostly talking about [2813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2813.599s)

coherence in the eminent domain and this is this is everything from um a tribal practice of dancing together uh in a drum circle around the fire before making before tribal council and making a decision there's something very profound that happens in that kind of ritual because in the drummers are both doing their own thing and being in sync with each other right they're all kind of following a base rhythm but they're also doing their own thing so there's a balance of agency and communion if they start doing their own thing that is out of beat it'll sound really shitty [2853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2853.68s)

and everyone would be like what are you doing but for them to kind of improv so there's a how do you find individuality in a way that also has harmony and the dancers similarly are all doing their own thing but to a similar beat right so there is a but maybe some are on the half step and [2869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2869.28s)

some are on the double step and the so there is a way that there is harmony between everyone with with individual expression and that that can create an embodied experience of like oh we we have some deeper than semantic level of connectedness and familiarity with each other then we go into the tribal council we're going to talk through [2889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2889.359s)

something and we're bringing in a sense of positive bonding with each other plus coherence with each other right coherence and the eminent whereas coherence in the omniscient in the cognitive would be like logical congruence are we factoring the same data do we have the same waiting algorithms on it are we using the same [2905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2905.76s)

propositional logic um but eminent coherence can also be doing barn raising together which also means build a burning man camp together right the barn raising or the burning man camp is we're experiencing actually working together and you get experience like [2927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2927.28s)

who doesn't actually really work um and who claims a lot of work and didn't who really does how does that kind of fix itself where there is a sense of like oh we're all in this together working supporting each other making the thing happen a real thing happened and there's a experience of a certain kind of coherence that happens from [2943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2943.44s)

building some real together that you don't get from any level of um psycho-emotional bonding group therapy or cognitive work right it's the eminent domain is a different thing um so i would say looking at some kind of uh can we actually work together can we [2968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2968.0s)

find coherence and work together and can we sync together in some kind of fundamental and embodied ways then can we find logical congruence are we running similar axioms and epistemics and in a transcendental way are we oriented to similar values do we have a similar kind of set of [2987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=2987.92s)

transcendental values that we're oriented towards that there need to be some practices in all three of those areas for it to really be effective all right beautiful um and we actually do have forests coming in tomorrow maybe i'll just plug that right now while it's alive at um 3 p.m eastern time margaret and [3010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3010.88s)

myself are going to have a discussion with him on the ephemeral group process so that's pretty cool and also that blackmail guy pat ryan uh he's going to be in this friday for another session of the dark stoa so check that out um a question uh from kerry above on the ethics of a vegan diet uh if you [3031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3031.2s)

can meet yourself and ask your question i copied and pasted right here in the chats hey danielle thank you um so i heard you speak uh in an interview i think it was about six years ago on the ethics of a vegan diet um i'm a nutritionist and so i've thought about food quite extensively for [3054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3054.4s)

20 years or so um so it's interesting to me because diet seems to be at the intersection of personal choice and personal impact and community global and civilizational impact uh with 2.6 million years of human species eating meat it seems like we carry a biological imperative to some amount of animal for our best [3076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3076.8s)

health um and i heard you speak something about like acts thinking about it really carefully and educating oneself on how to eat a vegan diet well and algaes and different things but i see accessing these things is somewhat challenging not practical for everyone potentially even privileged um so how [3099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3099.599s)

can we move out of the nightmare of the commodification of animals but still meet our omnivorous needs this this is one of the trickier topics um i kind of wish that you didn't bring it up because it's very hard to feel like we can do any justice to it in a short amount of time [3126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3126.0s)

because the science itself is actually very complex in the formal sense of the word complex meaning what metrics do i pick to measure health and which of those are differentially benefited more by different diets and did i control properly did i control for other environmental factors and con commitment factors and genetics [3148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3148.8s)

and and so you'll have a china study and then you'll have a refute to china study and then you'll have an atkins study and then you'll have a and while i have seen some comparative nutritionists try to look across those data sets and compare them well i have not seen epistemics that i [3166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3166.72s)

consider adequate to the [[problem space]] yet so when we're talking about ethics obviously there's going to be a what is actually possible and what is actually true objectively that is going to be a part of that if if people really can be fully healthy without eating animal products or they [3190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3190.64s)

can't be the ethics of it is totally different right and then you have things like short term versus long term and how long did the study run for and does it you know change over time and and different genetic backgrounds and microbiomes and whatever and so i think the complexity of the [3209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3209.839s)

sciences is trickier than almost anyone i've ever talked to acknowledges because like people coming to the issue of race they come from either that they've been absorbed in critical race theory in the associated histories or the almost opposite kind of the social [3228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3228.24s)

science and so the preponderance of what they've been exposed to makes them feel more certain and the view that they've had of the other side is usually their side debunking the other side and so to the degree that a topic is polarized is the degree to which even if people are familiar with both sides it's through bias that they don't recognize [3246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3246.0s)

that's really tricky and i think the way we feed ourselves is so primal right like one two three five times a day i'm gonna be doing this thing so somebody telling me how i should or shouldn't feed myself and it goes against my culture my early childhood my sense of sovereignty my [3266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3266.64s)

like it's such a big thing and and on the same time the it's kind of the thermodynamic basis of our impact on the planet right as a species is that thing and there's so many of us that the the net collective consequence of it is so important to consider where you can't take a purely individualistic approach without kant's [3286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3286.96s)

categorical imperative does this work for everybody and so i think it's just an authentically tricky topic so i will share a couple high-level considerations so i became a vegetarian when i was a kid when i was nine um saw a factory farming truck it was a kind of horrific scene [3314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3314.559s)

red diet for a new america got into pita and animal activism and like that and then when i was a teenager became vegan i just hadn't studied the dairy part yet and i i have been up until now i'm 40. and i'm you know my blood labs look good i lift weights you know i i'm in good health my energy is good so [3341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3341.839s)

uh that works for me and i have tested at different times to see am i missing something where i don't have a good reference so let me take a you know some small amount for a period of time uh eggs or whatever it is that would be the test of the nutrient i might be missing and see do i notice a real subjective [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3364.4s)

difference i'm gonna have a very hard time noticing an object of difference especially when the blood labs are already in a good range and i personally have not noticed a difference and i have noticed many people who have and i've known a number of people who have tried to do [3385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3385.92s)

uh vegan diets and were much healthier for some period of time oftentimes because it was the first diet that they did really thoughtfully so it meant that they just cut out a bunch of refined food and grains and whatever i find that actually most any diet works for somebody at first if it is basically a movement from [3405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3405.359s)

something like shitty unconscious standard american diet that if it's in the direction of cleaner more whole foods more organic whether the macros are mostly fats mostly protein are mostly carbs they're going to do better than they did on the like sugar and hydrogenated fat diet and usually any of them that they go to [3424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3424.16s)

they'll have some more consideration of calories and micronutrients and some basic things like that i find that there's a lot of diets that people do well on for a short period and then badly on like too long on keto or too long on adkins or for some people too long on vegan or for most people too long on fruitarian [3442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3442.4s)

where the imbalance in macros and the associated imbalance and micronutrients that go with it end up becoming not good long-term fits i think realizing that most people in our [[evolutionary environment|evolutionary environments]] didn't have access to the same type of food all year round before agriculture makes it pretty clear that dietary [3462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3462.16s)

flexibility is the thing that was our primary [[evolutionary environment]] so we would have had some times where there was more animal products less animal product different kinds of uh vegetation but never like as much salary as we want all year round or as much you know like that just that's a that's a weird thing and so i think that creates [3485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3485.2s)

metabolic inflexibility microbiomic inflexibility things like that i think as far as the ethics goes i don't think that anyone puts forward a reasonable case for why [[factory farm|factory farms]] are a good idea or an ethically reasonable idea ethically environmentally health-wise or any other [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3507.44s)

wise i think it's one of the like obvious great blights on the world and one of the things that i'm i get sad about so i have friends that are vegan for ethical reasons and i have friends that are hunters for ethical reasons both of whom i respect because they're if they're in a real earnest inquiry around what is true what [3529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3529.839s)

is effective how does their choice how would it portend for eight billion people doing that if they're really in it i don't think that anyone can claim the basis of authority to say you have to come to this conclusion or you're a bad person uh so i mostly care about the depth of earnestness within with which one is inquiring and [3551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3551.04s)

practicing but sometimes i will see people go from say a vegetarian conversation to a a conversation where it ethically makes sense to eat animal products for them because they think that we can't get heme iron or b12 or [[evolutionary environment]] of omnivore or whatever it is they have some [3572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3572.0s)

argument like that that would justify going in bow hunting or something but because of that they just slide to animals or in rather than out and they'll eat mcdonald's and i think that is super sloppy ethically right so how much meat does somebody need to eat if they feel that they need to eat some and how was it [3592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3592.799s)

sourced is really important not just a binary it's all in or it's all out right i think if someone has endeavored to apply a vegan diet well and they have tried to study the nutrition of it and they don't feel that they can be as healthy then there's a very [3618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3618.24s)

straightforward ethical conversation around it's not causing unnecessary suffering to kill some other life because they are in some ongoing degree of suffering by not doing it so now we're weighing sufferings and now we're in an in a authentically difficult trolley problem [3636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3636.079s)

right but we're in a real ethical problem as opposed to just a black and white it was unnecessary suffering for no good reason um of course there are heaps of questions under this around but how do we know what the [[subjective experience]] or consciousness of an animal is compared to a plant and i address some of those in that dialogue [3654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3654.4s)

that you saw and that takes a little while um and i i wouldn't consider the same type of proto-qualia for a blade of wheatgrass as i would for a redwood tree like i think those types of categories are also nonsense um or obviously for a clam as for a chimpanzee in the domain of animal um when we think about when we think about the fundamental principles of ethics one of the uh this again a lot of things forest did a very good job formalizing the ethics of continuity and the ethics of symmetry is a really nice formal our way of framing up ethics writ large ethics of symmetry is one of the main ways we think about ethics [3706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3706.0s)

which is do unto others as you would have them do unto you or um rawls is original position right you design a society but you don't know which of the roles you're going to be put into and design a society in a way where you'd be okay being put into any of the roles and make sure that if you design a deal with somebody that you'd be willing to [3728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3728.559s)

take any side of the deal um pie slice theorem i can slice the pie but you get a pick or you can slice it and i pick but i don't get a slice and pick so these are ethics of symmetry would i trade places do i actually feel that the thing i'm dealing is fair not in a sense but the embodied [3746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3746.88s)

sense i trade places so if we extend that to animals as sentient creatures and say would i trade places here if people aren't asking that question i don't think they have contemplated the ethics yet and and asking the way we design a system for say a species right cows or chickens in [3772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3772.319s)

relationship to humans from rawls's point of view would i be willing to be put into the cow place there or in the human place and say like that's actually a reasonable position or did i design something were there positions i totally wouldn't want to be put into it's some form of um you know what we would consider abject slavery or something like that [3790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3790.72s)

so i think thinking through that is important and so the hunters that i respect have a complex relationship with killing every time like they have some basis by which they feel like that is actually you know there's too many deer in the area because we've killed the [[apex predator|apex predators]] in the area they're actually helping to balance the environment getting that there as opposed to [[factory farm]] meat is better even as opposed to agriculture that's coming through conventional agriculture producing wheat that is you know destroyed whole forest lands that that feels like the right thing to do but it also doesn't feel like nothing to [3834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3834.0s)

them to kill the animal knowing that what that animal is experiencing is a real experience and what the other animals that were part of that hurt or whatever are experiencing watching it and even more so if i raised it my whole life right and then the thing shifts so i think someone's relationship with it should be complex right like i think if it's really simple it's because someone has actually stopped wrestling with the wholeness of it and if you look at most of the kind of tribal cultures they had a very strong no waste orientation right they didn't take more than they needed and so in a situation where it's like [3872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3872.319s)

we're talking about health but then most people are obese on the thing no that's up right um does it make sense to take it from much worse sources and more than is needed in a way that's actually harming me not helping me no that's ethically up i don't hold that everyone sh necessarily can or should be vegan i [3891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3891.68s)

hope that some people can i don't hold that no no one can from experience of a lot of long-term people are quite healthy um i hold that everyone can be much more responsible with their choices and you know like also i i try very very hard not to buy plant products that come from [3917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3917.839s)

conventional sources that had damaging effects on the environment in the nature of how the conventional agriculture works so it's not that's another binary that people do of like meats in so i'll take the [[factory farm]] stuff or i don't do meat so whatever plants i do are fine no no like the the the glyphosate wheat [3934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3934.72s)

that is up the environment or whatever is actually really bad um and kills lots of animals and the nature of how those threshers work and the you know field mice and snakes and birds and pollinators and whatever um i think it's hard for us when we're dealing with very large [[supply chain|supply chains]] that we're emotionally disconnected from whereas if i was growing all of my own food picking picking a carrot just doesn't feel the same as slitting a goat's throat they don't feel like the same kind of experience and there's a there's something that goes with being connected to that whole thing [3971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3971.119s)

and honestly picking a carrot or wild harvesting a berry doesn't feel the same as clear cutting an area of forest to create row agriculture does right and so to try to take these very large-scale things that are invisible to us like go to the [[factory farm]] go to the conventional farm go to where clear [3995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=3995.44s)

cutting's happening go to the landfill and really get in touch with what your life is producing and then say how do i actually take better responsibility for this now one can go excessive here and try to have not causing harm be the whole thing they focus on their life will just get smaller and smaller [4013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4013.28s)

because they actually realize if i drive on the road i'm causing an electric car versus a gas car my bike the rubber where'd it come from though and so that can just shrink you into there is no way to have your hands totally clean in a world that is built on institutional violence right like it is institutional structural violence [4034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4034.48s)

so there's a certain place where i am complicit by being in it it's a kind of ethical humility that has to happen but then to also say i'm going to minimize those harms while also maximizing my capacity to change it and if i'll never fly on a plane because of the [[climate change]] but that also means i can't go [4051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4051.359s)

possibly influence the thing at the un or wherever it is that i got invited to do then i might be causing less harm in the moment but decreasing my capacity for a larger offset but then again that doesn't just mean well i don't think about plane flights at all and i will do infinite amounts of them because i got put into the binary [4067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4067.44s)

category called plane flights are cool so i how to really take responsibility for the things that i'm affecting but i can't tell i'm affecting right i can't tell because they're out of my senses that's the deeper consideration i would offer any follow-up question carrie no that [4086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4086.88s)

was uh really excellent thank you i live at a [[regenerative agriculture]] eco village and um sitting with potentially uh exploring this complex relationship and killing a chicken and so that really was wonderful thank you all right i'll say one more thing about [4109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4109.92s)

that when i was a kid i uh really just loved animals and took in all the sick and injured animals i could find in our house became kind of like a animal rehab place for some time and that also meant that there were animals that weren't going to get better that were really suffering that we had to kill put out of ongoing unnecessary [4132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4132.88s)

suffering so starting somewhat young i learned how to mercifully kill something that i was dedicated to trying to save right that i cared about and that's a very interesting process right vets obviously have to go through that and typically one desensitizes when they do too much of it [4152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4152.88s)

because like think about someone who became a vet because they love animals and now they're in a situation where they're just euthanizing beautiful dogs all day long because people are and breed dogs and they shouldn't um like how do you not shut down and so i had a process that every time i [4168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4168.96s)

killed an animal i i was completely tuned in with it right i was feeling it i was loving it i was wishing that i had been able to help it more and i cried every time right but i also wouldn't not do it because it needed done so like you have to both have the courage and the sensitivity bound [4188](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4188.96s)

and if you go on either side where you don't have the courage or the sensitivity you kind of fall off the razor's edge there so when you have that experience with the chicken and the community does that they really just feel and hold the whole thing thank you yeah all right we have 15 minutes left so um we'll sneak in this question from evan and then we'll close up uh evan i pasted your question below if you can unmute yourself and ask it to daniel yeah thank you so um i think a lot of people on the stoa might be in a similar spot to me here and so i'm going to ask this question [4231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4231.679s)

kind of generally um so a lot of us want to spend more of our time and energy helping to actualize the sort of non-rival risk systems and dynamics of the future that you talk about and um but are also in a situation where we will be literally homeless if we don't keep our day jobs within a month or two um and these day jobs require us to [4250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4250.88s)

spend our time in a game a or rivalrous kind of context and um so i i would just love to hear your take on how one can actually make moves in one's life to um to move into a way of making one's way in the world for oneself and one's family making a living in the world um without being so deeply attached and dependent on these sort of um you know rivalrous game a corporate dynamics that that most of us have to spend you know eight hours a day doing yeah i get it the best answer i have isn't awesome so things that i did one was for most of my life i kept my [4303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4303.28s)

overhead extremely low and so i did life design that made it to where i wasn't on the hamster wheel of you know make a little bit more and then want to spend a little bit more on all the things that society makes it very easy to want to spend it on that then binds me to that thing because i was very clear that i was trying to [4326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4326.4s)

liberate my time and then i sought what are the ways that i can make more dollars per hour doing things that i believe are good even if they're not the very best things because i'm not trying to get my sense of how my theory of change in the world is going to ever give me dollars maybe it [4345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4345.6s)

will but i i'm not connected to that i'm not going to do something high dollar power that i think is really bad um so when i was doing construction as a kid going through college i remember seeing that uh the electricians made more than people framing and i was framing so i taught myself electrical work and then [4364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4364.56s)

started doing that right like i just kept seeing how do i increase the dollars per hour to not increase the total dollars but to decrease the hours while keeping the dollar needs more fixed and you know then i was doing counseling work with people and then i learned that doing executive [4381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4381.84s)

coaching was basically counseling that charged more and then i learned that strategic business consulting for businesses made more than the executive coaching thing did it was like what skills would i need to develop to actually be able to help here that are also teaching me something interesting and valuable [4396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4396.159s)

and then how do i progressively keep the hours lower where the rest of my hours get to keep growing and know that it won't happen that instantly like the development of right profession is as you know it's a developmental process years uh and if someone now i mostly never had a job like a w-2 type thing i mostly took contractor type [4421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4421.36s)

positions where i could control the dynamics of my hours and charge and like that better not not everyone is oriented to do that as well if you're in an eight-hour position uh and you don't know how to make more dollars per hour in some obvious way and obviously taking the time to explore how to do that is time outside of those [4443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4443.44s)

eight hours that you're not trying to figure out anti-rivalrous stuff with um a few things i would say the people who were under feudalism for most of the history of the world could never ask this question like they didn't have eight hours and then some free time and some access to knowledge and development [4471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4471.28s)

uh or even the freedom that if they economically freed themselves they weren't forced into some position like it is even to be in what seems like economic servitude here have no money in savings and be you know a month away from homeless but to not be working 12 or 14 hours obligately a day [4490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4490.96s)

um is actually a situation that allows us an upward vector that most people never had and most people in the world still don't have now to say but i'm tired at the end of eight hours and you know i i want i like i need to chill or rest or do something else that's real and the depth to which we care about it can motivate [4512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4512.56s)

finding more energy now one of the tricky things is like what resource do you focus on first to be able to leverage other resources do i just really double down and focus on money making so i can buy free time and fun projects or am i gonna really try to focus on my health so i have more energy so i can work 15 hours a day [4533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4533.6s)

and so i've got a solid seven outside of the eight that i work but i'm gonna put some energy into health to have like the physical vitality to do that am i gonna try to double down on my learning straight towards you know [[game b]] type things i've never found a good answer of like the order of operations is really figure [4551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4551.12s)

out discipline first and then figure out money i found that it's like you level them all up one notch and you kind of take a moment you level them all up one notch and then you level them all up one notch again and um and it's very easy to focus on how we wish it was that it isn't in a way that [4569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4569.6s)

is disempowering that just makes us feel kind of shitty but to focus on i just don't find that a useful focus to focus on that we actually have some developmental opportunity and development happening and then just keep saying how do i double down on that is the most useful focus and then i would say like to the degree [4590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4590.239s)

you're in those eight hours a day can you experiment with [[game b]] type things can you even learn more about game a by bringing like not just being there kind of disengaged but saying i'm going to move up through the ranks here and learn how business really works i'm going to learn more about middleman and i'm going to learn those things [4607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4607.92s)

to just bring more like care and engagement to your learning and development i think can happen most anywhere when you realize everything's interconnected then you realize that any domain of learning can be laterally applied to almost everything else um yep those are a few thoughts so quick [4632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4632.32s)

follow-up if i may um so i i like what you had to say um i spent most of my 20s uh learning and being only occasionally employed in a more contractor-type basis like you described now i'm employed in a well currently in an engineering type role and i'm starting to feel a pull to not do that and i remember you said in [4656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4656.56s)

one of these earlier stoa sessions that most people should probably have a job rather than work for themselves so i'm wondering specifically focusing on like how does one decide um or what is your advice for someone who is in the process of deciding whether or not to continue with a pretty good job for a pretty good company [4674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4674.159s)

that's making the world at least marginally better versus to strike out on one's own and accept the much greater levels of uncertainty precarious and risk in the service of trying to actualize something that you feel that you've discovered in your heart and want to share i won't answer this the same for [4691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4691.52s)

everybody because i think i'll i think a lot of people kind of mostly just want to live a good life and they would like to leave the world somewhat better than they found it but they're not hugely aspirational or ambitious about that and that's okay i think that has always [4709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4709.12s)

and will maybe always be the case that that's where most people are and so have a job that is doing something somewhat good and also allows some free time and some development is probably great if you are possessed by a need to solve problems [4734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4734.08s)

that you can't not solve then it's a different answer in which case i would say i would take a job if and only if there was really strong developmental opportunity in it but not just to maintain myself in my life but if i had the opportunity to either learn a  ton you're an engineer and you get [4761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4761.84s)

to work with some of the best engineers in the world and your software skills get to become epic which can really help future in which case when i'm there i wouldn't stay eight hours i'd say 12 hours picking those guys brain doing additional and trying to learn everything i could right i would actually take the developmental [4775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4775.28s)

opportunity or you have the ability to not just perfect your craft but adjacent areas you can move up in management and other things and learn how businesses work so that you might be able to either launch something or understand the intrinsic problems associated with them or [4790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4790.4s)

you can grow your network there a lot if there's very real return on your time in a developmental way then even if the project itself's output is not all of what you care about but it's increasing your capacity to do the things you care about in the future good um if it's not i would rather [4815](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4815.76s)

get a van be homeless decrease my costs figure out how to do a little bit of gig consulting and find something better and get off the hamster wheel thank you yeah all right um we're gonna land here daniel any closing thoughts um like anything that came alive from this session or the series [4839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4839.28s)

as a whole i really liked all these questions uh some of the questions like i said i wish we didn't ask the diet one because i because i wish we had i don't know 10 hours to start to address it um but it's actually one of the most important questions and base of like how do we take care of [4867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4867.6s)

ourselves as a human and what's the impact of that and how do we think through that um and how do we come up with our own ethics that we care about so much we're willing to modify our own life without trying to force that on everyone else and how do we feel okay not forcing it on everyone [4882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4882.239s)

else if we're so sure it's right we're willing to sacrifice for it that's a microcosm of how to deal with israel-palestine and shiite chuni and every other major  like that in the world so um yeah and the question of like how do i take care of my financial needs in the world while wanting to contribute to something else like these [4902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4902.8s)

are all i think every one of these are questions that all of us have to wrestle with and how do we live in this world while trying to move it towards a better world and so i'm hoping that the questions that other people asked other people found interesting and meaningful um i would love to hear if people you [4926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4926.0s)

know want to write feedback afterwards of what was uh what was both good in this process for you and what could have made it better format wise or anything else because uh yeah i i don't get to talk with people about these types of things very often i enjoyed this and would be quite happy to do more of it in a better you know in an even better setting if such a thing became clear uh so feel free to put um in the chats what you got from it maybe daniel could check it out um and i'm inspired to because we're going to launch a metagame mastermind here at stowe again and we're going to have crews where we help each other out [4974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4974.32s)

kind of source the [[collective intelligence]] to answer these questions um so we don't just rely on the guests coming in to to drop their knowledge but uh very grateful for you my friend for coming and sharing your knowledge and wisdoms with us i would love to have you back you may or may not be [4990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=4990.96s)

uh coming in a couple weeks we won't say anything about that but um thank you so much for coming to the store likewise thank you peter uh gonna plug uh some events uh we got a fun one this wednesday uh the problem with the [[sensemaking]] scene imagining beyond the uh [5008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5008.4s)

echo chamber this is with ellie hayne and tarn rogers john so these are two insiders of the sense maker scene and they're going to critique it so that should be quite fun and i got exciting something exciting to announce so i'm going to share my screen um boom it is maybe not the end of the world election party [5030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5030.639s)

november 3rd 24 hour event uh we got wim hof stoic breath trainer we got election meditation collective presence in shame breakthrough boot camp uh socratic speed dating existential dance party rap on battle and many more jazzy titles for you to enjoy that's gonna be posted tonight on the stowa website [5050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5050.56s)

uh let me stop here i will drop those links um there's gonna be a 24 hour zoom or discord channel too that we can all chat on to process the craziness so i'm going to take in before we're going to bio break we're going to have a rap on battles now so some of you might be here for it but [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5071.12s)

if not i'll take in tyson and tyson if you can give it a quick plug before we go on a break sure thank you yes wrap on battles is a space for us to practice freestyle rap and spoken word all right as a way of engaging in a collective inquiry and practicing dialectic and ultimately building communitas and it is open to [5090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5090.719s)

all participants and spectators even if you don't rap or never rap before that's a little intimidating you are welcome to come and play in this space and i look forward to seeing you here in a few minutes beautiful all right so uh thank you again daniel everyone for coming to the stoa [5107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-GlhLQdY0&t=5107.92s)

uh we'll go on a play some music if you want to leave right now you can if you want to hang out to check out rap on battles feel free to do that but we will take a turn off the recording now
