[[music]] welcome to nov this evening um my name is anna and we have daniel and johanna made the soup and this is shastin and yeah we're very excited to have you all here and of course daniel nate and nora we have a lot of people on youtube watching this now and we also have two knob hubs for the first time you can see them there um yeah so i will hand over to you so i will just be a kind of frame holder i will not have any other function than actually in the break uh when we have listened we're gonna invite you to talk a little bit to be able to maybe give [65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=65.519s)

some reflections back to you that you can at the the dialogue can grasp some of what is happening inside you but otherwise i don't think that these three people really need an introduction or we will not do that because i feel you will absolutely talk for yourself but we have max koshford [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=89.96s)

so who will the bring us some [[music]] first welcome and welcome all three of you applause yeah so i will nora asked me this this morning can you play and i said okay but i i thought so this is a sweden [120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=120.84s)

meeting um america again so i'm gonna play one swedish folk [[music]] now a swedish blues from the 16 1700s and later on i'll do the american one okay enjoy [[music]] [[music]] [[music]] foreign [[music]] foreign [[music]] applause thank you i'm super happy to be here with you nate higgins is here with us as well [264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=264.6s)

tonight all of these wonderful souls are also joining us on this adventure that we're about to go on um i'm so glad we started with a piece of [[music]] that was amazing yeah thank you matsukor fort my beloved husband it's beautiful um the arc of the evening or the morning wherever you are in the world um is going to be that we're going to do the first chunk of time and i'm definitively not giving a number to that it's a chunk whatever the chunk needs to be it shall be um daniel and i will [320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=320.1s)

be in conversation and then uh nate higgins is going to join us and bring some of his reflections what comes up for you while we're wandering and then we'll take a little break and let you all have some time to think about what has come up and then we will have some time for you [346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=346.86s)

to be for us to all be in conversation together in the room so that's that's where we're going tonight and i hope that sounds good to all of you so let's begin it's hard to know where the beginning is this sort of thing um i think one thing that i would like to start with is [376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=376.38s)

the recognition that our institutions and the structures that our societies are held within um are not prepared and are not prepared to be prepared to respond to the needs of the people in the way that is needed [403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=403.8s)

this is true not only with health services or with defense services or with food services or with um mental health services economic services etc we've seen several events just in the few last few months where uh fires in maui or floods in libya or earthquakes in morocco or run away um disinformation algorithms uh the opioid crisis etc where there wasn't the capability of the existing systems to actually respond in the work that i've been doing with [456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=456.06s)

warm data one of the things that i've been most concerned with is how to make it possible for people to be there for each other and what does that mean what would that take because you can't tell people to be respectful of each other you can't tell people they have to help each other you can't mandate that [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=485.099s)

you can't send them to a class for this is how you do this because they don't know what they're going to be facing the main thing is can they learn together can they can they meet chaos together how do we meet chaos together with as much love and care and grace [511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=511.02s)

and creativity improvisation as possible so that's where i thought we would start and you sent me this great message from the car so i'm really looking forward to hearing what you're going to say i just sent the message that she's going to get to meet a very fevered version of my brain uh tonight because i can you guys hear me with this i am i'm actually quite ill but the tylenol is hiding it i canceled everything yesterday and today with the exception of this but i didn't want to cancel this because um last time i was here this was the community that i felt most connected to in sweden it felt like there were a lot [564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=564.12s)

of people here really earnestly trying to do the most important work they could pella i met last time is working on making eco side an actual crime against humanity at the icc it's like an incredible project there are people here working at on [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and uh and so i really wanted to be with everybody and i just want to apologize [589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=589.68s)

for not being all that coherent tonight and for not being here early to get to greet and talk with everybody and i probably won't be able to stay late but i i wanted to show up i would also say take everything i say with extra grains of salt tonight you were saying how do we be with chaos together and we're gonna get a chance to find out soon [614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=614.279s)

and you were saying that the institutions aren't prepared to handle it and i would say the the most powerful institutions that run the world are criminally insane it's not just that they're not prepared to handle it or they're slightly antiquated i don't think we've had a war in a long time at least since world war ii that the u.s [639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=639.24s)

has been involved in that wasn't a false flag war we know that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq but we actually know that cheney and rumsfeld knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq and four and a half million people were murdered as a result of the activities that started and the banks and financial services [661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=661.44s)

groups that require exponentiation of the monetary supply venusifying the planet and uh driving [[biodiversity loss]] and all those things like this is not just unprepared to deal with the moment this is suicidal omnicidal criminally insane and yeah that's it so what was on my mind is [688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=688.5s)

that there's a cognitive dissonance because when the things that are threatening global [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are mostly invisible you can't see them they're hyper objects you can't see [[climate change]] you can see weather but there was always weather but to know that the extreme weather is statistically worse and worsening you have to do math and you can question the [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=712.56s)

math if you don't know how to do the math properly and you can't see [[species extinction]] and you can't see the rate of ai growth and you can't see synthetic bios total vulnerability landscape all of these are radical abstractions of complexities and what you see looks pretty fine in fact it looks more convenient than ever amazon just delivers stuff to your [739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=739.44s)

door and so in the past when a civilization would face a [[catastrophic risk]] it was either because there was a eminent natural disaster coming that everybody saw or there was war coming that everybody saw and in that place people were ready to mobilize in the presence of an attacking army you stopped focusing [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=761.279s)

on quality of life and competing with the neighbors and started focusing on survival right now what is at risk is radically more than all previous catastrophic events combined and it's invisible and so there's this cognitive dissonance if we actually need to be in something much more like wartime mentality but everything looks fine and then [788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=788.76s)

people will say you know don't you need work-life balance and like that that is totally not cognizant of the actual world we're in and there are a lot of i think people who are not necessarily uh criminally evil working inside these institutions at the bottom teachers doctors um people working in various parts of [824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=824.399s)

the you know the system that are trying believing they're trying to help people in some way and are earnestly doing their best and they can't so this is something that i see all the time is that if if you're talking about um well you can start anywhere and the issue is never just one thing [851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=851.639s)

so you end up with somebody who is suffering from a diagnosis of some mental health thing and you figure out that well there's also there's also a lack of food and there's also a lack of family and there's also all sorts of other things that are happening in in that that are producing these symptoms that are consequences of many [[complex system|complex systems]] coming together and i would suggest that probably in this room there's not very many people who don't have some kind of crisis in their life um and and how do we actually get through the day together continuing to keep life as usual going when life is usual is is deadly but stopping is also deadly that this is the double blind [913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=913.8s)

um if you if you if we stop all this these systems then we don't have work we don't have money we don't have big ag we don't have big pharma we don't have all of these these functional institutional processes we can't do that but if we keep them going we're like lemmings um and they're in contradiction [941](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=941.1s)

so um in many cases if you're dealing with you know a teenager at risk that's going to be story of a legal crisis through the eyes of the law is this is this person behaving according to the law or not according to the law in in terms of the education system that this person is defined in terms of [967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=967.26s)

how are they doing in school what are their grades and what is their class behavior in terms of their technological usage we can see what where they've been surfing around their family sees perhaps how they're different how they're behaving differently than than the father or the mother did when they were young but who saw the kid [988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=988.74s)

so there's a perception also of the complexity um that leads us to responses that enhance the problems that we're in if we're responding to one fragment at a time we end up creating responses that are also within the logic of that [1017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1017.18s)

fragmentation and that's the key it's the logic itself of that that is so you can't just make a quick fix well we'll just have a systemic approach to this and this is what it's going to look like because likely even in the thinking of the systemic approach is the logic [1037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1037.76s)

of perpetuation yeah i don't think there really are any problems in the world we we talk about the distinction between problems and predicaments or problems and wicked problems or whatever problems admit a uh full solution and i think that those mostly don't exist outside a very narrow [1066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1066.799s)

engineering applications and the way we define problems is at the heart of all the problems we create because the problem is too much co2 in the atmosphere so we can create an approach to sequester co2 that involves putting more nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into waterways or an approach to uh you know there are so [1096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1096.08s)

many ways to solve a particular problem and end up externalizing harm to other areas and who's in general when we think about the way we define a problem we define a problem where the solution is going to be measurable so we can assess if we're on track or not with a small number of metrics or kpis and [1121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1121.34s)

where the effect of how we're trying to solve the problem is usually a first order effect we're creating a technology or a law or a business to have a first order effect on a small number of variables but it'll also whatever we create will have a second and third and fourth order effects on a very large number of unknown variables so it is [1143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1143.36s)

epistemologically harder to ensure that you aren't causing problems in a lot of other areas than it is to just look at how to solve that narrow problem so sometimes people say to me that they have ideas and i and they're excited about their idea and then i say here's the types of harm that are likely to come from them doing that that's agency [1165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1165.919s)

damaging and i'm okay being agency damaging if it would be like foreign the ai risk right now is mostly being accelerated by the companies that were created to solve ai risk right deep mind was further ahead in ai so open ai was created to try to solve ai risk and then open the eye is the one [1191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1191.0s)

that takes it to market after getting acquired by microsoft and getting forced to do so and then anthropic broke off from open ai to be more focused on ai risk and then took 300 million from google and now there's a full-on commercial [[arms race]] advancing ai as fast as possible where the ones at the front were the ones supposedly trying to solve the problem and that's mostly the nature of how it works so if humanity just stopped that would be much better and so i want people to feel a sense of agency of how to move forward but a sense that acknowledges the real complexity of things which means that you have to look at for whatever problem you're trying to address what are all [1238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1238.039s)

the upstream causes of that what are all the [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] what are all the externalities of institutional choice making architectures what are all the social traps at play what are all the mindsets at play what is the rest of the technological ecosystem driving that thing and if you if it's expressing as this thing and you remove that thing does it just express [1259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1259.16s)

somewhere else and then if you change this thing what are all the downstream effects of that um so there's a certain kind of meta agency that is how to not feel agency because you feel confused and overwhelmed but to stay with it and to keep trying to learn more until you come to a place where some clarity emerges that's not [1283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1283.46s)

the agency if i know what to do but it's the agency if i care enough that i can't do anything other than inquire about what might be worth doing until something comes clear i'm so glad to hear you say that because i think there's a fear that if we somehow create [[music]] um if if complexity and contextual process turns into determinism that you that there will be some loss of free will and that there will be this agency vacuum and and really what's lost there is a sense of morale is a sense of of membership and participation um that could be potentially replaced [1331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1331.4s)

with a despair and and apathy even um but one thing that i have uh found in my own work is that the more people are able to perceive contextual and transcontextual process which sounds complex but actually it's easier than you think um the more there is this other kind of agency that steps in that comes in and it's agency not to to first order action it's agency to enth order action and it looks so different it looks almost incoherent because it isn't a response that looks like the problem it's not matching the problem it's meeting the problem [1388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1388.4s)

and that meeting is a of a totally different order and aesthetic and cadence of response um i have met a few people in my life who were just very good at that um and many people who like myself who keep trying it's a practice though it's it's really a practice it's a it's a it's recognizing whatever it is that [1416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1416.78s)

comes up in front of you that you're facing no matter how you know it's some issue at home or some issue with your partner or or big global issues that there's much more happening around it and that practice of just every time recognizing i'm not going to be seduced by the alarm bells of this very exciting moment whether i'm angry or thrilled or [1441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1441.5s)

in love or whatever it is i'm going to i'm going to like you said take the time pay attention to what's going on around behind what are the mindsets there's so many ghosts moving through us um ghosts of [1467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1467.12s)

this is how it is this is one of the most seductive ideas this is how it is and once you get caught in the this is how it is this it's very difficult to talk yourself out of it to see another is and we have to get our kids to school because they've got us go to school [1495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1495.86s)

because they've got to get jobs because they got to take part in the system because this is how it is or whatever else there's a million versions we have to win the [[arms race]] because if we don't build the weapon we'll lose and they're building the weapon and we have to provide this much irr to the if we want to do impact to the investors [1517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1517.52s)

because otherwise we won't have enough money to do anything meaningful and um i had a friend just the other day who was proposing that we make a public-private partnership to solve the ai synthetic bio issue where the companies themselves that are advancing the synthetic bio ai technology are the ones that write the legislation to bind themselves [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1540.14s)

and i'm like are you kidding like are you being honest that you really are proposing this and he's like well that's how it works in dc you always have revolving doors and i'm like that's why we're going to go extinct and but that's how it is that's how it is and that's how it is in the [[world system]] the human-made [[world system]] is on a eminent in your lifetime extinction path [1562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1562.34s)

so learning the how biology is and how physics is and how ecology is and figuring out how to change the [[world system]] the criminally insane [[world system]] to be compatible with it is the only chance for there to be and is at all for humans continuing i want to plug something real quick um how many people here have done nora's warm data well not as many as i would have thought maybe a third okay um you know in the delta ching it says in the practice of the dao every day something has dropped in the acquisition of knowledge every day something is gained and those don't [1611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1611.36s)

have to be incompatible they can actually [[dance]] together and i see that what nora figured out how to do with warm data was really the [[dance]] between those where someone is dropping the rigid ways of seeing things while learning to see things a lot more ways so they have a lot more complexity with less certainty at the same time right they're dropping certainty [1636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1636.26s)

but they're getting lots of new insights which means there's a lot of new possibilities through what had seemed impossible and one of the things that's so interesting about it is that it looks like a elementary school activity it looks like some really benign thing and but when she asks what is [[music]] in the context of uh the financial media production industry or what is [[music]] in the context of culture or what is [[music]] in the context of healing or what is [[music]] in the context of family or what is [[music]] in the context of death ritual and someone gets to think wow it's so many different things they stop thinking what is [[music]] is a reasonable concept it's in what contexts and across enough different things they stop thinking of anything as a static thing and thinking of everything as something embedded in lots of different contexts which means there have to be lots of different ways to see anything or you're just radically reducing the world [1700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1700.96s)

so i will admit that i would like i will admit that i think we're probably going to fail as a species pretty soon and that i would like that not to happen and for it not to happen uh i would like a really intense call to action where [1733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1733.159s)

people stop being comfortable and focusing on the that they normally focus on i would love to see stockholm have something that is like extinction rebellion is the right type of framing right um if you are working on the most important thing you know to serve some aspect of [1752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1752.9s)

the continuity and thriving of life i would like you to just deepen your passion for that and your skills at it if you are working on anything else i would love for you to quit what you're doing seriously downsize your life you don't need as much stuff quit what you're doing and really think about how you [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1773.24s)

could make your life possibly in service to the most important time that has ever been for life i would love to see a movement here happen where people are meeting regularly talking super serious conversations the did everybody see the stockholm resilience center's new report that came out two days ago so you've all seen it's here in [1795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1795.32s)

stockholm the [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] report but the new one there were a lot of areas that didn't have data they have data now and it's not that we are coming up on [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] it's we've surpassed almost all of them radically it may be too late no matter what we do i don't think so i think that biology is amazingly regenerative but only if we start doing like everything right as rapidly as possible and uh so yeah i would love to see i would love to see this not just be a weird form of entertaining conversation that gets forgot about in your lives of the same tomorrow but regular meetings happening to say what could we actually do to shift this [1839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1839.299s)

and i would love to see people getting trained in warm data as part of it because nora's right here in stockholm in one of the and i think i think being able to bring this as a subversive technology because it looks like some cute org dev activity um two halls of power that start opening up possibilities to then be able to direct more pointed things into that [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1864.799s)

space yeah it's always funny to me when daniel describes warm data because actually he does it better than i do um because reality is when the doubting says the dow that is speakable in words is not the eternal doubt nor is so attuned to that thing that she mostly [1891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1891.5s)

uses words as poetry to try to evoke a sense of that which is beyond just pure denotation um so i'm trying to just add also denotative clarity to the thing because it's not your orientation and it shouldn't be thank you i love that i need to just stay with you always i think because there is something um when we were first talking about having this conversation we were thinking about all the ways in which uh change making and um the urgency of this time becomes [1935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1935.419s)

explicit there is a lot of structural change there's a lot there's a lot of big furniture moving to do uh and there are calls calls for community calls for collaboration but you can't have community and you can't have collaboration if you don't have communing [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1962.48s)

there's no there is no plan that can be implemented upon the peoples of the world that are so divided and hate each other right now there's no master plan there's no model that can hold this this aspect of what it is that we can actually do together who we can be together and these the structures and the [1988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=1988.82s)

implications of the structures right down to the little things you know the water is comes out of the faucet in your house your tax number is your tax number your electric bill is your electric bill we don't meet at the water we don't have to help each other create things we have everybody's got [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2012.1s)

their own lawnmower or their own power drill or their own so the individualism of this the separation has been so complete that it's in the logic it's in it's in the air it's just it's just how it is it's how it is um beginning to perceive oneself and each other ah in this moment this is a very serious moment to be alive um it requires that that there be something that disorients us and that disorientation is not necessarily an easy sell right so one of the things that happens with warm data is it's disorienting and the things that come out of it are [2072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2072.22s)

not what people went into it for because it's working in multiple contextual ways and when you're actually working with systemic process it doesn't end you don't have a point where you can say well let's measure this output because that isn't the output so it's it's disorientation [2095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2095.02s)

is the gift now that this took me years to be able to say this because it's not a feel good but it does feel good but it feels good kind of like like when you take it if you have ever given blood and then you have a tourniquet around your arm and they let they take it off and suddenly there's blood flow moving through your limbs in [2118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2118.18s)

another way it's that feeling it really is warm that there's connection happening physically intellectually historically personally interpersonally i remember you once saying if the defense system if the defense department would like to actually protect the nation this is the sort of thing they need to do [2148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2148.54s)

because how do you bring people together without brainwashing them or being falling into some authoritarian pattern without manipulation or authoritarianism how do you make change this will seem like a non-sequitur how many people have heard me talk about [2183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2183.22s)

the [[metacrisis]] somewhere is this familiar okay so i'll i can describe the generative dynamics that give rise to the [[metacrisis]] a bunch of different ways right we can talk about it in terms of linear [[materials economy]] bound to a exponential [[financial system]] with [[embedded growth obligation|embedded growth obligations]] we can go deeper and talk about [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] and social traps um that we can talk about choice making architectures that have externalities built in these are underneath all of the various issues we can go deeper and talk about qualities of mind uh ian mcgilchrist's master and emissary getting reversed type dynamics [2228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2228.82s)

but if you asked me simply to state what is the cause of the [[metacrisis]] i could just say sociopaths run the world and everybody else has ash conformity and that would be fair it would be as good as any of the other descriptions when you're saying the institutions aren't ready to protect the people alexander the great wasn't trying to [2256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2256.06s)

protect the people genghis khan wasn't trying to protect the people the founding fathers of our country who genocided 100 million native americans and enslaved western africa weren't trying to protect the people you know we think about how gruesome world war ii is with 26 million deaths that's a quarter of the number of native americans we killed to [2277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2277.599s)

make the western values that we hold as so civil and so i think and you know when you look at the extreme outliers of different cultures the most peaceful ones and the most violent ones the most uh rational and irrational ones you can i find this very interesting because when [2305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2305.32s)

you look at whole cultures that fall outside of the bell curve of cultures you can see what [[human nature]] can do under certain types of conditioning across a distribution of humans not just what a person can do that might be some genetic aberration so if you look at the janes or the quakers or the buddhists if you look at the janes you can see [2326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2326.2s)

millions of people who won't hurt bugs [[human nature]] can do that if you look at the johnjaweed you can see a population that if you make it to adulthood you've cut people apart with machetes [[human nature]] can do that [[human nature]] is extremely adaptive to conditioning we started doing social science after [2349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2349.18s)

ubiquitous conditioning we had made the [[industrial revolution]] and capitalism in nation-states ubiquitous which is a weird conditioning having nothing to do with our evolutionary history and then we started doing social science then called it nature and then when we see just a second please hear that [2370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2370.26s)

this is a really important piece because it the idea of what is [[human nature]] gets thrown around all the time yeah it's jewish yeah and we point to all sorts of research on what human beings are capable of or even in cognition what's possible and it is actually inside a tautology the research proves the research here and the research method itself was created [2398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2398.68s)

in this ubiquitous condition conditioning yeah so go ahead sorry i had weird fever dreams all night to try to get well i slept a lot and i had these dreams about indigenous cultures teaching white people how to talk to animals it was really beautiful really beautiful um so you can have a culture the way tibet was before it was invaded that is really relatively kind and peaceful but they don't wore well and they get destroyed by the culture that wars well and but that particular kind of thing and the reason i bring this up is [2454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2454.72s)

most of the mongols weren't genghis khan right you can condition people ubiquitously to be a certain way but almost all the wars have been initiated by a small number of people and then everyone else has to participate they both get conditioned by those systems and they're forced to participate in them and but mostly what is driving the economic machine is not the survival of people's kids it's it's winning right at a massive scale at a geopolitical nation-state sent a billionaire um ai masters of the universe scale and so there's a gaussian distribution on psychological attributes [2504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2504.18s)

but there's a power law distribution on power and the people with all the power are outside of the gaussian distribution in their psychological traits they're the people who are oriented to and good at getting power and then in turn make systems that condition everybody else that has to get fixed that has to get fixed it's a up [2528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2528.4s)

topic to take seriously if there is to be a future of civilization that means it has to get addressed that means anyone who gives a about the world who doesn't happen to be a sociopath has to get very active about who's in power and who isn't and what systems are in power [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2548.98s)

and which ones aren't and it's tricky it's very tricky because sometimes these things come cloaked in jeep's clothing they look like the systems that are supporting us they look like your friend you know they look like but we're here for you we you can't live [2571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2571.9s)

without us if you take out the billionaires or whatever it is you're gonna etc etc moloch induces stockholm syndrome and everyone i've never said that in stockholm so what is implicit change how where is that because there's something that's taking place here [2613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2613.96s)

um some way in which uh uh you and i have both stepped into another set of patterns of living our lives of how we spend our days um it's not easy to quit your job and to live differently it's not easy to simply step out of those relationships especially when they your your boss your family your friends you could you could have to do things for very practical reasons you're caught in it um and this this becomes day after day year after year this this is the thing that i'm hearing you say this simply cannot continue there has to be a shift we have to wake up there's to be a [2676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2676.359s)

a coming to to a different place now how do you how do we where is that implicit change because how many times have i done something or you know worked with the warm data lab for example and someone says i don't know what's the point of this what's the point what's in it for me [2700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2700.42s)

and there it is that's the ubiquitous conditioning right there the second you say what's the point or what's in it for me you're in it there isn't a point in the meadow life makes life because life right so wherever this ghost lives it's deep [2726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2726.04s)

and and how how we think about you know what's what's worthwhile what's the point and on the one hand that thinking is absolutely necessary because a lot of what we're doing is sort of not worthwhile a deadly in fact [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2748.599s)

but somehow in the asking of the question you end up back in the same thinking that got us here so there's a a logic shift like i was saying earlier there's some we were going to talk about double binds a little bit and how you get out of a double bind i want to say something to the what's in it for me thing yeah and what you were [2772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2772.78s)

saying underscoring the um what we think of as [[human nature]] studied under ubiquitous conditioning as in [[human nature]] i think what's in it for me is an expression of a hollow human who has to always be focused on getting something because they're so empty from a civilization that has conditioned [2800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2800.02s)

people to be empty because from a supply-side economics point of view it's awesome because when there's emptiness and people are looking for what's in it for them i can sell them a bunch of um i can manipulate them in a bunch of ways based on what will be in it for them and but it's so aberrant to the whole [2821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2821.92s)

history of the human experience if you think about 200 000 years in tribes and you think about words like ubuntu being pretty universal in the tribal culture i am because we are if we all weren't i wouldn't exist and you know it's funny taking a job that we don't like doing something we think is meaningless or actually contributing to problems so [2854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2854.68s)

that for the couple weeks a year we get off we can go camping and live basically a shitty version of an indigenous person's life um like how that fits in the progress narrative is really funny um so i think that i've noticed when people are camping with their friends they don't check [2879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2879.4s)

their phone all the time they don't go to the fridge and stand looking for something all the time because we evolved to have the stimulus of nature and the stimulus of other human beings and intimate relationships and [[music]] and you know like very basic things that actually create a fullness of the emotional human [2897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2897.579s)

and that when we're put in hyponormal environments where we all have our own house where we're alone so we put on the tv to watch faces of other people or we go to facebook to watch faces of other people because we're actually tribal beings but we have not learned how to interact with other humans well so we don't want to live with other humans in fact the only human will share [2916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2916.839s)

space with is the ones you're having sex with and our offspring and nobody else but then we'll spend all our time watching faces that we don't actually have to interact with or have conflict with um i feel like we live in a radically hypo normal environment of the real stimuli that create human fulfillment in which [2937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2937.48s)

case what's in it for me doesn't even arise in a fulfilled human and the hyponormal environment makes us susceptible to [[hypernormal stimuli]] the what's in it for me and the addiction and etc um i think it's and so the story of this is the way humans are this is the way humans are when they're conditioned to [2960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2960.099s)

be that way about how they are it's how they are when they're conditioned exactly and if you're asking what's in it for me it's because you want something because you've been told that you need something because you lack and if you're lacking then you need something so what's in it for you [2982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=2982.359s)

and around you go and this is perfect but it's also interesting to see how hard that little bugger is to get out of the system i mean just paying attention to you know how often you think about something you're getting ready to do or someone you're going to meet or where something's going to go and there is that question what's in it for me [3008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3008.819s)

where's this going and i'm i'm fascinated by these these invisible ghosts that move through us like the what's in it for me or um there are a lot of them there's ideas about the self and that that are very much attached to if you're thinking about what's in it [3035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3035.16s)

for me then who's me where's the edge of me am i just this person or is me my family or is me my grandchildren's grandchildren grandchildren that aren't here yet is me my community is me my nation my culture my my religious group like where's the edge of me is me my bacteria and the ecology that they're in what's [3059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3059.819s)

in it for which me and that's an interesting and confusing question which me are we talking about i wish that was actually a question people were asking yeah i don't think most people are actually inquiring into the nature of self beyond the boundary i don't think so either but it it's worth asking yes [3083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3083.7s)

what's in it for which me well the finiteness of time is a reality no matter what to it would be the case in a totally different civilization that i wouldn't have time to learn every single language and every musical instrument and meet every person and see every beautiful place and so asking is this the best use of my life energy aligned with what is most sacred to me [3109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3109.98s)

and what i'm devoted to is a good question but that's a very different question than what's in it for me because it goes back to nthorter agency this is bringing us right back around to that if you're asking what am i participating in in this membership with life itself [3134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3134.7s)

then you're looking at not only the you that is in this skin body but multiple relationships and relationships and relationships and relationships there's rigor there it takes effort to do that um not really that much i would have to say but it takes effort [3161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3161.579s)

it takes a moment of of stopping and getting out of the script out of the teleprompter and noticing that there are these many many me's not many me's um and that practice um i think is actually absolutely vital in this moment for how we go get get anywhere out of this mess i'll share one very tangible thing related to what you just said is our consciousness is being conditioned by our environment all the time our social environment and um in our media environment the [3221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3221.94s)

information that is coming in when we started the concilians project i did a project where we curated different facebook feeds like made different avatars created facebook feeds and i had some facebook feeds that it's obviously different in the us and sweden here but there were just a huge amount of uh videos of [3246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3246.119s)

cops abusing black people and but what it doesn't show is what percentage of all police interactions that is because by the time i've seen a hundred even if it was over the course of years but there are tens of thousands of interactions every day it might be a very statistically small percentage and there might be a lot where the cops are abusing white people and latino people [3267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3267.3s)

and but when all i'm seeing is that it seems to be the totality of reality because we evolved in an environment where what our eyes saw showed us reality and then i and in watching that even though i curated it by the time i had watched it for an hour i hated cops and thought they were all [3291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3291.359s)

racist and like and then i curated another one that showed cop saving kittens from trees and doing heroic stuff and black people attacking cops and then i was like back the blue and i could be affected by the media environment even when i was curating it and so um you know after we're done with this conversation you'll go home and you'll scroll and it will remove everything we talked about and then you'll get notifications and you'll have messages and then you know at some point you may or may not remember this conversation it will be [3332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3332.52s)

mostly as if it never happened one way to change that is go change the settings of everything coming in your media environment tonight like just go unfollow a whole bunch of and then go intentionally follow a bunch of other follow the stockholm resilience center so you see [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] follow nate stuff so you see that information [3360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3360.839s)

coming out like follow a bunch of things it will actually keep you apprised of what is really going on that's meaningful unfollow the other stuff so that you at least have because all of marketing and all of politics will try to capture your attention and consciousness in other directions at least do what you can to have some continuous reminders of what is more [3385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3385.38s)

important yeah that's what we called this talk what is important what is important um sometimes i do an [[exercise]] with my classes where i ask people to do to describe a system any system any system your body your relationship to your partner you know whatever global crisis catches your eye and to illustrate it okay now most of the time when we illustrate a system you start by having nodes okay so there's an economy node or there's a family node or there's a you know here's me and there's my husband and here's my [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3444.54s)

kids and here's you have these nodes and then we connect them with lines right um or you know you could do another one you could do one on nav right let's let's draw the system that is nav but don't use any lines see if you can call up another form of description because you don't have any relationships in your life that look like lines or feel like lines so this is really important because actually if you think that you are responding to or studying a system that is connected by nodes and lines you're missing a lot of information a lot of very important information [3502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3502.44s)

what's in those relationships how do they what texture are they what color are they what rhythm are they in how do the relationships relate to the other relationships so that you don't end up with some kind of idea that you can just swish in more and more and more data to get an understanding of the system you have to actually understand what's [3529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3529.26s)

in the relationship between the different aspects of it and what's the feeling of those relationships right you could describe a family and you could have you know parents kids grandparents and just draw some lines but as you know every family has a completely different logic and feel and communication that's possible in that family [3554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3554.52s)

so that [[exercise]] for me gets at what you're talking about that that it's there's a there's a whole realm of information that's there that you know you're in it you just haven't been asked to express it it's not the normal way we express it and if you just look at systemic process as nodes that are [3581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3581.4s)

connected by lines you have a different agency altogether than if you start to actually illustrate those relational processes your sense of agency is vastly changed by that what do you how do you how do you come into that right if you have nodes and sticks you can move this and remove that [3605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3605.099s)

and you have this first order agency is easy to come by foreign models is idol worship right the model of reality is not reality it's a false idol to the real reality and believing that its reality is idle worship and so models can be useful they're always wrong they're always potentially harmful i think of models as intellectual tools and they're very powerful models that are very powerful intellectual tools if i'm teaching a kid how to use a skill saw i teach them to be very careful with it because yes they can cut wood but they can cut their hand off really easy and if i'm teaching them how to use a gun i teach them to be very careful with it and when i think about math and i think about physics and i think about systems theory i think of skill saws and guns but radically more powerful than skill saws and guns because they can make nukes in ais and synthetic bio i think [3682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3682.68s)

about how to perceive reality compellingly enough that you can make a weird simulation of reality that is powerful enough to actually destroy [[base reality]] or meaningful parts of it so i think about all techni meaning human abstractions about the world as powerful and dangerous and that they have to be held that way they should be taught that way this love of models is another one of these lurking ghosts where you think you can just reach for something and it's going to help it's gonna it's gonna give us [3745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3745.859s)

assistance in this and if you don't remember that it's just a map and the thing is you don't most of the time people forget that their map is a map and they think yeah but this is how it is i've we've done the illustration we've done this thing um we started tonight with a piece of [3771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3771.42s)

[[music]] and in a way a piece of [[music]] is also a map but it's a very different kind of map because you're invited into it with many more forms of your your process of making sense of memory of of emotion of the was it was it isidorah duncan who said i can't remember who it was at r [3807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3807.119s)

nice it might have been that you listen to [[music]] with every part of your being so most of the time the the map that you draw does not call upon every part of your being and it doesn't allow for you to completely interpret it differently next time this is important because if what we're talking about is [3830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3830.7s)

life then the information and our our way of moving with information must also be alive um what does that mean to have information that's alive and what does it what does it bring from you what does it call from you when you hear [3856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3856.68s)

a piece of [[music]] what does it what's coming up through you and and i think that again coming back to agency that is at nth order it's it looks different it feels different it's another thing it doesn't feel like a shopping list or a to-do list or a steering committee it feels very [3879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3879.42s)

different because it is coming from another direction so you know i use this example a lot but we have the sustainable development goals right and the sustainable development goals if you just look at them there's a whole meta message there what does the culture that we're in look for what's the appetite for [3903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3903.78s)

information what's what is it well we like boxes we like we like boxes we like to separate things we feel like we have this under control when we can do this there's a way in there's a kind of agency that those boxes have oh trillions of dollars have been put into committees for each one of those boxes and people are beginning to you know [3928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3928.859s)

even get involved in how they are you know pick three okay um but if you look at this image that we have right here right there where there's a mother nursing her baby i would invite you to see every single sustainable development goal is right there that requires and as mammals to continue we must be able to feed the babies and the babies have to be able to feed the babies and the baby's babies have to be able to feed the babies and the people who make the food have to be able to feed their babies and the people who make the clothes have to feed their babies and we need air we need water and we need soil we need equality we need [3974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=3974.099s)

respect for each other and we need the whole pictures right there so this is what i mean by the logic is so different at first it doesn't look like something you can interact with sorry um but there it is yeah i was thinking that um [4006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4006.5s)

it seems like there's this overwhelming complexity there's 50 million chemicals in the database of the american chemical society and to try to think about what all the endocrine disrupting and neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects of all of them plus the combinatorial effects of them and etc are [4033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4033.92s)

except you don't actually have to do that like the the simplicity of don't don't make systems that have to grow forever that's dumb don't make systems that extract resources faster than they can replenish themselves or that create pollution that's done [4053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4053.48s)

like the the actual logics of thriving systems are pretty simple um so there's a second simplicity on um there's a complexity that people have to have if they want to try to understand how to interface with these systems which we do have to do temporarily to change them [4083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4083.18s)

i want people to learn how to lobby for government subsidies as well as the big pharma and big ag and big chemical companies do but for the exact opposite side and i want people to learn how to convert toxic subsidies in chemical agriculture to [[regenerative agriculture]] because then the market topology will start to move the world in a better [4112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4112.219s)

direction that does require some real um understanding of financial and political systems but long term that's actually not the kind of intelligence that humans need to have long term um it it is interesting how much more simple it is to be able to think in [4139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4139.46s)

second simplicity and first principles um i've been fascinated lately i just finished this new book and i'm really excited about that and as i finished it it was i felt a little bit free from all the thinking that i had been working on for years um and it opened up the door for for new things to start roaring in and there's [4168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4168.5s)

this tiny little piece um that's about this fantastic possibility that every time the seasons change every single organism changes and the relationship that makes life does not nothing gets broken [4195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4195.92s)

when we're talking about the [[metacrisis]] one of the more difficult conundrums in this is how to fix one thing without breaking six others the externalities the the the the puzzle requires action but every action seems to make it worse seems to break something else um so what what are the ways in which we as living creatures [4226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4226.4s)

can also begin to make change toward life that doesn't break life i want to say something about what you said there the anthropocene is complex not complicated it seems like it's complicated in individual building is complicated a laptop is complicated anything of the [4259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4259.28s)

blueprint is complicated but the anthropocene is complex it is being created by human activity mediated by sociologies and economies and cultures and things like that and it's evolving right the technosphere is actually evolving you don't and it's also symbiotic in the same way that a single animal [4282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4282.62s)

can't live by themselves do you have predators and prey and the plants that they have these kind of self-sustaining guilds each technology requires lots of other technologies to exist and then it gives rise to new technologies it creates environmental niches that give rise to new things the problem is that the the human built world the way we have [4302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4302.12s)

built it the technosphere social sphere complex is complex in a way that is incompatible with the biosphere and so it is an accelerating [[complex system]] that is debasing the biological substrate that it depends upon which is why it's suicidal and if you think about i i don't know if everybody has read [[meditation|meditations]] on moloch or heard me talk about it but if you think about a hundred trillion dollar a day economy where all of that money is a decentralized incentive system incentivizing all of the humans to figure out new ways to make money and or [4351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4351.62s)

do more of the existing ways which means that it's incentivizing search algorithms and optimization algorithms it's running on 8 billion people but it's also running all eight billion people so as powerful as parallel computational processing is and why the cloud became [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4373.1s)

so much better than supercomputers being able to run a lot of parallel process this is parallel process against things that are already general intelligent on top of general intelligences and then all the computational intelligence and narrow ais are being built into this system and this system has an imperative right it has a built-in growth imperative that [4394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4394.04s)

involves all countries and all technologies and anyone who does the bidding of that system well gets more power within it and anyone who goes against that system is also going against those who are doing well in it and they'll get down regulated and that thing totally has is what's causing [[climate change]] nobody wants [[climate change]] but that thing is causing it that thing is driving ai [[arms race|arms races]] and is causing [[species extinction]] and boiling the oceans that thing is on a suicidal path that thing does have to get killed and killed or converted if we want a habitable biosphere and responsible use of tech to be a [4446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4446.12s)

possibility the trick is it is actually functioning like an ecology yep and and that means super resilient it's super resilient it can it's it's responsive and that our bodies are actually dependent upon it right now so we have an ecology of crises [4471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4471.92s)

and that's a really big problem because it's not like a machine if you pick up you just you know lift up the hood of your truck you can put pull out parts and replace them this is not that it's compensatory it's it's interdependent it's patterning and re-patterning and and it's moving it's it's and super [4498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4498.679s)

intelligent yeah so i think for me one of the things that i i think is important but what's important is not to underestimate what it takes to to actually be in this moment and to participate in the process of shifting or or killing it um don't lose morale because we need you to keep playing [[music]] keep falling in love keep loving your babies keep taking care of each other but but at the same time don't be thinking that this is simply a matter of making a new model [4552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4552.14s)

and that the the trickery of what it is that we're working with here is significant it's significant and in some ways we don't understand it any more than we really understand what makes a forest make life if there are ways in which these things are coming together [4576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4576.5s)

that are beyond our perception so be careful right be careful but be rigorous and stay in love because if you fall out of love with it you can with life that's not a good place to be the reason that the meadow keeps being a meadow is because life the reason for doing this is not because anything just life and that's enough that's everything yeah let's bring nate on thank you son thank you good to see everyone um just real quickly how many have [4635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4635.54s)

followed my work or my podcast just to get a sense oh my gosh um so in her uh typical nora way i said how long would you like me to speak and she says between 1 and 20 minutes uh it'll be closer to one and then we can take a break and uh and reconvene and do some questions daniel don't take this the wrong way but you should get [4660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4660.44s)

sick more often um i'm not sick uh i feel pretty good however daniel has recently recommended some multivitamins to me and there's a daytime one and a nighttime one and this afternoon i took the nighttime one so uh you know of what i refer i i feel fine but a little a little sleepy um so uh i took a few notes um i think that we do know the future in some ways we don't know what it's going to look like but there are some biophysical constraints recently in my work i talk about the the four horsemen of the 2020s which are number one are our financial claims [4710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4710.42s)

relative to our underlying biophysical reality and instead of tightening our belt and using less we're doubling down and creating debt at a very fast uh rate and that inevitably has to reconnect with the biophysical underpinnings of our our situation which are energy materials uh and ecology the second category is [4738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4738.44s)

um we are rapidly changing our relationship with what is the wealth and productivity that has got us to this point and the historical story has been about money and technology and the reality is energy materials and ecology and with the russia ukraine situation our geopolitical arrangement and daniel [4760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4760.699s)

talked about all the wars in the past being started by false flags and the very sociopathic powerful people um so there is a phase shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world the third risk is the six continent [[supply chain]] and the complexity of our grocery stores and our systems and our medical supplies because it's been based on this part of the carbon pulse where [4788](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4788.3s)

we've outsourced everything into this really complex situation and then the last piece is the social contract how we get along with our our fellow citizens within and between countries and so we don't know what's going to happen specifically but i think now there are no longer any non-radical paths ahead of us in the next decade and so we might not know what's going to [4816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4816.92s)

happen in the scale of what's going to happen but i think getting to nora's point about nth order agency there are some no regret strategies um that exist and the one staring us in the face is what's here this evening is we have to start building social capital and social relationships even if we're not solving problems even if we're not doing things [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4844.82s)

directly to prepare because we can't really prepare other than to maybe imagine what life would be like with 30 percent less income or 30 percent less energy and then act accordingly but what we can do is build relationships ahead of time i've been referring to this as rocks in the river is if there are no psychologically physically emotionally uh structurally [4870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4870.88s)

full stack humans in a community when these events come and the water races faster everything's going to tumble down and if there are these bigger rocks that act as anchors they help others in the community and if there's enough rocks they actually redirect the water as it comes through we're working on really complicated scary issues daniel's mentioned ai and [4901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4901.36s)

biology there's russia not too far from here and my country is doing just sociopathic things not the whole country but certain people in the country and it can become overwhelming um i've found that the single biggest antidote for me is three things but one in particular one is time with my ducks and my dogs [4928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4928.58s)

i'm just being in the moment with animals and my friends two is spending time in nature and three and i i this hit home two nights ago daniel and six or seven of the uh our close friends working on this went out for thai food in stockholm by the way so far i love stockholm the weather is freaking awesome um but we had dinner and we were talking [4953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4953.36s)

about these issues and i just felt this levity of spirit despite the topics that we were talking about i was with seven other humans who deeply care about this moment in time and that we were helping each other we had each other's backs we were all working on the most meaningful thing that we could be working on and that's worth more than money or anything it's working with other humans on a [4977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=4977.06s)

collective path um so uh i have more to say but i think i'll just um stop there and we'll take a break and then have some questions with the three of us but thank you all for being here and i have that feeling again tonight applause so um we're gonna have a little break [5005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5005.32s)

uh and what foreign we are going to have a little break you actually don't have a break um this is the moment when you get a chance to kind of talk to each other and i have a little bit of conversation around this conversation and then we'll come back together and take some questions so take [5030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5030.52s)

10 minutes 20 minutes take 20 minutes and um and then we'll come back together and if anybody comes up i'll be bowing normally i'm a hugger but i don't want to get anybody sick so applause to weld this together between the american and [5078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5078.94s)

swedish way well i played the swedish blues before and now i play a american blues this is a sleepy john estes song [[music]] oh my god [[music]] [[music]] foreign [[music]] [[music]] [[music]] spongebob [[music]] [[music]] applause applause oh thank you so much that's colorful [5231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5231.46s)

the blues that was so nice so we are here ready with a microphone to assist and there are also people online that have questions did you want to start with the people online so the hub in her dick saval has two questions so i just read them [5258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5258.699s)

for you because it's uh we have a bit a problem here with a technique the first question is how do we get away from the current [[financial system]] and the second question is how can we build organizations to work towards something better against the destructive powers of better or against the destructive powers that you allude to in your conversations [5295](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5295.96s)

maybe we get some more questions before you answer or yeah let's get a collection from the room and then bring them all together instead of doing it one at a time i wonder what are the most hopeful initiatives that you have seen so far it's been about a year since you did since you did the previous event here and i remember being there as well what [5323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5323.98s)

would you change say has changed in your world view since then for the better and for the worse so uh nora you were on your way to start to talk about double bind i just like to bring that thread up again and also we need to kill it if it is outside of us or is it it's easy to think that it is outside us um there was this question that popped up um around when when is implicit change or aware i think is implicit change and i'm curious about when when is change thanks um my name is anna belen and thank you for your great um inspiring talk this evening you talk a bit about complexity and about discomfort and how you need to enter that discomfort and um it strikes me as well like in this room we have a lot of people that are very comfortable and engaged by these ideas [5413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5413.8s)

how do you engage with those that are less interested how do you engage with the discomfort and that challenge to an audience that is less willing to hear thanks um yeah there were several of those that i have thoughts on i'll start with the last one [5440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5440.199s)

um there are many audiences that near need to hear some versions of this but there is not one version of this for all audiences and i've learned that i have a small organization and i had choices on what is the audience hollywood needs to hear this story or whatever the swedish version of hollywood is where right now we've got [5467](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5467.139s)

we're gonna colonize outer space and send people there with matt damon to plant potatoes on mars or we have brain eating zombies and the reality is going to be in the middle and when you give humans examples of altruism they are 400 percent more likely to do altruistic acts and we need media showing realistic versions of [5492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5492.88s)

maybe a simpler more local less materialistic future to give people ideas for what to do we also need politicians and leaders to have some sort of blueprints or plans for what's coming so that they can break glass in case of emergency and people have thought about it cognitively ahead of the emotional moment when things are necessary we need young people to have [5516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5516.88s)

different understandings of the future and their role in it and their own development like thomas bjorkman talks about the nordic secret and the psychological development of young people we need community leaders to have a little step ahead of the curve and and lead action and then there's the general public i haven't had the bandwidth to do all [5542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5542.44s)

that nor does daniel or or any of us so i've been speaking to the choir um and i think that's the choir is starting to grow i call them the walking worried people that don't really know the details but they know something is wrong and something is coming and you know we spoke three nights ago to kth university and there were a lot of international students there from [5566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5566.02s)

bangladesh and egypt and morocco and they were like well you're coming here as a person of privilege and people in my country don't have choices and you have choices and so when we talk about collapse uh or i call great simplification because it's less binary people say when is collapse coming well for many collapse is already here so [5588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5588.699s)

when you say when is collapse coming what you really mean is when is it coming for us so you're right to ask the question um i do think daniel and his organization civilization research institute is looking at a lot of really important critical risks to our civilization like ai and bio weapons and things like that personally [5614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5614.139s)

i don't think that's something that we need to talk about with everyone which is work do the work but there are messages that because what can i do about ai or or [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] but i can help inspire and educate people to to meet the future halfway my view is we are not going to kill the [[superorganism]] the [[superorganism]] is going to run out of high octane fuel and there will be a [5641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5641.739s)

financial whoosh and what we can do now is change the initial conditions of those future moments high education by building community by simplifying our own lives by raging against the machine and protecting ecosystems and and species and you know whatever's meaningful to you whatever path is important i think those are the things that we can do now [5666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5666.76s)

i worry about killing it because you're right we are also it so if it is killed there is a a potential of instead of a bend of a break and i don't know how that looks but i think to directly kill it even if that were possible may not be the most benign outcome my colleagues may disagree i'll i'll pause there should we kill it you mean to comment on that yeah [5702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5702.3s)

what is his point it is in us of us all around us running through us um and and uh but i also um feel there is this vampire and it is a life sucking vampire it's what it does it eats life [5740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5740.86s)

um so there is a a another part of me that realizes that it is the undead i mean in in the metaphor of the vampire it's an undead thing and that means that it eats life future life in and keeps current life uh comfortable and convenient it eats all sorts of life i think no it it the 13 species that it extincts [5776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5776.739s)

every day is current life that are all being and the fact that you know well there's one percent of the mammal biomass in the wild there are in [[factory farm|factory farms]] today that's eating life in the most gruesome way possible um it is also uh eating the possibility for future [5802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5802.659s)

life um the we have this dynamic as we've done so many podcasts he can tell my facial expressions what i want to say something the moloch thing that you're asking like to what degree is it in us there's something weird about sapiens relative to the other species that we [5836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5836.02s)

inhabit the world with maybe some of the earlier hominids had some amount of this quality but they're not here anymore um that does not necessitate moloch in the [[metacrisis]] but it certainly makes it possible which is as huge as whale brains are and as sentient as they are and in my guess probably have deeper sentience than us in many ways they don't figure out how to protect themselves from whaling ships there is a certain kind of abstraction that leads to techne that leads to an anthropocene they don't have [5888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5888.159s)

and um it does seem like the best anthropological story we have currently is that homo habilis and australopithecus and all the earlier hominids that we co-inhabited the planet with were extincted by us because even though they were [[tool making]] we were doubling down on the [[tool making]] and tool advancing capacity cerebrally and it does seem like many of the megafauna that were extincted were extincted by our early over hunting i think when ian mcgilchrist talks about the master in the emissary where he's saying that the right hemispheric modes of being that are more oriented to what david bone would have talked about as a pers perceiving [5938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5938.139s)

wholeness in a very wide non-semiotically mediated way and the left brain perceiving semiotically mediated parts being able to see one being able to model right and being able to see some parts having causal relationships to other parts i.e techne both cognitive techni and the applied [[physical tech]] name but currency and democracy and language are technique [5963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5963.58s)

what ian was saying is that the left brain has to be an emissary in service to the right brain because it's very good at goal achieving but it's not good at picking the right goals and if it doesn't have something binding what the right goals are that is perceiving life widely in the process of being very good at goal achieving with narrow goals it'll harm a lot of things [5990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=5990.28s)

and then in the process of harming things other people will have to do comparable stuff to deal with those people and then you get an [[arms race]] you get an [[exponential curve]] and you get moloch i think our capacity for recursive abstraction led to a degree of science that gives us the large hadron collider and the [6013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6013.5s)

ability to split the nucleus of an atom right but it also gives us the ability for the prayer of the bodhisattva that says i want to bind myself to all sentient beings throughout all time space and history so if that that property that capacity for um perceiving wholeness and having our goals bound to that that has to bind the goal achieving that would be wisdom minding power if we get that at the level of uh not just some people because then of course you you always have a situation where someone can do the sociopathic thing and when and then everyone has to race to do the sociopathic thing or get [6062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6062.699s)

taken over so it's not just within some people the master has to bind the emissary it's an also holistically everyone has to ensure that no one is pursuing advanced goal achieving in service of life harming goals and because we have this capacity to see the world and model it and do science and then because of [6087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6087.9s)

science do applied tech and because of that we can build powerful enough systems to destroy this thing because we have that ability the other ability the bodhisattva ability has to be developed enough and bind that thing or we do self-terminate so that's in all of us i would not say there's an even distribution of it in everybody [6113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6113.34s)

hey we started doing a research project recently on what the equivalent of sociopathy and dark triad traits and indigenous cultures were and we haven't finished but this is something i'm very interested in and for the most part what we've seen so far is there was radically less of that trait because there wasn't an evolutionary [6134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6134.76s)

niche for it because in a small dunbar tribe if you lied everybody knew you lied and if you somebody you were  the people that your life depends upon and so in that small environment there was just not a niche for it the niche came later i did talk to a lakota uh scholar who said in the lakota tribe [6155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6155.04s)

if a kid had the traits that they referred to as the equivalent of sociopathy the whole tribe worked to heal it in them and if they didn't heal it in them at the rite of passage ceremony of puberty where they become an adult they were killed because they said that if that didn't happen those people when they grow up always caused war [6176](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6176.04s)

i think so i i think there is not an even distribution of um traits there's definitely some roots of the [[metacrisis]] that live in everybody i want to go to this question of where do you see hope and tie it into what you're saying [6209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6209.719s)

so probably the my um my favorite work that i've seen besides the two of you of course um is uh with the clinic uh in italy that uh works on paralysis now i first became interested in this clinic paralysis and terminal pain so um i became interested in this with the early um researchers of the bateson institute one of which was rex who went with me to this clinic and our question that we went with was how do systems get unstuck we were interested in stuckness and paralysis is stuckness [6263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6263.46s)

um it's not a good question because it depends on where you draw the edge of the stuckness right where if you if you're not careful and you say the system is stuck what you're not seeing is the wild compensatory processes that take place around the edges to maintain a stuckness if you have a stuckness here you're only looking in one part [6288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6288.3s)

of the system so it's not a good question but nevertheless it was a good starting place and we went to this clinic and what i saw there was without question the most beautiful systemic work i've ever seen to this day and what they did required no beeping things it required um no injections it required a a fascinating process in which for example the practitioner would would offer a small wooden block with a spiral in it and ask the patient to describe what it would feel like to run their finger around that spiral not to do it but to describe it verbally okay so i'm [6342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6342.9s)

inviting you into this because i want you to notice all the cognitive processes that are necessary to do just that okay that's visual that's memory that's verbal that's tactile that's relational that's cultural there's a whole lot just right there what they didn't do was go up to that frozen [6367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6367.44s)

arm of the person in paralysis and try to open it massage it acupuncture it treat it stretch it open it they didn't do that then they would give the the block again and this time run the the finger of the the good hand if there was one around very slowly and at the end of that movement around the spiral ask the question not what did you feel [6391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6391.199s)

but what's the difference okay and in that question what is being required for a response is actually three versions okay it's it's what they felt the first time what they felt the second time and what the difference was so that's complicated and then it's also visual tactile temperature comes in with this one um measurement movement of arm and like you know when you move your finger around a spiral there's measurement happening how far is it around speed ballots again speech etc so what's happening in this process and this is where the inspiration for [6436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6436.8s)

the warm data lab came from is that these different aspects of cognitive um learning are actually informing each other and they're doing so inside the individual in a way that is absolutely free to move in the way that it moves according to that person [6460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6460.08s)

that's cool so and and i would you know obviously i wouldn't be that impressed with it if i didn't see that it was also working um so what i am leery of is this idea that it's ever remotely beneficial to tell people what they should think what they should do or how [6488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6488.159s)

they should feel and what i love about that process is the way in which there is a wilderness of connective processes that are shaping and informing each other right so i asked them because i noticed they weren't going for the what i would call the pathology the paralysis they didn't go for the thing it wasn't a [6510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6510.659s)

first order corrective this is an example of an of an nth order response i want you to be we've been talking about nthort or agency tonight and how it doesn't look like what you think it's going to look like this is an example so of course what happens is that not not only do these people change in terms of their possibility of how their body [6535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6535.199s)

moves and understands their world but their whole personality opens into new curiosity new artistic creation not all sorts of things happen capacities for emotion capacities for all sorts of things that maybe they didn't have before they were paralyzed actually so what's pathology what's pathology and when i asked them this i asked it because i realized that the thing i saw wasn't what they were seeing and what their response was was that pathology is the organisms inability to make sense of its world that's a really interesting definition of pathology so what is happening in that [[exercise]] is that there is a multi [6588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6588.42s)

multi-sensorial multi-cognitive process that is given an opportunity to reconnect re to to make new formations of [[sensemaking]] of how what it is to be in the world they're not healing them they're not putting them back how they were they're not reconstituted that they're not at all so we changed our question to how do [6611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6611.1s)

systems learn not how do they get unstuck um and there's a whole lot of work on that but you asked what for me was the most hopeful and it was that because of this incredible insight there for the potential for things to make connection that are not necessarily doing it explicitly all right we talked about implicit change and when is it [6639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6639.84s)

and it it's a win it's an interesting question because when is it and suddenly it happens and you don't know how far you are on the x line before you have one more minute and suddenly there's a shift there's a learning um and for me this also ties into the question around orcs and how can [6663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6663.48s)

organizations do better which is i'm just paraphrasing what you said um which for us for what i'm interested in with that is working with organizations and when we do warm data work with organizations we don't allow for there to be a closed system there is an illusion that an organization ends at the edge of the organization this is part of the problem so when we do warm data labs with organizations we ask them to be sure that everyone who comes invites people from their life their family their friends people from the community so that the membrane is [6709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6709.26s)

moved so that there is a different kind of accountability in the room so that people can actually be in another way besides just a tacitly protecting their employment which is one of the dangers of doing you know development workshops with organizations is that they don't really want to develop past that point where [6733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6733.5s)

they could lose their job it's a problem yeah okay so that that was just a few let me build on that and then circle back to the question about hope so what i've learned from you among other things is you can't just look at the thing you have to look at the thing in the context of other things um and this has origins in biology [6760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6760.139s)

multi-level selection it's not just that we're competitive creatures but we're also cooperative creatures and those things were both locked in our our history but applying it to to my work and your work daniel and i met a few years ago and i'm working on energy ecology human behavior and daniel's working on uh you know [[existential risk|existential risks]] ai and things like that and we became friends and we started to interact our contexts and a couple things happened three things happened at least three things happened one is we actually constrained each other's stories because he didn't really know about my stuff and i didn't know about his stuff [6806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6806.46s)

so we were both like oh man things are worse than we thought because i didn't know about your stuff um the second thing that happened is we became friends and we supported each other and then we introduced each other to other people and the network expanded and there was an emergence there and the third thing that happened is we're influencing a conversation and there's [6826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6826.679s)

an emergence that is unknown um and we're shifting the conversation in a small way but but that's what's happening now that gives me hope is there are hundreds of thousands of humans that are starting to pay attention to this conversation and i am in my role as a podcaster or whatever i'm increasingly more comfortable not [6851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6851.34s)

knowing what to do because i always used to feel if i say these are the problems uh i felt guilty leaving the room without having the solutions so a year ago i started to use the word responses instead of solutions and now i'm i'm even more comfortable just trying to set the table and it was really unexpected to me that oh yeah last year i started a [6877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6877.56s)

podcast because i know a lot of people like daniel and nora and i wanted to listen to what they had to say but it's changed me i'm trying to share knowledge with other humans i am learning and changing in the process um and i just want to like broaden this conversation to more humans to have this emergent thing with the meadow in the context and i feel that it's actually [6903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6903.9s)

happening and that's what gives me hope is the better side of humanity pontus you you said should we kill it we are at a unique time okay going back to your thing i'll add a a depressing fact but there's a reason 10 000 years ago for every human that was on the planet there were fifteen thousand pounds of mammals wild mammals by the year 1800 for every human on the [6933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6933.06s)

planet there were 200 pounds of mammals during that ten thousand years it was largely that human population went up drip drove that but since 1800 we've gone from 200 pounds to five pounds of mammals per human alive and that is an increase in human population but it also is a decimation of nature so what we're doing this ecocidal [6961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6961.679s)

tendency that we're having this has been in play for 10 000 years what's different now is the scale of it and this room full of people and others who are actually aware of it aware of where we came from how we got here what we're doing what we actually need and having these conversations so we are aware of it now is our awareness [6986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=6986.34s)

in a heisenberg sort of observing science to change it in are we aware of the [[superorganism]] and or malik or whatever you say is that enough to change it in an emerging way to steer it to shrink it to transform it is a question i think about a lot but run away i mean there's a we there's a a runaway and i remember the first time i i went to a sort of a disclosure of an ipcc report and i looked at all the details and i said yeah but where what about the runaway where's that part of this and they said oh no we don't do that wait a minute [7053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7053.179s)

so we have all this bad news and you haven't done the runaway this is really incredible because that's the part where the math goes into chaos math it's not even calculable at that point it's it's you do it for understanding but not for calculations um and what i want to bring in is that that there's an importance to this coming together of of learning and studying and and playing [[music]] and eating and having babies and this we need to do this understanding that what we are actually responding to at this point is run away which is really a different kind of response and i what i keep perceiving is that [7114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7114.5s)

there's this grabbing need to pull one issue at a time and they're the it's in motion now they are we're in runaway we're in it so how do you how do you respond to runaway collectively is actually also with runaway but run away of another kind like like run away like like people meeting people meeting people meeting people like the the the way in which if we have a conversation here and you guys all go home and you have a conversation with somebody that that conversation will be a little bit different and then that person talks to someone and it's a little bit different but [7164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7164.84s)

something has this is the implicit part that something has shifted and maybe it's like really not the thing you thought maybe it's recognizing yeah those guys got up there and they were totally off script and they were actually in conversation and we don't see that very often maybe it's that i don't know that that daniel came even though he was sick but seriously that's an act of love that's a gift so just recognizing how potent these nth order responses are in runaway because that's what we're what we're dealing with so i just wanted to bring that word in the room because i feel like it should be here [7215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7215.84s)

had something i was feeling to share about the question of hope optimism um there's a tremendous amount of like i guess you can call it hope it's more like warmth and joy that i feel every time i go to an animal shelter and watch the people who take care of [7248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7248.599s)

animals uh every time i watch a teacher or a nurse who really puts in discretionary efforts to care for the kids and the people they're caring for um when i see people who run orphanages like all the people who have just extremely high care i i mean it's like that's the species i love that's the human species i love what do i feel optimistic about in terms of something converging to the appropriate scale and speed of the [[metacrisis]] i can say what i sense that it can be but i don't see it happening yet um i mean i love a lot of the work in [7304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7304.28s)

[[regenerative agriculture]] and [[permaculture]] and things like that but overall the total number of global [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] is increasing each year and the probability of all of them is increasing so we're not on track like we're not can we're not converging um one thing i wanted to say though is um my partner summer you can ask her if you [7326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7326.599s)

want to um dispositionally just as a person i am pegged almost as far to the optimist side as somebody can be which you might actually think is funny given the nature of my work but like in almost all personal situations i'm like oh we'll figure it out oh there's a solution we'll figure it out i'll be no problem and so that's my disposition i actually trust people who do [[catastrophic risk]] work who have an optimistic disposition more because otherwise they might just be catastrophizing um i know a lot of people who are actually exceptional in catastrophic wristwork because they just catastrophize all the time but [7369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7369.32s)

um but i really don't think i have a catastrophizing disposition i run the dialectics on all these things and it's just like damn the the trajectories are pretty clear um i think if you haven't studied it most people here don't have a clear sense of how [7389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7389.239s)

much one person who really learns strategy and implements it intensively can affect the world like i don't think many people here understand how much henry kissinger actually architected the the world but study it a little bit you'll be  mind blown i don't think most people have a sense of how much one [7416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7416.86s)

uh george soros or bill gates affects the world relative to an average person but it's so many orders of magnitude it's not like a hundred times more or a thousand times more and but when i see the people who run animal shelters when i see the jane goodalls they don't learn how to do what kissinger knows how to do or what soros [7443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7443.0s)

means how to do they don't learn how to um capture the [[financial system|financial systems]] or the political systems or the uh media and mindset of the people if you want to know the thing that i feel hopeful about it's people with jane goodall's heart learning how to do kiss and jerry and stuff learning how to actually capture and change the systems of power without [7472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7472.94s)

being affected by them and there's a particular kind of like priesthood or whatever you want to call it that someone has to take to enter that not for self-will i don't know if people have ever you know like the the very top people at blackrock the very top people at the largest financial institutions are in [7495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7495.44s)

the cia work way the harder than almost everybody else does like they are working all the goddamn time they have a degree of drive and ambition that is almost mind-blowing and they learn the most powerful tools of technological advantage and so if the world is to do better it does need people who learn the tools of technological advantage in power and are [7519](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7519.8s)

willing to work extremely hard but not for self-serving goals and not even for nation-state goals but for the well-being of the commons long term and then that won't be the future world but that is totally the one that has to happen in transition using the devil's tools for gaia's work do we want to take another couple [7547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7547.28s)

questions okay okay hi thank you i have a question about words because there seems to be a interesting difference between you daniel and yunor and how you approach words and you spoke a little bit about it [7573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7573.26s)

in the beginning because you the two of you think similarly but you speak in different ways so i was wondering if you could speak a little bit about how you attend to to words especially when you adopt new words what are good words what are good words in different contexts what do good words do you make up lots of words do you want to [7608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7608.5s)

speak to them okay mask you can connect these two actually in a certain way the word that stuck with me you mentioned it several times is transformation and it made me think what it actually takes to transform anything and um tantric practices came to my mind i don't mean sexual practices i just mean really transforming the energies [7633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7633.26s)

and what it takes from a person individual person to sit with the heaviest of energies the anger the rage the extremes of desire and it seems that the way through my experience and just by also the learning the practices is the way to the other side is the way through there is no way to circumnavigate the darkness at all and [7654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7654.44s)

this is something that takes a lot from an individual person to train takes a lifetime to get good at it if we just scale it up to a collective level how can we possibly transform without total immersion in darkness first to get to the other side so there is no semantics that can get us [7675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7675.02s)

out of the experience it seems i just like to hear the thoughts about it oh do you want to answer or yeah okay hello thank you very much for a great talk and there is a word that i like that i encountered i think in my own head but i'm sure it's been elsewhere capitalism [7705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7705.139s)

capitalism for all his faults has a very clear goal maximize profit and then all the all the little rivers kind of go into this giant ocean of destruction but i was at a demonstration [[climate change]] thing the other day and one speaker talked about this village that's being flooded another spoke about this tree that's being [7729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7729.5s)

endangered and there's just problem after problem after problem and after a while i tuned out because it's just too much and i can't do anything about all these things and i feel that what our movement really would need is a goal an incentive structure that capitalism has and is great at that binds us because we kind of all [7749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7749.3s)

china there's this quote that i love for everyone who strikes at the roots of evil there are a thousand hacking at the branches and i feel that there's so much branch hacking and very little community like agreements on what is the roots and how can we strike it together and so that's a statement and also i'd love to hear your thoughts about it [7770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7770.78s)

thank you thank you so much for everything you've said so far um i'm not really sure what question i've got but i i think what i'm missing um you started off talking about uh the state with institutions and you've described the effect of the market uh in its destructive growth nature [7800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7800.659s)

if we say that society or civilization comprises the state the market and civil society what function do you see that villages and commoning perhaps in the sense of eleanorstrom's work what function does that have in the in learning resilient patterns to meet the inevitable because we can't [7834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7834.679s)

continue what we're doing what do we do when this doesn't work anymore how do we meet that in the terms of the village uh and and what do you see is commoning what could that be as a verb thank you so much so far i'll raise this question of [[arms race]] that we're really facing in the world that feels very [7875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7875.599s)

scary but how can we de-escalate this uh in a like a practical way what can we do about it which [[arms race]] conversation another one go ahead one more time yeah thank you um so you're talking earlier about that you [7909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7909.92s)

could if you wanted to you could sort of boil down the medic crisis too sociopaths run the world and everyone is basically an enabler to worse those social paths okay so talking about the people that you were discussing there um then have orders you know 10 20 20 orders of magnitude of influence compared to a normal person [7931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7931.88s)

how do we stop producing that how do we stop producing that sort of concentration of power and influence and why is it that most of them come from the united states and is there something there to look at in terms of what can we do to reduce that happening in the united states and how could we avoid it happening in other [7959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=7959.48s)

places by not making the same mistakes that's enough i think and i think we're we need to also get this guy home soon um words foreign there's no amount of new words that you can make that will actually stay new words all the words start to carry and get metabolized by the existing epistemologies and and perceptions um but it's still important to try to communicate in new ways and to make new words because there is the possibility of a gap [8031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8031.659s)

and in that gap there's the possibility of something new coming in to begin to articulate a new theory or to open up a new way of describing something it doesn't actually change the world but it changes what it's possible to communicate in the world and that's enormous that's big [8061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8061.0s)

we we can look around and say well we have to change the parts or we can say we have to change the relationships because we're systems thinkers then we can say well we have to change communication because actually relationships are made of communication but then what's it possible to actually communicate where does that live [8081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8081.82s)

right we're in a room right here where there's all sorts of constraints around what is possible to communicate you guys have been in a different room all week and what it's possible to communicate in this room is different it's not written on the wall somewhere there's no instructions explicitly pasted anywhere but it's everywhere [8105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8105.46s)

was it possible to communicate and arguably the entire movement and structure of a systemic process is shifted inside those invisible possibility realms we'll just stop i have a brief follow-up to that words are incredibly powerful but over time words become culturally burned terms [8139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8139.96s)

like neoclassical economics or fractional reserve banking or [[climate change]] [[climate change]] means something to a certain number of humans and then another group of humans build up antibodies when they hear that term and so it has become no longer a functional term to have real discourse so we need to keep inventing or communicating new terms that describe our reality that can [8169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8169.06s)

broaden the conversation i don't know how to do that but so many of our words immediately set off identity or it just closes the conversation we need words that open the conversation so i love speaking with you guys because i do use words really differently and tone and gesture and it makes it possible to open up different kinds of ways of thinking [8201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8201.34s)

but then you guys come in and you also are bringing in um this wonderful precision and this crispy thing it's satisfying in another way right it feeds another kind of curiosity it allows me to explore in another whole dimension when i hear you speak and then [8231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8231.34s)

maybe maybe i can bring in an invitation to explore different set of textures and possibilities and experiences and maybe those two can start to resonate off each other in ways that are absolutely unique to you and that's i think very exciting so there's part of what is interesting is what i might say or what nate might [8262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8262.78s)

say or what daniel might say but i think what's really fascinating is what we didn't say but what actually formed and connected and tissued in you follow-up while you were speaking i'm going to make a concerted effort that in the future when uh unless i'm at an important uh governmental thing instead of using the word [[climate change]] instead of we're using the word global warming which is a euphemism i'm going to start using the word global heating which is an exact description of the mechanism that's happening and it does it's not use but it's a good description so i'm going to try to use that more i'll jump to the question about how do we stop developing [8321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8321.12s)

people that have um world steering sociopathic orientation and do they disproportionately come from the u.s the answer is kind of but also kind of not in the question of who's the most powerful person in the world it's a weird question because but if one wanted to ask that question would certainly be one of the contenders [8347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8347.16s)

and he's not from the us um and interestingly when i mentioned kissinger who's definitely architect to the u.s system he is not from the us it was him and um zabig new brzezinski and a few of the people that actually architected the post-world war ii system in the u.s were austro-hungarians who were brought over [8367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8367.8s)

who had a history of fighting the ottomans and you know a unique geopolitical advantage um when you look at uh operation paper clip and all of the uh jewish german as well as nazi german scientists the u.s brought over um obviously werner von braun who built the apollo project was uh you know a nazi rocketeer and most of the people at los alamos were jewish scientists from germany there was this long-standing joke that whether the u.s or ussr would win the cold war was which one got the [8415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8415.12s)

better nazi scientists because they each got over a thousand of the scientists in that is why germany was roughly 30 years ahead of both of the other countries going into world war ii um if you go back to as we were mentioning genghis khan or alexander or whatever you can see that the world has had different power centers at different times and so if you [8435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8435.88s)

have an elon musk who's born in south africa of course silicon valley is the place to go currently um but deep mind was founded in uk and is the most advanced commercial [[artificial intelligence]] uh org so what i would say is that there are places where power is concentrated [8458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8458.52s)

and those places attract people who want to play those particular games of power and will be able to play those games of power well increasingly the top tier of the game of power is not national it plays between [[nation state|nation states]] but is not really sovereign to [[nation state|nation states]] how do you stop incentivizing it is a very interesting question uh if the if there was an unbounded [[private property]] ownership the incentive would mostly be gone foreign a fungible currency with which you could get everything and with financial services where pools of the currency [8510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8510.76s)

continue to just make more money on themselves much of the incentive would be gone if you think about a world before fungible currencies where you just had to have real or just say before currencies and you had real commodities a little bit of lumber is useful as you get more and more lumber you get a [8532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8532.3s)

diminishing marginal value on the lumber because you can't use it you can't move it fast enough and it starts to just become like a big pain in the ass the same is true for or anything so you get kind of a diminishing return curve on the unit value of the thing but if i can sell the thing in real time to the market for currency which is an optionality token for any other kind of [8552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8552.88s)

value and then i put interest on that where that thing not only can be converted instantly to any other thing that i want but it goes up exponentially just by sitting on it now there is an infinite incentive to acquire more there's never a diminishing return on acquiring more and in fact if i don't acquire more and the other guy does he's going to beat me [8574](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8574.96s)

so as long as you have a situation where you have a fungible currency with interest in financial services and the primary access to resource mediated by [[private property]] you will not stop incentivizing this thing so those macroeconomic structures have to change those are very very deep i didn't just talk about glassdoal and gold backing i talked [8596](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8596.58s)

about the fungibility of currency itself [[private property]] and interest um but those are examples that if there is going to be a civilization long term there won't still be those structures long term i don't think we will have a replicator right star trek actually didn't solve the problem they said let's have a [8622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8622.66s)

replicator where there's infinite abundance for everybody and because there's infinite abundance for everyone we don't have to deal with scarcity and conflict and nobody actually wants it because there's no differential advantage of having because it all just comes out of the vacuum but it did allow you to a certain [8638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8638.46s)

[[thought experiment]] which was nice we have to figure out how to do that within still physical scarcity and yeah i actually want to thank everybody tonight i'm riding along with us through this um and thank you to nav for hosting us um daniel and anna and johanna for the beautiful food and all the people who participated in making that happen um if there's some of you who haven't spent much time at nov i would like to really invite you to check out what's going on here because this is another place where i see hope i've lived in a lot of communities in my life different kinds of communities i was a california kid and the 70s come on you know i've done that and i would say pretty much 100 of the time that was a fiasco and there's something that's happening here that's very very interesting and i always try to get daniel to talk about [8718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8718.6s)

it how do you do it what's your secret but he won't talk about it because i think there's a something that's outside of the how-to that makes it work did you ever read that book when you were a kid um the phantom toll booth and in the phantom toll booth there's this character milo and his dog and they [8742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8742.3s)

get given this little car and they're trying to figure out how to make the car go and they're pushing all the buttons and turning the keys and doing everything and then finally they sit there in silence because it turns out that the car goes without saying and there's something about nav that has that in it um there's this is not a community [8766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8766.12s)

project this is actually an [[art]] form um so next time we do this we're gonna get you up here daniel and you're not gonna be able to hide back there on the screens because so much of what we're talking about is actually happening right here um so thank you for hosting us and thank [8790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8790.359s)

you nate for coming along and being with us and i like it here i'd be happy to come back yay me too and daniel i know i'm not allowed to hug you but i want to and thanks to all of you so good night everybody and then applause so this is just a thank you back to you [8820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8820.42s)

actually a little poem written here and sitting and listening to what is happening in all of us i think so it goes like this the blues of our times the blues of importance it is hard to know where to where the beginning is in what seems like never-ending crisis and yet the blues calls us to be there with and for each other to be in [8852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8852.52s)

relation to chaos together as the institutional structures are criminally insane and suicidally insane and what we are facing is invisibly right in our face looking deadly fine as we are ghosted by our own love for life being surrounded by ghost telling us this is how it is and yet let not be seduced by the alarm bells pay attention [8883](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWozFWbwGk&t=8883.54s)
