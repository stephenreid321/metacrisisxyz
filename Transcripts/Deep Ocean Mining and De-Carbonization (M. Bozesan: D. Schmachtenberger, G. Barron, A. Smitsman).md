welcome to the integral investing podcast entitled deep ocean mining and decarbonization abundant clean energy is central to the decarbonization of the global economy as we all know but the production of wind solar and geothermal power as well as energy storage requires massive amounts of natural resources such as lithium cobalt nickel and copper to name a few unfortunately the best land wars have [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=31.88s)

already been mined and new resources come from rainforests and pristine landscapes where mining generates large toxic waste so the main question remains how can humanity close the resource gap to achieve the transition to a decarbonized economy by 2050. to address this question i have invited to the podcast jared baron the ceo and founder of the metals company that is [60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=60.96s)

enabling the battery power shift to clean energy and electric vehicles with the slightest planetary touch gerard's mission is to help transition earth from fossil fuels toward a circular resource economy daniel schmittenberg is another brilliant thinker who is also joining us today and whom i have interviewed already before so please listen to that [86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=86.88s)

interview as well he is the founder of the civilization research initiative and an internationally recognized strategic advisor on [[catastrophic risk]] [[exponential tech]] and coordination challenges my co-interviewer today is brilliant system scientist and futurist dr annalus smithman full disclosure i was so impressed with the positive impact of the metals [114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=114.72s)

company after the interview that i went out and wanted to put my money where my mouth is and i purchased their stock daniel i'd like to start with you you're an integral thinker and uh you saw something that i could contribute to your journey our journey by introducing me to george barron um i know we had this [[metacrisis]] long conversation but i would still like to [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=143.58s)

invite you to frame a little bit this conversation from your own um perspective so that we could then dive into gerard's contribution or um yeah in that conversation that i really enjoyed with you and maybe you can link that in the uh show notes here also uh we went in some depth into uh what we [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=169.379s)

call the [[metacrisis]] assessment and what needs to happen so i won't redo that here but just very briefly the concept of the [[metacrisis]] is that there are a lot of catastrophic and some even [[existential risk|existential risks]] facing humanity currently and in the you know years and decades ahead that are novel that are not things that were facing the world at any time previously in human history [192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=192.18s)

obviously the world has always been at risk of super volcanoes and asteroids and things like that but um we were never at risk of ai autonomous weapons issues or nuclear winter or synthetic bio issues or [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] those are things that require uh both that require either [[exponential tech]] or at least very powerful tech like nuclear tech or [216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=216.48s)

industrial tech multiplied by generations of cumulative effects and 8 billion people in the huge amount of resource per capita that is going into the world so rather than just look at there's a climate crisis but there's a lot of other environmental crises there's ocean acidification from both climate but also nitrogen den zones and phosphorus and overfishing and [240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=240.239s)

microplastics and forever chemicals there was just a article published that the pfos and pfas the fluorinated surfactants have passed [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] as defined by the epa and other regulatory agencies in rainwater all around the world um you know like there's so many environmental crises the [[planetary boundary]] framework is a pretty overarching framework to say for the planet to continue to function well soil and biodiversity and temperature and many things have to stay within certain ranges and we're getting very near as the result of industrial technology or cumulative effects over a few centuries and the increasing demand on those the front side of the [[materials economy]] is take stuff from nature faster than [286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=286.44s)

nature can replenish it which looks like deforestation demineralization soil loss overfishing you know etc and then turn it into pollution and trash and waste faster than nature can process it which looks like all of the toxicity and pollution issues to solve that we have to go to a closed-loop [[materials economy]] we're not taking stuff from nature or putting stuff into nature faster than [308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=308.34s)

natural process that's a humongous thing that does not include all of the risks we face because you can go [[closed loop]] and that still doesn't mean we won't have a nuclear clear war it still doesn't mean that we don't create a synthetic bio catastrophes either on accident through lab leaks through gain of function research and things like that or intentionally through [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] or issues associated with ai nanotech or the more advanced [[exponential tech]] meaning um distributed [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] for everyone in a phase where your own weapons and cyber weapons don't take state actors and we're because of [[climate change]] migration which looks to displace hundreds of millions of people in the decade ahead you have a lot more [349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=349.259s)

people who will be much more disenfranchised who also have much more access to do something about that that is catastrophic so the world's fragile for all of these reasons so our basic premise is um we are in a phase where and they're all the result of human technology and the coordination systems because stone age [370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=370.5s)

people just really can't cause biological crisis at a planetary level nor can they cause war that messes everything up nor even externalities that mess everything up so it really is the result of technology and [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] of managing the technology we're not going to regress to a low technology civilization so we have to [390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=390.24s)

get the coordination down where we don't cause uh excessive externalities in the process of our technology and that so that's solving the kind of mistake problems and so that we don't use our technology rivalously i.e exponential warfare towards each other you could say all of the problems are the result of harm that we cause intentionally so [[conflict theory]] and harmony cause accidentally so kind of [[mistake theory]] and so but both mediated by our degree of technological power so at the level of coordination we have to work on resolving underlying sources of conflict and get better at anticipating externalities and mistakes and being able to internalize those um your work through club of rome obviously looks at things like the [433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=433.259s)

limits of growth and uh how does a civilization that has an [[exponential growth]] requirement on the [[financial system]] where each of those dollars are bound to a [[materials economy]] in some ways on a finite planet keep running forever and then also your work through integral investing saying insofar as most of the dollars that represent choices in the [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=455.099s)

world are still moving through the market uh can we think about how we allocate those dollars better and we're not just looking like gdp by itself isn't a good metric because obviously we know why we thought gdp was a good metric but gdp goes up during war and with addiction and health issues lots of things in the same way lowering co2 by itself [475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=475.02s)

isn't a good metric because i could lower co2 by planting a bunch of plants using more nitrogen fertilizers that cause runoff that cause [[dead zone|dead zones]] and oceans faster we need a complex set of metrics that we look at in indices we look at the integral framework um so in the entire [[metacrisis]] there basically the framework we're proposing [496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=496.08s)

is that all of those catastrophes are design constraints that humanity must meet to have a civilization that continues so if we take them all as design constraints and simultaneously we don't want the solution to the catastrophes to be control mechanisms that are so centralized that they create dystopias so we want to avoid catastrophes and avoid dystopias so our [518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=518.159s)

focus you know the kind of think tank that we run our focus is how do we create a [[third attractor]] that is neither catastrophes neither dystopias what is a necessary and sufficient set of solutions to get there and that's a huge topic and a lot of things are involved um and so the reason i'm interested in gerard's [538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=538.92s)

work and the work of uh middle school and we've been friends for some time now i thought it'd be an interesting conversation for you guys to have and i was happy to join it is be obviously [[climate change]] is one of the major environmental issues we're facing it's um it's a particularly hard one because if we look at hfcs or cfcs causing ozone issues or if we look at fluorinated surfactants used for um uh you know water roofing things or whatever you can or pesticides you can potentially change that you have to fight uphill against a multi-billion dollar vested industry but you don't [580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=580.5s)

have to fight a pill against industry itself whereas when co2 as the byproduct of burning hydrocarbons every single industry requires energy and the transition of the energy process itself is more fundamental and deep than any particular area so it's huge either we figure out how to transition off hydrocarbons and produce enough energy [601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=601.62s)

well or we have massive problems the transition off of hydrocarbons is not trivial because if we make solar cells and the associated battery packs to deal with intermittency or whatever else it takes a lot of hydrocarbons to make those and that thing has to run for 10 years or whatever it is to pay that off base so the energy return on energy investment so there's a lot of [623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=623.459s)

deep issues there i have a series with nate higgins where we talk about those things in depth so i won't get into them too much depth here but i will say that there is a very tight correlation between global gdp and global energy use it's been referred to as the garrett relation there are some critiques of that specific formulation but from 1970 till now there's about a 99 correlation [645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=645.0s)

between global gdp and global energy use where all the efficiencies in technology give you about one percent more dollar per joule per year but that one percent increase in efficiency doesn't change the fact that you still have exponential increase in demand to deal with the three percent global interest rate on the finance supply so there's an [[embedded growth obligation]] on on finance to just even be able to keep up with interest let alone quantitative easing or anything else that means that there's an [[embedded growth obligation]] on the total amount of energy and that doesn't mean we just have to be able to keep up the amount of energy we have it means we have to be able to grow the amount of energy obviously that [681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=681.72s)

doesn't get to happen forever we have a finite planets we're gonna have to change the whole global [[financial system]] that's a huge topic can be on the scope of this but the transition so either the work to transition of hydrocarbons is hard right and we're talking about a world that has increasing energy demands if you try to talk about lowering energy demands you [700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=700.68s)

also talk about lowering gdp that has been the stable post-world war ii of how we avoid world war iii that was a huge part of the post-world war ii system the brettonwood system is because we can make this global [[financial system]] and we can exponentiate the monetary supply all the countries can have more stuff they can all have their own growth imperative without taking each other's stuff as [721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=721.8s)

soon as you start to get to a degrowth situation you have some real hard geopolitics to deal with you have some real hard that hitting the poor world more than the rich world or you're trying to do redistribution by force which like all the issues suck so while we deal with some of those deeper issues of the [[embedded growth obligation]] on finance we obviously can't keep doing [741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=741.24s)

the hydrocarbon thing for very long if you have an entire [[world system]] that has been running on hydrocarbons both um oil and coal and natural gas that means you have pipelines and you have internal combustion engines you have an entire infrastructure built on that if you want to get off that you have to build a whole new infrastructure you're talking [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=761.04s)

about electric motors and batteries rather than internal combustion and gas you're talking about electrification of the energy grid and storage for intermittency so one of the issues becomes that for environmental reasons we want to get off hydrocarbons but there are environmental things that there are things that have environmental cost to do that like the [780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=780.0s)

metals needed to make all those batteries and the resources to make the solar cells and the wind plants would ever come from somewhere not only does it take some hydrocarbon energy to do it but you actually have to take you have to have real metals and real other resources to do that thing and so if we look at the need to get off hydrocarbon fuels [799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=799.019s)

combined with the knee the inability to lower the energy demand significantly even if we did all the efficiency measures we're not going to lower it significantly because of all the geopolitical forcing functions then what are the rate limiting issues that often aren't addressed one of them is that to electrify the entire transportation fleet is a big deal the transportation [820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=820.68s)

fleet now doesn't only produce greenhouse gases it also is the number one cause of particulate emissions and who estimates that maybe air pollution is the number one leading cause of death as a source of partial attribution worldwide they recently said that they've anticipated that chemical pollution in the atmosphere including particulate pollution from internal [840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=840.959s)

combustion would be the uh greater killer than [[climate change]] in the decade to come so it's like when we're talking about internal combustion we're talking about problems of oil spills and wars over oil and political destabilizations associated with it as well as co2 as well as particulate emission and all these types of things so it's not a monofocus [863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=863.339s)

and very much ocean health obviously both because of warming and because of ocean acidification uh [[climate change]] has a massive effect on oceans um so if you want the batteries for electrifying all of the transport and then the energy storage that is needed for the electrification of the grid from things that have intermittency where do all those minerals come from the mining [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=886.139s)

of those minerals from surface sources environmentally has real problems because a lot of those surface sources are um uh areas that have some of the last remaining critical biodiversity uh a lot of the ore sources have a lot of unusable co-product that turns into toxic waste and is a major source of problem for [908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=908.459s)

freshwater [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] which are one of the major ones to hit so when i met gerard and heard about their solution which i'll let him share there were a number of things about it that even though it hasn't some environmental cost looking at the entire life cycle of all of the environmental costs and the trade-offs that we can't avoid because there are very hard [929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=929.459s)

trade-offs that you may have to face seems like it is an important and critical topic to get a lot more serious attention and that's why i um wanted to have the conversation well brilliant so um gerard you are the ceo founder you're a serial entrepreneur first of all this is where we connected to uh and you are the ceo and the founder of the metals company and uh so [952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=952.38s)

tell us you know tell us why why go the hard way you're right ariana it is the hard way because getting a new extractive industry uh established at a time where the world is focused on the impact of all extractive industries is well it's a little counter-intuitive and so what we did is we looked at you know accepting the fact that the world is going to need [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=984.54s)

a lot more metal and i think that is on indisputable if we look at the international energy agency you know they say by 2040 we'll need between five and six hundred percent more of these medals to meet the energy needs for the the transition so accepting that fact then we put through the lens of well where where can they come from you know where is the right place to be looking [1009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1009.199s)

for these metals and with the lightest planetary and human touch and we came to the conclusion that the the absolute winner in that race was these uh like i have in my hand and this being a poly metallic nodule and of course we know that 70 of the planet is covered in ocean and and this is why it was so interesting to to blend your integral thinking into this because we [1039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1039.319s)

can't look at the ocean without looking at land in packs and we can't be looking at landing packs without looking at the entire impact of to our planet and so what we started our work on was identifying you know what are the impacts of collecting this resource and turning it into battery metals and if you if you go back to our purpose which we published many years ago it came in [1061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1061.7s)

three steps and one was to identify where are the lowest impact supply of these battery metals to be found and we decided that this was the resource to investigate further and and because we don't have enough metals in the system to allow a pathway to circularity because we do believe that circularity in the long run will reduce the demand for virgin oils and so that's where we [1090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1090.44s)

need to get to so but step one was to get the lowest impact from a planetary environmental and human perspective of supply of these metals into the system and step two of our purpose was then to make sure every single atom that we put into the system stayed there and daniel coined the phase phrase atoms as a service meaning let's put the metals in there but let's make sure we get them [1117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1117.08s)

back and we can recycle them and and um and make sure that they can stay there for many millions of years to come and then finally when extracted industries uh slow down because stage two has been so successful and we are in a circular economy to make sure that we can repurpose our land-based infrastructure to recycle other materials because these nodules are [1140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1140.9s)

abundant in nickel which is a really important metal for our future copper cobalt and manganese but of course there are many other metals that don't have the same um well aren't for aren't the focus of recycling at the moment but they will be as we head towards circularity so that's where we started and the the beauty when we look at this all body [1164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1164.84s)

um and the reason why it's a little bit it takes a bit of adjustment is is of course you know if you look at 70 of the planet is ocean and the abyssal zone is by far the most common environment on our planet it's an area at about almost 4 000 meters and beyond below seawater and this is where these nodules lie and they literally form by precipitating the [1192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1192.5s)

metals that are in the sea water or the sediment upon which they sit so they grow a little bit like a pearl grows by precipitating those metals and and the beauty of that of course is that we when we move them to shore to process them um we kind of reverse that process and we can turn 100 of the mass of this nodule in my hand into usable salable material and that means we [1219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1219.86s)

generate no waste like zero waste and zero tailings and that's a real game changer for the mining and metals industry because last year about um 190 billion tons of waste was generated by the mining industry globally and put that in context about 2 billion tons of waste was generated municipally globally so waste is a really important problem [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1246.14s)

and if you go to increase that by five or six x then an even bigger problem but mother nature did us at an amazing thing by where they located these nodules in the abyssal stone and they literally just lie there on the ocean floor and so to extract them it means we have to pick them up off the surface and we've just completed a very important set of trials [1272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1272.059s)

um our company has been around for around 12 years um but we're working towards the permit to be able to move from exploration phase to extraction phase and so an important part of that were some trials that we completed last year where we had our first production system on our license area so we could we could test our our production means by which we [1299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1299.539s)

lift these nodules um pump them to the production vessel and then we'll move them ashore for processing to turn them into battery metals um but what we were very encouraged by was we had two vessels one one was a 240 meter production vessel known as the hidden gem and it was it was the one that drove the robot on the sea floor [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1324.44s)

and um and it was engineered by one of our big investors and partners all c's who have for the last 37 years been very successful in the pipeline industry for the oil and gas world and and so a lot of expertise from that industry is coming to help us move this industry past the experimental phase into the production phase and and they did an amazing job and it was a [1351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1351.44s)

wildly successful campaign so we're very relieved and pleased about that but we had a second vessel out there and it was science focused we had many scientists on the hidden gem as well but but that second vessel was purely there for monitoring and so we were surveying the area before we touched it during the collection phase and then post the collection phase and you know that was [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1376.159s)

an important part because the results of that work will go into our application that we plan to submit to the the regulator who is the international seabed authority um and will be an important part of the environmental impact study to look at the impact of picking these up and and i'm pleased to say um you know the things that we worry [1397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1397.52s)

about are you know well what's the impact of removing them on biodiversity you know will there be uh loss and how do we mitigate that what would be the impact of the the dust that we generate on the sea floor people notice the plume uh how can we mitigate that how far will it travel think of it as driving a car down a dirt road you'll you'll kick up some [1417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1417.679s)

dust but how far will that dust travel and then the third thing is where to reinject the um the water that we bring up from the seafloor because we separate the sediment from the nodules at the robot but we have to use water to as the transport mechanism and then we have to return that water somewhere um but if i was to to put that into two categories you're talking about [1442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1442.1s)

biodiversity and you're talking about plume and you know speculation by some people was that this plume would travel for large distances and would have a you know a negative impact on the surroundings of the ocean as thousands of miles away but our results were very consistent with the results that mit published some months ago from a a very extensive campaign that they were [1469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1469.82s)

monitoring a year earlier and that is that the plume only rose about two meters above the sea floor and most of it like up to 98 of it stayed in the the test area and so that's good news and it was what we always believed but of course science has to provide the evidence to be able to make these decisions so now of course we have uh we've been [1492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1492.919s)

gathering this environmental data including baseline data for many many years and so now the job is to put all the results of that um into a coherent uh study and put to extrapolate those results into more of a production type environment as well and then to submit that as part of our application to move from exploration into a phase that we're we're able to [1522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1522.38s)

lift the nodules and move them to shore and process them and and sell the results and and so you know we've always believed that we can compress the range of impacts by very significant amounts and we've been funding a lot of research to that point we have had many articles appear in peer-reviewed journals like the the journal of cleaner production that [1548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1548.48s)

published our co2 paper that said showed that you can reduce co2 emissions by more than 90 percent when you build a battery cathode using these rocks compared to the land-based alternatives the fact that we can generate no waste you know the fact that we we will reduce the amount of water required fresh water by 90 percent when we process nodules compared to land-based doors the fact [1575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1575.9s)

that we don't need to move indigenous communities and that's one of the really big focuses particularly for the nickel product i mentioned nickel is very important about half of the economics come from nickel and if you look at the supply of nickel globally it's declining the growth in nickel is coming from indonesia and [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1598.1s)

that's in the form of these nickelaterates since the you know you can see a green picture behind me on the wall or it's actually a moss wall but imagine that is a a very biodiverse rainforest in indonesia and under it lies a lot of nickel so to get to that nickel you've got to build a heap of infrastructure you're going to go in and tear down the rainforest and move all [1620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1620.9s)

the topsoil all of which of course means destroying carbon sinks you then need to to dig up this nickel lateride ore unfortunately when you expose it to weather the runoff is chromium six plus which of course poisons everything in this path and then you're doing all of that looking for like one to two percent of the material is usable the other 90 plus percent of it is waste and you have [1646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1646.039s)

to do something with that waste and it's not just any old waste it's toxic waste so you can't you know you have to treat it and manage it and um so you know the it's a horrible situation we find ourselves in and that's why we have to be looking at new frontiers because turning a blind eye to the current practices is not a viable alternative you know we have to be working with full [1670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1670.159s)

knowledge and and you know you can't pretend that the batteries in your electric car are made with sustainable metals you can't just think oh yeah i don't have to worry about that as as citizens of our planet we do have to worry about it and we have to be looking through the lens of you know a full life cycle analysis and say well what are what are these set of broad impacts and [1695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1695.12s)

how do they compare to the alternatives and then we have some judgments to make you know and the judgments are do we want to keep destroying the most biodiverse carbon sinks on our planet you know robbing indigenous communities pushing them out of their home habitats also we can you know just meet the insatiable demand for the energy transition or do we want to think a bit [1716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1716.6s)

harder about this and and look for something that is a whole lot you know better for our planet and for the humans living on it wow thank you so much and you know i want to summarize some of those things and ask you some further questions because i think what you're doing is really pioneering work and it's really important so just first for location [1739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1739.52s)

um if i understand it correctly this is in the in the waters of the republic of now is that correct no no we're actually in international waters now rules are public is our sponsor because right we wind our mind back 50 years ago this industry almost got started um there were four different consortiums involving lockheed martin and mitsubishi [1764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1764.48s)

sinatomo bp and shell were involved and they started to put um efforts together to collect these rocks and they were successful it was really pioneering stuff i mean we've just had a very successful trial but we've benefited from the development of the offshore industry and all the engineering advancement in the last 50 [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1786.62s)

years but 50 years ago they built the system and the robots to go down and hoover these up and rio tinto build a processing plant on shore it was all successful but but the problem is 50 years ago the world had not agreed who owned the oceans where do my borders begin and end and so it was when henry kissinger wrote a letter to all of the ambassadors of the un saying uh we'd [1811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1811.399s)

like to lay claim over this area it'll be good for the world trust us on that of course all the ambassadors got together and said that doesn't sound too equitable and and so the un stopped it so everyone had to pause and then that was agreed finally on where the borders begin and end when unclosed which stands for the united nations convention of the law of the sea was put into place in [1837](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1837.38s)

1982 and that basically said as a sovereign you own everything within 12 miles of your coastline and you have an economic right to everything within 200 miles but beyond that it's not yours in fact it's everybody's it's deemed the common heritage of humankind and it will be governed by the international seabed authority and so we are in international waters but but to be able to claim an [1861](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1861.14s)

area you either need to be a signatory to one class and a member of the international seabed authority which we are not or be sponsored by a member and of course they really wanted developing countries to be involved because typically it's the wealthy nations who have the resources and the expertise um to be able to you know lead the [1882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1882.919s)

charge yet the poor developing countries you know are left out wondering well what happened there whereas this is a way that a developing nation in our case nauru um we also have a similar relationship with the kingdom of tonga and kirivas but this is a way that those developing countries who've had zero contribution to [[climate change]] who've done nothing about helping perpetuate this climate crisis that we're in that allows them to participate and to be able to learn new skills to create jobs to earn royalties of course and also play an important part in in providing one of the important solutions so we're about a thousand miles off the coast of mexico and so it's a long way [1928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1928.88s)

from anything um but in proximity to nauru is not one of the criteria we could have equally had um one of the african countries sponsor our application or i'm really glad you clarified that especially because i'm calling from the republic of mauritius so here it's also a small island developing state and i [1952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1952.1s)

think what you're bringing up here is is very important to you politically but also in terms of the socio-economic inequalities in addressing this and so i have a few more small questions so that everyone was listening is really getting a fuller picture here i addressed many of the key issues around an environmental impact assessment with the eia and there's also the impact of sound [1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1973.64s)

uh in terms of the impact for the whales and for the dolphins so i'd love to hear your views on that as well and then i'd really love to hear from you whether you took the compliance route of complying with regulations or you took the corporate sustainability leadership route of saying look we're not just looking only to comply with what's expected in order to get a license where [1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=1996.62s)

we're actually advocating for higher standards and we're really willing to use ourselves here as a case study to then educating inform others of how we can do this in a way that is regenerative and it's the least amount of impact with that big a planetary vision that you you know describe so well no great questions uh on the topic of sound you know we've run a very [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2021.46s)

extensive sound uh campaign with our trials that have just recently completed and so we we look forward to publishing the results early indications are that they're all very manageable most of the sound of course happens on the surface but there is you know there's noise generated by the transportation of nodules up the pipe and but there are there are there are means that we can [2050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2050.139s)

dampen that noise substantially if required but as it stands now we're very encouraged by the results that we've seen from those recent trials and so we don't think noise just just remember we're not breaking anything on the sea floor like these nodules literally lie there so as long as though we're having to drill or blast which is conventionally what happens you know in [2073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2073.48s)

the oil and gas or the mining industry and so you know very different scenario um so going back on to the path that we took i think it's really important for people to understand one thing never before has an industry had so much focus before it got started by a regulator like normally industries get started and then people try and regulate [2102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2102.82s)

them so here we are the international seabed authority it's made up of 167 member countries plus the european union it's been established since 1994. like if you if you were i don't know greenpeace and you had to imagine had to imagine a regulatory environment i imagine you'd probably say it's something like this now of course they'll probably say it's [2129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2129.579s)

not quite good enough but today but but never before has an industry had so much focus before it's got started so that's encouraging but the other thing i'd like to make the point of is that don't think if it doesn't happen under the control of the regulator the international seabed authority don't think these assets won't be exploited [2152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2152.38s)

and that's the opportunity for the world today the fact that you've got a regulator in place and the fact that you've got a company like ourselves i'd like to say we're really responsible corporate citizen we've there are guidelines that have been laid down by the regulator on what we should be looking at from an environmental management perspective [2178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2178.72s)

because the mandate of the international seabed authority is really clear it's to put in place exploration and exploitation regulations a term that's adopted from the land-based mining industry while protecting the marine environment and so we they provide very strong guidance on what should happen but we always said we actually want to see that and up at [2203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2203.98s)

another level and the good news there is that when you set a standard then generally that becomes a level that people have to attain or exceed and so i think it's really a positive thing that a we have a regulator that everyone's playing by the rule book at the moment and secondly that companies like us are striving towards excellence you know when we put [2233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2233.22s)

together our environmental um plan we didn't go and hire a heap of scientists so it could be company prepared we went and sought the very best experts from each discipline and so we have you know if you go to our website you'll see the array of institutions and universities we have you know mit helping us we have the university of [2258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2258.46s)

hawaii we have the national oceanography center the natural history museum it's a really broad range of leading institutions who have put their expertise and with the help of our money i mean by the time we complete this we will have spent uh over 100 million dollars i mean it's a lot of money we've invested in this it's the largest fully integrated you know ocean research [2282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2282.82s)

research program ever done and so you know we did that because we we we knew that people would say ah yeah but you did it the metals company whereas we can say uh hang on yeah we bought expertise in from all of these very upstanding institutions who um you know have done the work independently they're free to publish their results you know we don't put any [2305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2305.26s)

handcuffs on anyone we now have the csiro and uh the equivalent agency in new zealand working with us on putting together an adaptive management plan and that's going to be exciting too because their recently completed work uh on the great barrier reef is there for everyone to see it's amazing the rehabilitation that is happening because there's so many things to worry about but what are [2330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2330.16s)

the important things to worry about and so you know what csiro and and and then the equivalent agency in new zealand are helping us with is is deciding what are the things to measure what are the the boundaries that we need to be mindful of we move through the production process so so i'd like to think you know we took a set of guiding principles and we improved on them and you know knowing [2356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2356.68s)

that we're going to have the eyes of the world focused on us which is something we're very very comfortable with and and you know that adaptive management system we we pair it with our digital twin because i sometimes hear people say well how on earth will we know what you're doing a thousand miles offshore 4 000 meters below sea level we won't know what's going on there but [2380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2380.98s)

but it's the exact opposite i don't know whether you've ever tried to get near a land-based mind but it's impossible you're met with barbed wire and machine guns depending which country you're in um whereas we want to let people including the regulator have eyes and ears to exactly what we're doing so people can see the low level of impact that's being generated and so [2402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2402.339s)

it's a different approach so now that we'll address the the environmental issues and you know we know what we're talking about our listeners are the target audience our investors and uh so this is your floor what do you need from investors how can we support your work moving forward thank you i see daniel wanting to to [2430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2430.359s)

interject but there were a handful of environmental topics you touched on that i just think are important to take one step further before we get into uh the business you know mind so broad was just recently mentioning coral and obviously the coral bleaching and die of issues and how critical coral are to life in the oceans is a topic [2456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2456.94s)

everyone's aware of um one of the other than grayberry reef one of the major centers of coral in the world is off the coast of indonesia which is the other place that the nickel can come in when gerard was saying that 90 plus percent of the ore that gets extracted is a waste product and most of that being a toxic waste product the waterways that that goes [2476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2476.079s)

into if the mining tailing dams break which happens all the time like just look into um mining pollution toxicity mining tailing uh dams breaking just you do a bit of the study who's mentioning you know 190 billion tons of waste for mining compared to you know municipal wasted a couple billion tons this is not just looking at that being a generally [2497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2497.02s)

toxic issue but specifically in indonesia where both the tropical rainforest on the surface and the um end of the waterway where the waste would end up going are one of the most uh biodiverse on-surface and land areas in the world so that's just a really critical thing to you know think of think about um we know that when we're talking about fracking or tar sands it's because the really easy oil has already been mostly used up but nobody would go drill offshore for oil if there was easy oil onshore nobody would do fracking our tar sands but you use up the easy stuff and then you get into diminishing returns we're in diminishing returns in hydrocarbons which is why we're doing [2541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2541.599s)

that stuff which is another reason we have to switch energy sources quickly um but we're also in diminishing returns on so many sources of metals where the highest grade ores that were closest to the surface got used up that were easiest to get to the ones that are left or lower grade ore which means more toxicity or and much harder to get to areas which means having to penetrate [2561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2561.46s)

deeper into big rainforests and it's not simply the impact let's say we're talking about going into indonesia or into the amazon for mining assets uh it's not simply how much of the rainforest has to be destroyed for the road in and the mine i was talking to some environmental scientists who are working on [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and we're looking at biodiversity writ large doing meta-analysis on the biodiversity metrics they said that the single most critical factor that they have found for biodiversity in terms of if there was one thing that was going to damage biodiversity the most it's the first road that enters into an otherwise large virgin area because there is a high initial cost to develop the first road in the initial infrastructure once that's developed for some purpose there's a lower barrier of entry to be able to go in for other purposes that don't have quite as high a margin so you can go in for logging and go in for animal agriculture and other things like that once that's developed but the initial one will usually be [2621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2621.7s)

developed for mining or for oil or gas or something that has a much higher price point so it's not only when you're looking at how much carbon is released and how much carbon zinc is damaged in the process of destroying that surface rainforest and the biodiversity but how much that opens up in terms of all the other industries that's a really critical topic and in [2642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2642.7s)

this particular situation you don't have a similar thing because the seabed authority is not regulating all c mining as the same thing they're all very different and there aren't a lot of other uses for the sea floor that once you open it up now people want to go start taking all the other stuff there's not there's silt right it's like there's salt and then there happens to be these [2661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2661.18s)

nodules that's another point that i wanted to open up is that um the regulation being proposed and metals coast position is not pro ocean mining it's a much more nuanced thing that says uh pro collection of these poly metallic modules that happen to be not just profitable metals but key metals for the energy transition off of hydrocarbons [2687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2687.46s)

that is a critical thing that are also relatively low impact both because they're in an area that has low biodiversity they're in an area where the same biodiversity is indexed in areas that won't be mined or affected and where they don't actually have to go into the crust or do any kind of drilling or cutting there are lots of [2706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2706.119s)

other types of ocean mining where the cost benefit environmentally doesn't make sense makes sense to do surface mining or to really avoid that source as a whole so when you say ocean mining as a binary it doesn't make any sense right it's like saying are you pro or anti-ai will depend on the application there's really terrible applications or you pro or anti-synthetic biodefense in the [2727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2727.54s)

application so that's just another topic i wanted to bring up it and the last one is when i was a young environmentalist and i would hear about something like mine the oceans that term would just freak me out right or like mind the rainforest or and i didn't have the sense that the kid the tv that i was seeing [2751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2751.18s)

that add-on or the computer or phone now that i'm seeing it on requires a whole bunch of metals that communicate over satellites fueled by a lot of energy that came from a [[supply chain]] that comes from somewhere and what the trade-offs associated are and so uh the binary of should we mine the oceans or not mine the oceans if we [2772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2772.48s)

could just say yes let's just not and there was no alternative in you know all negative thing that would happen of course that would be like yes let's just not but if it is selective highly regulated mining of a certain type in a certain area for certain purposes or if not doing that then you have one of a couple options so you don't get the metals that are needed [2795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2795.04s)

for the batteries and either now you have to get them from the surface sources and now you're dealing with look at what the surface source is for the nickel cobalt manganese etc are and look at the fact that they are largely things that produce much more toxic waste than the nodules do they had to have more effects on surface biodiversity and in more biodiversity critical zones of the world or you say well let's just not have batteries and let's keep all the particular transmission in the co2 and so then you can make a makeup answer called let's just need less energy well that's cute but that's just not going to happen unless you get rid of a lot of humans or want the war that goes along [2836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2836.8s)

with that and so if you really take the trade-offs and say until someone can present how to radically degrow gdp and and or radically decrease energy without needing to decrease gdp neither one of which have real viable solutions in the short term then that energy has to come from somewhere and if you want to get off [2862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2862.3s)

hydrocarbons then where do those metals come from those are real questions and so i want the best environmental answers for that i'm willing for them to not be the best economic answers they just have to be viable enough that the people motivated by the economics are not motivated to go to war otherwise because of course poor economics can mean disproportionate harm [2884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2884.319s)

to poor people it can mean uh a basis for war over resources um but what i would want the environmental um scientists and environmental groups and thinkers to do is to say okay let's really look at the entire trade-off space clearly and well and let's make sure that we if we're going to object to [2908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2908.859s)

something that we have a comprehensively better proposal that we actually know how to enact if our better proposal has no inactibility like let's just decrease the total amount of energy the world keeps by a lot that's not actually a solution so from what i can tell and i would change my position on this if anyone presented something better [2928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2928.319s)

there is no realistic way to decrease the energy demands and there is no realistic way to get off hydrocarbon without increasing the metal lands and given that we're looking at the trade-offs between sourcing none of which are perfect but in this particular situation seemed quite clear for some of the baseballs um what a beautiful way to summarize what has been said and also from an integral perspective so i really appreciate that particularly because you know we need to make sure that we don't look in a naive way um into what needs to happen next and so those blind spots have to be addressed and um thank you um gerard i mean the reason [2973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=2973.06s)

why i went into the cost and the investor the financial support was because i truly see that that you're doing at least as far as humanly possible in our culture and so within having said that and thank you for the summary daniel i think uh i'd like to know next from you gerard how can we those of us who have financial means and focus on that [3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3000.599s)

support your work given the fact that you are so integrally uh looking at addressing those issues thank you thank you so so we're really about building a community that supports this movement and you know i was i always enjoy any opportunity to be on a a medium with daniel because he really does tap into a set of thinkers who are [3031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3031.319s)

prepared to think a little bit you know deeper into the true issues and have a trade-off conversation and and obviously adding integral thinking into you know this and that being able to access that community i see is really you know important as we try and find people that want to come and put their shoulder to the wheel because as daniel said you know it's complex and also you know [3059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3059.7s)

as as he said at the moment this seems to be the best solution it's something we always said to our stakeholders you know if we we have a we have a a set of requirements that we see as need to be met to keep going on this and one of them is making sure that we do satisfy the requirement to not harm the environment [3087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3087.18s)

you know there's nothing that has zero harm but but if we found that this ecosystem you know would be damaged such that it changed the function of the oceans then we would have some stop moments we'd be like oh sorry guys um we've got new information that needs us to to pivot to a new look for a new extractive uh new supply to these important metals but so far all of the [3112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3112.92s)

news is encouraging on that so we feel confident but what we really need uh people who want to come and join us on this story and and that includes people like you mariana who are prepared to access your network to help us communicate this important story um we obviously uh we're a public company now we're listed on the nasdaq [3137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3137.46s)

our ticker is tmc for the metals company um we've had a pretty rough ride i got to tell you it's been a a hellish riot as a public company um you know as a private company we'd raised money at about a two billion dollar valuation and then we we became a three billion dollar company but today we're we're a fraction of that yet we have a really sticky solid register you [3162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3162.599s)

know we just raised more money recently and that mainly came from internal shareholders um so you know we feel confident about our financial future and all of this the decreasing value of tmc the public company is at a time when our assets our licenses are becoming more and more valuable you know the first area that we're developing is nori area d and that [3187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3187.38s)

represents about 22 percent of our defined resource because we've we've already identified about 1.6 billion tons of these on two of our license areas and so we're we're compliant with the canadian resource reporting standard and the resource certainty is really high because they're two-dimensional they lie on the ocean floor so you can see them [3211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3211.38s)

but the the economics for that first block nori area d that's 22 percent of our defined resource has a net present value today of more than 15 billion dollars you know and and if we were a land-based project at the same stage of development the value of our company would be between about 0.2 and 0.7 times that nav so 0.2 or 0.7 times 15 billion dollars [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3240.48s)

yet our value is not that it's it's more like it's like point zero one percent of the nav and so a bit more than that but 0.015 so that seems wrong so there's a disconnect um you know at about 60 of the register is really sticky like people like myself and all c's and our largest shareholder from uh san francisco a family office who've been you know so really committed [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3271.5s)

people who are not looking at this as a trade to make money that they're in this for the long term and so what we really want to do is to get more people to come and join us on this journey to buy the shares to share us into their community such that we can you know have community discussions like this so we can find people who have a willingness to come [3296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3296.52s)

and learn more and to come and support this new industry and it's very rare that you can be at the beginning of a new industry but that's where we are like and this is a really exciting time because you know it's it's one analogy is you know offshore oil and gas once upon a time there was no offshore oil and gas and then in the blink of an eye 30 of oil and gas [3321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3321.42s)

supplies came offshore i think it could be even more aggressive when it comes to uh these metals when it comes to nickel and cobalt and manganese that more more supply could come out of the ocean so i'm very encouraged by that so um so yeah that's i think there are many many different ways and um you know i think getting people to buy the stock and getting people to to talk [3350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3350.88s)

about the story and to come and be inquisitive and and to want to learn more and allow us to to talk to their networks um important networks of of thinkers uh is the areas that can help us most we are talking to a broad range of strategic partners now because one of the ways companies like ours finance their future activities is by inviting [3379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3379.44s)

other companies to come and invest at the asset so not into our topco because obviously we think the stock is hugely devalued um so we don't want to be issuing more shares what we want to do is to unlock some of that 15 billion dollars of net present value and so you know i mentioned at our last earnings call that we're talking to a variety of strategic [3402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3402.54s)

names about earning into those assets and and that's a way that you know we can avoid dilution uh invite strategic names in who can help us with capital and expertise as needed to start developing these important assets well thank you so very much gerard and you know as an investor i know how values uh decrease like that and i i can only imagine you know what you've been [3432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3432.96s)

going through over the past uh 12 years but daniel had a question that goes in that direction daniel 102. yeah just in in case it's not obvious do you want to say why you believe the stock value went down because obviously if you're asking people to invest it's based on the idea that stock value is going to go up and in addition to investment what else would create a [3454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3454.14s)

turnaround in that yeah most certainly um look uh the the main issue that people have about you know our valuation is the fact that the final regulations have not been adopted yet so at the moment we have exploration licenses and the that allows us to apply for an exploitation license over those same defined areas and so so if you like we've been busy putting the cart beside [3485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3485.28s)

the horse along the way um maybe even in front of the horse sometimes but the final exploitation code is due to be adopted later this year and that is they are the rules that will allow us to then submit our application and move from exploration to extraction phase and so obviously the moment that happens that massively opens up the value of [3511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3511.46s)

those assets we we already have our first production asset the hidden gem so the boat that we are out uh on our license area with last year that was owned and operated by all seas will also be our first production asset when once we receive the commercial permit to move ahead and so i think that's the main gating item now of course there were some other things when we became a [3537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3537.78s)

public company you know we had you know a short report came out we had a funding short for one about the major investors who'd committed to investing um uh went bankrupt and so that was a problem for us um we we went public via a merger with a spac which in 2020 was all the rage when we announced our deal on march 4 2021 we were kind of the last back to get [3565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3565.38s)

through the gates and the sec really turn their focus on sparks because there are a lot of crazy businesses that went public uh through spax you know i would never invest in them because they weren't underwritten by tangible assets you know they were they were pipe dreams um so that meant we went public thinking we were going to raise about 600 million dollars but the redemption rate of ounce [3591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3591.24s)

back went from you know low single digits in the year 2020 all of a sudden in 2021 redemption rates went back to normal which were very very high so a lot of the money that we thought we were raising uh either redeemed or in the case of our defaulting investor defaulted so it meant we raised 137 million dollars instead of 600. so that meant you know that was a real you know kick in the teeth and we had to decide well what do we do do we do we proceed and remain a private company or do we proceed and become a public company we decided to stay on the public path we um it provided us enough money to keep the program on track and and amazingly thank you to an amazing team we've kept the program on track so we still are [3639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3639.359s)

committed to first production at the end of 2024. now we're at the beginning of 2023 so at the end of next year we've for some reason we lost gerard i see that so while he was uh describing uh his uh challenges with uh with uh you know a startup i could only refer to or think back to what we experienced with the energy turn around startup and i [3680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3680.46s)

originally wanted to have the you know co-founder be with us because he would have brought a different and you know regulatory aspect from an industry that is just you know starting to uh get involved in how the current regulators are basically um doing everything and anything to prevent you from uh from being successful so [3701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3701.4s)

gerard actually elaborated that so as a serial entrepreneur is and an investor for more than 30 years i i so can sympathize with what gerard has been going through and you know i know and if i remember correctly you invested several uh tens of millions of your own money into this company because you believe in it and that's basically the best way the best [3725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3725.819s)

confirmation for investors if the founder you know puts um all of his uh eggs into one basket then that's the way to go and so i can only encourage everyone and anyone to who is listening to this to really uh join forces with us so annelus daniel do you have any more questions for uh for gerard i had one quick thing i was going to say is at one point gerard said [3756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3756.359s)

um don't think that the resources won't be uh collected or exploited at some point through some process um the orientation for growth and the need of metals and growth seems and the you know nodules having a straightforward method to collect them that has only been legally hung up um and the market demand on those continuing to increase makes it seem really crystal clear those will become a collected asset so then the question is how environmentally well is it regulated and let's say you know we already see people working on [3801](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3801.9s)

um uh geoengineering involving um solar radiation aerosols in the upper atmosphere that might have unbelievably huge environmental consequences out of a kind of like terror associated with [[climate change]] when you start to get in really back against the wall positions then you move forward in less conscious ways and i can [3826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3826.92s)

see the world moving forward in a less conscious way with regard to this when it becomes you know critical that it's needed late i would actually really rather have the regulatory pathway be quite strict like i would like very strict environmental regulation i would like other submersibles down there that are monitoring the ocean quality and monitoring the plumes and monitoring the [3849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3849.54s)

biodiversity making sure everything is good which means that i would like a company that is actually really invested in that helping to open up the initial regulatory pathway that says actually we're not trying to talk you into using lobbying efforts uh decreasing regulatory standards we actually want you to increase the regulatory standards so that then [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3868.319s)

whether it's the major chinese mining companies or it's lockheed or any of the other companies that might not have as much environmental uh motivation themselves they're actually both they're now bound to do it by a regulatory process that has transparency so um there does seem to be an inevitability argument and then what is the best way to do it it feels like an [3891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3891.059s)

important part of this that i wanted to also mention thank you daniel and i'd like to um also you know give the word again to jarred who was cut off from uh you know using this beautiful technology of the future from our conversation so to finish this sentence in terms of you know the hard time that he went through and uh how he would like to move [3914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3914.16s)

forward and uh how we can support him no thank you well well i was just finishing up saying that you know despite the uh the headwinds you know we've kept uh a team very very glued together around the mission like mission alignment is 10 out of 10 with our entire team and you know in a very hot employment labor market you know we've been able to keep people in a [3944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3944.64s)

really difficult you know difficult industry that's often under attack because they're so mission aligned with the importance of this and you know it's also very exciting being part of a new industry and and it takes a little bit of stubbornness and determination to be able to stay the course on this one when you have so many you know um you know hand grenades coming at you from different directions but but you know the prize is a big one from a planetary perspective you know i've caught the fiscal stuff will work off work out for itself we are operating in the for-profit environment um you know one of the things i didn't mention is you know the pace at which we [3988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=3988.38s)

have been able to complete our science you know we have been you know we've had boats on the water approaching 900 days now you know with the focus being science and that's because we've had a you know we know how to develop commercial projects but we've had a very integrated privately funded science program whereas a lot of these science programs tend to be funded by grants a [4013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4013.52s)

lot of the other contractors you know they'll do a campaign this year another campaign a couple of years time i mean in 2020 we had our boat on the water four times these were campaigns that ran six to eight weeks in 2021 we had a we ran five campaigns similar time frames so we've been really really busy busy and we were able to really pin out his back during covert as well because we'd [4039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4039.319s)

raise some money privately and we were well funded to and we knew that it would be a a challenging time covert but we created this bubble you know and we didn't lose a single day through covert and we were able to achieve amazing progress um that allowed us to become you know to get through the public uh company process so so look it's a uh it's a [4061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4061.46s)

company that that i think you know will benefit by being exposed to you know this community and so i really thank you for giving me the opportunity of of talking today and to exposing the story to an important group of um critical thinkers so thank you thanks so much iran also daniel for you know really mapping out that complexity and that's often gets flattened and [4090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4090.92s)

sharabad really stood out for me in this conversation that you said join us on the journey um that is also for essential for cultivating trust uh because there's transparency in there is openness so perhaps in closing can you let us know some of the ways in which we can join you on the journey i started already exploring your [4113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4113.299s)

um your vimeo channel and going through the videos which was really informative you know other ways that we can join you on the journey well i i think we have a really rich um resource center at our website at metals.co and if you go to the um uh to the the faqs there you'll see us address many of the things that are probably going to cross your mind you [4143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4143.179s)

know the the tricky questions about why we're doing this and uh and impacts and so on and you know as you mentioned we have a rich video library we've you know we had uh filmographers on the boats you know we we always do because we really want to catalog this journey so people can at least feel they're part of it um and so you know come up the knowledge curve but we really need action as well [4168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4168.799s)

you know it's if if the result of this call is that everyone's a little bit better informed then i failed i really need people to get involved and how you can get involved is uh send me an email at jared metals.com buy the stock think about your community that you can tell about this important story you might have people that just you think could have their own platform [4194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4194.42s)

that we could do a repeat session such as we're doing today if it can reach a broader audience and i know that when daniel first suggested mariana to me it was it it was because of your work with the integral uh thinking it was because of your work with club of rome and it was because of your network you know around the world that he really said this is a really important session jared [4220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4220.64s)

and and you know i'm i'm grateful for that because you know sometimes it feels like it's one conversation at a time that obviously if that can lead to a thousand to a million then that's the journey that i really need some help from people on and and and you know we're making tremendous progress on the project as i mentioned i think we're really well squared away there [4245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4245.96s)

um but this the the challenge of communicating this to the broader market and the investing community is something that clearly look at our stock price we haven't done well enough that but the business that underlies it is is in great shape and we feel very confident about the direction we're heading we don't have all the answers yet you know and that's why [4267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4267.199s)

we're spending the money and you know we're pro we're we're moving ahead i think in a very precautionary sense but with a commercial imperative because you know this this crisis is not something to think about it's here you know we we really need to be taking uh progressive steps to be dealing with it and you know we tend to be you know we are solutions oriented and we you know [4291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4291.98s)

we think this is going to be one of the most important um [[dance|dances]] certainly to the metal crisis and so yeah daniel one of the things i actually really like about this this particular situation that i find [4310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4310.82s)

interesting about it that almost all entrepreneurs would find infinitely frustrating as i like that it actually has to pass through a regulatory process that is looking at environmental and social and other forms of externality possibilities first because that's actually something that i propose as necessary for all industries in the world moving forward to make it to the [4330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4330.679s)

[[metacrisis]] if you look at gerard was saying this is kind of unique in that typically a company will move forward advance new stuff and then the problems get regulated later obviously four out of five doctors used to choose camel cigarettes and uh it wasn't until you know so much lung cancer death that finally regulation happened there and the same was true [4352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4352.52s)

with pesticides and ddt and whatever with leaded gasoline um you remember in the 50s people spraying ddt on everything right it was just mosquito on themselves food and and rachel carson had to work so hard and then when we finally banded all the harm had already occurred um but the 20 30 80 years that it takes [4373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4373.52s)

afterwards with things that have faster and faster effects like effects of synthetic bio and ai it just won't work by the time that the harm is that clear the world will be destroyed so we actually have to move to a place where with new technologies that can have such a rapid effect on the world we do the process to anticipate the unanticipated and thor effects and figure out the [4394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4394.28s)

right paths for the commercialization of the technology with a regulatory process so that is actually something that i think the world will have to move to to make it out of the [[metacrisis]] of course that means we have to have regulation that is both effective and competent and that we trust and there's lots of things involved in that so i want to see super strict regulation here i want to see a [4414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4414.5s)

company that really cares about that with independent oversight from from mit and oceanographic institutes looking at it um and i do want to see very complex comparisons of the trade-offs between surface mining and alternative energy storage technologies and all of those things one of the things that had me actually make friends at gerard and [4436](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4436.159s)

erica is not on the call but it's brilliant uh and why they kind of picked the name medalsco is like the moment we can get these medals from recycled sources because there are enough metals we'll switch and not do infancy sources if there was a better source we would move to that the key is actually how do we create a [[closed loop]] material economy closed material economy writ large takes [4457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4457.0s)

a ton of energy lots of big challenges so if to survive [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] we need to make a [[closed loop]] [[materials economy]] so we're not making anything conversion resources and turning it into trash and pollution and we have to make a closer [[materials economy]] with renewable energy then being able to boot the renewable energy system to close up everything else is one of [4478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4478.64s)

the first kind of big keys to that and i think one of the places where challenges occurred like you know i know other major multinational type companies that would invest less in science and more in lobbying the international seabed authority and uh other groups i'm sure will work to do that i actually really like a group that is focused on the science to work [4501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4501.08s)

um you know the process formally um but obviously when there's a negative environmental narrative that makes it risky for investors and i one of the things that i respect is that you know they have invested in having some of the best ocean scientists and conservationists on their team working on how do you in order to do this well [4524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4524.239s)

how do you make it different and it has involved changes to the original tech significantly based on how to really do it properly i had a conversation with gerard and gregory stone around that there was like really interesting topics of how to make sure that the thermal clients and the saline clients are protected as vertical movement is happening how do you test all the heavy [4545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4545.179s)

metals in this sediment to make sure how do you make sure that the biodiversity is indexed well just all those topics depth and they have held the position that any environmental scientists or environmental groups that want to come talk with them and have an earnest conversation privately or publicly can privately and they won't comment on it [4562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4562.219s)

publicly in front of an open debate happy to do so and i would feel very happy to see anyone do that and do it with the frames that say not just do the thing or don't do the thing but really engage with the complexity of the trade-offs of the space and um in so far as anyone really could propose a comprehensively better [4583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4583.4s)

approach to meet the world's needs i know that this company would look at how to leverage its assets to change would you why i like most people um and if no one does have a comprehensively better approach than i think being good environmentalists obligated saying wow if this is the best inactible approach we can currently see for the environment writ large and we [4602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4602.96s)

don't just care about the environment of this area or of this metric but comprehensively then let's be clear on that and so the other thing i would invite is anyone who has environmental concerns to actually engage in conversation um not just you know hit pieces but like actually have a debate publicly or reach out privately [4625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4625.1s)

um and uh you know whether gerard or the scientists on the team they're happy to have those conversations and happy to publicly you know document uh those conversations absolutely brilliant well we are coming slowly but surely to the end of this extraordinary podcast i've [4646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4646.58s)

learned so much and i'm deeply grateful to be connected with you and uh be a tiny little vehicle for taking the world a word out into a world that needs to get better informed and maybe as it just is a not very um small side note andalus and i are members of the resource transition group together with other major members of the [4674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4674.5s)

club of rome it's a european initiative and which is the reason why she and i were very excited to engage in this conversation and we're deeply grateful for this beautiful example of addressing the [[metacrisis]] by bringing in people who have shifted already their minds and are providing solutions and are open to the regulatory necessities that this transition require in order to create a [4705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4705.08s)

better more integral world for us so i would like to thank all of you for being part of this and uh and i couldn't be more grateful uh for knowing you and i know the world is better because you exist because we all know that on a round planet there is no choosing upsides we're all in the same boat and so please engage with us in a positive way to create a better world thank you [4729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrwk_fKtco&t=4729.739s)

everybody
