welcome to the stola the stoah is a digital campfire where equal hear and dialogue about what matters most at the night's edge what's happening now music okay check-ins i'm a little nervous maybe about twenty percent and there's adjacent desire not to seem nervous and then there's this associated existential chill that's just riding through all this a [40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=40.82s)

welcome to the stoah i am peter lindbergh the stewart of the storm and it still has a place for us to cohere and dialogue about what matters most at the knife edge of this moment is it everyone can hear me fine or is there some kind of leg and if i can get some thumbs up thumbs up okay cool as soon as you feel like i'm mind okay let me just audio fine video lang you [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=69.56s)

okay cool so i'll pile through this and then hand it over to phil so for those who are new here at the stoah stoah sort of like a [[sensemaking]] hub or node here on the little part of the internet in the noosphere and the idea is to escape all the culture were noise and invite all these magnetic tribes in so they can start talking to each other jamming with each other and sense-making with each [94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=94.73s)

other and the ultimate goal is to kind of make nomadic tribes become embody tribes and we have a few sort of themes here at the stone we have a wisdom jim forming with such events like a relational exegesis collected presencing socratic speed-dating and made in mind metagame mastermind father for the moment serves as a psychotechnology incubator where people can kind of test [116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=116.69s)

transformational experiences as a stone and if it works that it could be poured into a wisdom gym and we have sense-making sessions like like we have today or we have someone who puts themselves out there actually they're thinking and they share their thoughts with the group today we have a [[sensemaking]] amends himself daniel schmock tim berger and i imagine [136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=136.519s)

everyone here is those of them to some extent that being said we have also have our emcee of the evening phil chen phil's a good friend of mine here in toronto and he's a be a superstar in the game be space so i'm gonna hand over to phil right now and he's going to introduce daniel and then tell us how we're going to proceed today i'm just gonna get and commune now [157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=157.73s)

hopefully people can hear me i'm a little nervous i'm opening the internet can awesome guys can hear me great yeah hopefully the internet can hold up here we don't have like wait - terry's home and i feel my heart rate beating a lot faster oh yeah i'm excited really excited facilitate a session with banish mocking burger today i first heard him about him [185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=185.9s)

probably more than a year ago and it changed my life it's one of the leading sense makers and just overall a beautiful wonderful human being so he's here to talk to us about what the session he called converting moloch from the syph to jedi and i'll let him explain more but i think it's gonna be super interesting afterwards we're gonna have a q&a or he'll be answering some of [215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=215.48s)

your questions so how that will work is if you have a question please write it in the chat and then i'll call upon you to unmute and ask your questions now this whole session is going to be recorded so if you want me to read your question please indicate it and write it down so yeah i think that's a the intro and i just wanted to pass to daniel to kick us off let me figure out how okay [244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=244.76s)

you know hear me and is the audio working yeah alright i'm not sure if y'all can hear me the others working where there's a legging yes thumbs up alright anything i should do about that i am seeing lag time and response also should should i go or wait for it to calibrate alright thank you peter phil for having me nice to see everybody here this is i have been [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=296.92s)

adjacent to seeing the stoic emerge obviously lots of people i respect been on here this is my first one to actually get to participate in myself my understanding is that it's not sharing things that we have kind of have a decent sense of having figured out but things that were kind of on the edge of figuring out ourselves and so peter you had asked me what is a topic i'm kind of [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=323.169s)

interested in and contemplating at the moment i think you phrased it as the road to a damon but so yeah that's where the converting moloch from sif to jedi was the first thought that came up or i think i also said something like how to close evolutionary niches for sociopathy and predatory predatory expressions of sociopathy this is definitely a primary topic on my mind right now [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=352.24s)

i i'm not sure if everybody on here is familiar with the term moloch used in the way that like it was defined in meditations on moloch from slate start codex i've talked about it that way other times if not all do a basic definition anyone not familiar with it okay before i just kind of dive in peter fill any thing else for context not on my end what do you think phil [387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=387.7s)

yeah not am i and i think the good to define moloch so moloch is a if you haven't read it yet google meditations on moloch slates are codex it's a brilliant beautiful article it's describing [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] but in a way that gives both good grounded examples and nice poetry to it and [[multipolar trap]] basically is a game theoretic situation where you have a number of players where if any of them defects it creates an incentive for everybody else to defect defect on some type of agreement that would actually create a better global optimum for the whole but each person's own local optimum would have them defect on the whole but then you get a [[race to the bottom]] and in other words if anyone does something that is kind of really bad for the commons and bad for the whole long-term but provides a lot of near-term advantage for them they just win so everyone else then to not lose has to race to do that thing faster and an [[arms race]] is a classic example so if anybody builds the new type of weapon and anyone else says no that weapons  __  we shouldn't have chemical [463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=463.06s)

weapons or biological weapons or ai automated killing weapons and whoever builds them just wins everything runs the world so anybody builds a fucked-up weapon and now everybody has to race to build that weapon plus counter weapons plus better versions of that weapon faster so that's a kind of [[arms race]] example tragedy of the commons is another kind of classic example anybody [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=485.47s)

does something that externalizes more of the cost to the commons they figure out some mining method that maybe leaves a lot more tailings or mountaintop removal or whatever but it increases margins and opens up new markets whoever does that will economically beat out the ones who aren't doing it so then everybody races to do the more extractive polluting externalizing thing and you're left with [505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=505.63s)

no forests and no fish and toxic tailings in the water and that kind of thing so a [[race to the bottom]] there's a simple way of thinking about it so a lot of people when they think about what's underneath all the problems in the they start to think about social architectures and so one of the social architectures is this kind of game theoretic [[race to the bottom]] type scenario where a very small number of sociopaths or sadists or  __  can create a game dynamic that then everyone else has obligated to not just play but try to play to win and we see this actually playing out right like the un was created out of world war two to try and prevent nuclear proliferation and then has had the primary goal of nuclear deep proliferation and we have way more [557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=557.92s)

countries with way faster nukes now than we did then it's like why have we failed so profoundly at being able to get rid of nukes because who wants to give up their last nuke first like no nobody's stupid and and how do we know if the other guys actually gave up their last nuke or if they're saying they gave up their last nuke and they're just hiding one and so it becomes very hard to share [578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=578.89s)

the optics necessary to get the kind of agreement so if we don't give up all the nukes then we actually say ok we  __  it we've got nukes i can actually win [[mutually assured destruction]] if my nukes are way faster and i can win first strike so the entire cold war was a race between soviet and us military manufactured for hypersonic missiles to see can we make faster and faster nukes [603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=603.1s)

and right now the main one is there's massive [[arms race|arms races]] and cyber weaponry there's massive [[arms race|arms races]] in obviously bio but ai is the really big one autonomous weapons so how do we get out of that is a big question and and we can see a bunch of examples when we talk about tragedy of the commons it's not just environmental commons it's also epistemic and emotional common some news [633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=633.06s)

agency figures out how to use more inflammatory salacious headlines that hijack your limbic [[nervous system]] better and more people just open that  __  because it actually worked and you're like i want to know you know trump eviscerate somebody or whatever like the words that that hit some evolutionary trigger and then everyone is racing to have the most salacious [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=655.76s)

headlines and compress the complexity into the shortest number of bullet points and whatever and then it's not just a race for who has the most headlines it will create a clique but who has the delivery platforms that can micro targets the most addictive ones to you personally right so then this is what facebook and google and twitter and the large platforms in competition with [682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=682.19s)

each other are doing is actually competing for time on site and attention across the scope of everybody's attention better and i'm sure everybody in here knows that if you aren't familiar with work like the work of tristan harris you should definitely become familiar with it but if you look at your facebook feed it's nothing at all like the facebook feed of someone [704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=704.81s)

with slightly different views and aesthetics and preferences because the total number of things that you can see in your facebook feed represents a trillionth of a percent of all the  __  on facebook so how is it determining what goes in your feet well it's determining it based on the stuff that will make you stay on the site longest not just based on what you actually hit [724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=724.01s)

like but how long your mouse hovers and how long your eye hovers and whatever over all kinds of things and so one of the quotes that one of the ideas that tristan particularly likes and i think it's a very important one is that the kinds of ais that optimize your newsfeed or higher power ai is in the ais that beat kasparov at chess and to just get a sense of how much  __  better [753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=753.89s)

kasparov is at chest and you aren't controlling your own attention and when he knows that he's playing right and beat him just so clearly and easily you have ai is better than that beating you at the allocation of your own attention and you don't even realize you're engaged in such a warfare and it's getting to use fear and tribalism and sex and money and desire and food and [773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=773.84s)

every  __  [[hypernormal stimuli]] possible and so it optimizes you know newsfeed for those things so the information ecology gets destroyed in the environments so we can say not the google issue or the ai weapons issue or the if they're gonna cut the trees down there won't be trees anyways even if i don't cut them down but they'll just [796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=796.74s)

have all the economics and they'll use that to attack us so i got actually raised to cut the elm trees faster we see this happening in the amazon right now amazon touches nine countries and if any of the countries let enough destruction of the amazon happen it can actually be catalytic to kill the amazon right brazil could do it ecuador could do it so no country actually has the [816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=816.27s)

sovereign ability to protect the amazon they have the ability to protect a little local region and then the multinationals that want to do the mining and the extraction say okay if you don't let us come there we'll just put all of that money into the surrounding countries your people will protest and kick you out because of that because they aren't giving any of the [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=836.67s)

economic stimulus the amazon is still  __  so what's interesting is you have a situation where the president of or the government of each of those countries doesn't have the authority to protect the amazon but they do have the authority to advance being cut down and advance those kind of game theoretic arrangements so that's why the amazon is a hard issue so if we take all these [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=856.59s)

issues nuclear disarmament and ai disarmament and tragedy of the commons writ large and we say underneath all of those is a what you could call gradient descent right someone does something that figures out how to extract something more extract your attention extract a resource from the environment while externalizing or directly causing some harm more effectively and so [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=879.69s)

there's an increased competitive margin in an assumed competitive or force competitive game so then the iteration keeps being a slightly more  __  up and more near-term effective long term destructive things so the nexus tential risk is inexorable so that's what we'd call the [[race to the bottom]] so we would call gradient descent and you can call it a [[paperclip maximizer]] if you want to look at boström sperms the idea if if people aren't familiar i'll do a very short version of this in the book super intelligence where nick bostrom laid out ai risk there's like not one ai risk scenario there's a million ai risk scenarios because it's not just things look like terminator it's also things that look like google that lead to increasing or in conflict because of [934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=934.81s)

polarization because of news feeds and tribalism which is stuff like peter talks about these mimetic tribes actually are getting more distinct and more separate partly because of platform dynamics so with the [[paperclip maximizer]] bostrom laid out one very simple scenario where you could have an ai that kills everything and basically the gist is you [960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=960.54s)

have this ai that like being able getting trained on chess to beat kasparov they're being trained on go to be the best go player it's trained on optimizing a [[supply chain]] and that's like the actual useful  __  we want to do with a eyes right we want to make them more efficient and be able to do  __  like optimize supply agents so we make a ai that has sensor [978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=978.9s)

input all along the [[supply chain]] and say make more paper clips and or widgets of whatever kind cars whatever but paper clip in the analogy so it starts figuring out how to decrease in efficiencies and how to turn the lights off because it's kidding it doesn't need humans in the space while it's running and the electricity costs go back to substrate and whatever and it's that [1008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1008.42s)

actually seems like an environmentally good thing because it's more efficient but as you fast-forward the scenario if it has an optimization function for a narrow metric like more paper clips then there'll be a point at which it is made all the paper clips it can with its existing substrate and now it has to get more substrate so now it has to make new mines to get more metal to make it and [1028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1028.82s)

then it has to actually compete with the people that want to use that for other materials but it can out-compete them and on and on until eventually it turns the whole world into paper clips because if it can and all the paper clip maximizer needs to do this is the ability to optimize some function and to get better to get more intelligent at its ability to do that so recursive [1050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1050.0s)

intelligence and an optimization function can kill everything so long as its ability to get better at it is faster than our ability if we didn't like what it was doing to beat it right so one can say that capitalism writ large is a paper clip maximizer and capitalism is obviously inanimate but this ai might be inanimate right the ai is an algorithm it's not a [1078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1078.77s)

consciousness but it is an optimization function with the ability to get better and and recursive veterans that meaning exponentially better well if you think about capitalism i i'm hearing comments not too much time on all this all right well we're almost framed up with what moloch is so capitalism is the process of being able to take a single metric [1107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1107.809s)

which is a dollar or a piece of fiat currency of whatever kind or currency of some kind and be able to incent some kinds of production of goods and services and but of course as soon as you understand that the interest on the monetary supply requires an [[exponential growth]] of the monetary supply and to not debase the monetary supply requires an [[exponential growth]] in goods and services which requires increase in extraction and all those things you start to realize that capitalism as a whole is incenting an increased movement of turning everything into things that are measurable by dollars value that is metrical by dollars because let's say there's a kind of value like i appreciate the feeling of sunshine or i appreciate the sound of songbirds but [1162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1162.559s)

there is i'm not willing to pay for that in market value then what happens is but i am willing to pay for something in market value that pollutes the air that makes the sunshine less or kills the songbirds the value that is measurable extractable and exchangeable ends up conferring power in a way the things that we value that are not measurable extractable and exchangeable don't and [1183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1183.35s)

so all types of value get oriented towards the ones that confer power so that's a paper clip maximizer so we can and when you talk about getting recursively better you have a movement from barter to some type of currency to a fiat currency to fractional reserve on fiat currency to complex financial instruments is actually the ai getting better and better at being able to [1206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1206.84s)

incent the conversion of more things to metric level value derivatives are converting complex future optionality ideas into measurable dollar value today so we can say the [[paperclip maximizer]] is moloch and it's all this kind of gradient descent and capitalism is just one instantiation communism and other things actually we're all so different and sensations of the [[paperclip maximizer]] as was their competition with each other and so the gist as you can say unbounded rival risk [[game theory]] as a whole is the essence of more walk right moloch is the [[emergent property]] of unbounded of basically [[game theory]] by creatures that have the ability to exponentiate their capacity to do so which through the ability to do tool creation and buy tools i mean physical [1256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1256.409s)

tools and social tools so i could say that everything that i'm focused on is is how to kill moloch which is the [[generator function]] of all those other things but you don't actually have to kill it right so this was this topic of being able to convert moloch from the dark side to the light side which is can you actually it's a funny concept that if you if you read what aleister crowley [1285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1285.629s)

got obsessed with for a while and has a study of the occult many occult traditions have this idea that one of the highest things you can do is summon a demon and convert it to an angel and we see mythos everywhere about like darth vader be you know doing the good act right at the very end so that's why i just i was thinking about is kind of a fun idea if we just just say that moloch [1307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1307.71s)

in essence is [[game theory]] it is some agents it's different agents that can optimize their own well-being differentially to each other where any innovation that any of them do leads to the other ones needing to innovate in a relevant or commensurate direction that doesn't have to only be gradient descent it can also be gradient ascend you can engineer races to the top where someone [1346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1346.71s)

conduced something that is actually better for the long term and that actually creates near-term adaptive advantage they creates an incentive for other people organizations companies to do things that are also following that similar trend so the question of how do you make things and so what one way we can think about morlock also is the kind of [1375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1375.15s)

near-term short-term schism of that what is good for the long term we can't actually do because we'll lose in the short and medium term if we do it because we don't have enough resource and that there are things that provide near-term benefit and this is like okay so i cut down the tree i get immediate material advantage from doing so if i don't cut down the tree yes there are [1396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1396.57s)

forests for great-grandchildren but that doesn't increase my power to do or affect anything and thinking about it as an individual me cutting down the tree doesn't affect trees writ large all that much but everybody doing it and then racing to do it faster actually really does so the question becomes how do we identify directions that are better for the whole [1419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1419.43s)

long term that are actually viable in the near term in the presence of rival risk competition still happening or embedded within that context now we can start to get into a bunch of examples of how that can happen but that's kind of angry cool so we'll put it to the qa filled you want to frame that for us yeah sure um so thank you daniel for that [1452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1452.65s)

introduction so now we're gonna pivot to a q&a section how i work is please write down your questions in the chat box and i will call upon you to a mute and ask your questions if and just a reminder this is being recorded so if you don't want your question to be for you to say the questions i can read that on your behalf so to get things started off i'm gonna first ask a few questions as we [1496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1496.79s)

hope to collect that [[collective intelligence]] here in the crowd so for daniel what would you say is one example that you're seeing today around upwards gradient up ascent or what are the like the seeds that you're seeing happening in the world in this direction there's some classic ones musk in electric cars is a very classic one and it's actually very interesting to see why that's the [1544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1544.7s)

case related to the short term medium term long term thing which is because of the paypal exit he was he didn't have to be beholden to venture capital or put a little bit of money that created immediate roi on money so he could do some extended r&d it wouldn't have been able to happen otherwise that was actually the key thing was that he was able to not have [1576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1576.159s)

to use his immediate resources to just keep getting immediate resources which is the hamster wheel he had enough resource that he was able to do r&d to create a new spot on the map and the idea of full-stack integration of can we really make a more efficient battery and a more you know efficient electric car as a whole and then once he does that it becomes obvious that it's both a doable [1598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1598.539s)

and a desirable thing and then all the other car manufacturers realize they become obsolete unless they also do it and now you have everybody racing to do electric cars better in a way that they really weren't before right so that's the kind of a and that doesn't mean that electric cars don't have lots of problems with the material acquisition of the base metals needed to make the [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1618.01s)

batteries and a bunch of other  __  but it's a good example of a a new race that is happening that is at least directionally right in some critical ways that wasn't i would even say that like the long form intellectual podcasting thing of which this is a derivative that let's say tim ferriss and joe rogan kind of pioneered which was almost an a counter movement to [1645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1645.01s)

sound bites and tweets and kind of entertainment only which is let's do long-form conversation let's do low production value but higher authenticity and let's actually explore some topics and depth started becoming a desirable enough thing that a lot of people did that now you've got eric weinstein interviewing roger penrose about exotic physics and people are actually watching [1671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1671.62s)

and that was just not a thing a little while ago right so that's a cool example i'm mostly interested in examples that could be created that are not currently created for some the worst problems where we can actually change topologies of markets to solve very large-scale problems where the topology of markets are currently and causing the problems [1697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1697.64s)

which means being able to change the incentive landscape so when you think about the way that soros shorted the pound he actually changed the incentive of an entire hmm and he changed the topology of an incentive landscape because pounds were worth less relative to other forms of currency after he did that well that required him having a certain kind of intel he had to know [1721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1721.669s)

that there was a sustainably inflated pound valuation and that it wasn't self-correcting and then he had to have enough money he had to be a whale right enough money under management at least they by shorting it hard enough he didn't just lose all his money he actually signaled something that made the marquetry correct which meant he had devin both had enough [[sensemaking]] and enough actuation capacity and the [[sensemaking]] could see the opportunity to correct something in actuation capacity could act on it well there's plenty of places where there are things that are bad for the world environmentally or whatever that are only barely profitable but at scale still profitable and we could make them more expensive through a number of means and there are things [1758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1758.27s)

that are not quite profitable and this is kind of what elon showed but if you could get economy of scale over a certain threshold or you change the narrative landscape to increase demand for in particular ways or you change legislation in certain ways you can make those things more profitable this is like not a new idea but the idea of being able to use the [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1778.01s)

right kind of [[sensemaking]] so intelligence combined with the right kind of high scale financial capacities most of the time the groups that are focused on let's benefit the environment don't create massive private equity funds and hedge funds and dark pools to say how do we change the topology of finance writ large and so the idea of being able and the people that do that [1802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1802.429s)

do it for almost exclusively personal gain extractive traditional moloc purposes but those moloc tools that can change the topology of markets in a way that then moves what everyone else is incentive to do can also be used to create races to the top where they aren't currently being implemented so i can give you an example when it comes to the amazon if you want but i [1824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1824.78s)

don't know if there are other questions first huh i would love to actually hear about the amazon the one or maybe later if if people feel called i am really enjoying the fact that a lot of [[collective intelligence]] happening in the chat so if people want to hear that and it's not just my own personal interest in the amazon then people can share that in the chat i do want to let people know [1860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1860.24s)

that we have daniel here until 8:30 in case people were wondering this is whether this was in power long i guess a session so just to get people some time heads up and i'm really appreciating all the plus ones so it helps me choose i'll see what people are really interested in so i think the first question that i want to cut to the group will want to call on would be from daniel kazanjian [1888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1888.59s)

hey i thinks daniel i just have a question for grounding this discussion in a more personal way like i love hearing about how we can resolve things at a systemic level and obviously that discussion needs to be had but one takeaway that i hope to take is how i can take what you're saying and some of the thinking around the space and actually improve my relationships [1915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1915.26s)

improves what's immediately at hand so do you have any personal ideas or examples for how this idea of moloch alchemy can apply really really locally like within your friendships or within your your marriages and family that kind of thing yes and no yes it can apply and you actually don't want your friendships and marriages to have [[game theory]] as their primary driver no matter what even a race to the top i don't want to be trying to out-compete my wife or who's nicer to each other like that's just the wrong  __  headframe so what i'm talking about with converting moloch is insofar as there are competitive relationships there are relationships that have real kind of agency competition going on can we make [1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1969.72s)

races to the top but that doesn't mean that all action is [[game theory]] mediated the so when i'm talking about converting moloch that's actually not a [[game b]] idea it's a game a to game be transitional idea right [[game b]] idea is that anti rivalries relationships in which moloch is not actually a thing the underlying kind of [[game theory]] so now if we say in your in your local environment are there [1998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=1998.47s)

plenty of rivalries relationships that can move in the right direction yeah like having a subculture define cool differently in a way that creates a gradient ascent is actually a really  __  valuable thing to do and and you know and this is like basic  __  but very basic principles around virtue of if there's a guy who's doing something kind of better than you and some other [2029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2029.19s)

friends and chicks and whatever are noticing it and you feel some competitive impulse don't try to bring him down ever just try to get better yourself like take it at take it as a impulse of the right kind of competition to be like oh i'm only feeling that because and you can take this two different ways i'm only saying this because of some wounded childhood [2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2049.679s)

insecurities let's just heal that that's also important and then so and sometimes because there's something i actually respect there and it's an in it's actually a cue for me to notice that there's an area that i value desire and respect that i feel like i could step into more so that's an example of like positive competition or positive moloch type [2071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2071.909s)

dynamics if you think about the basis of rivalry from an evolutionary bio perspective it's it's survival selection and mate selection right like primarily those things so it's it's getting stuff and it's getting mates like that were the deepest evolutionary signal is mostly those things and so obviously getting stuff is the one that has this pretty one that has this particularly [2102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2102.45s)

unbounded characteristic in a situation where you have you're not just doing survival stuff but you can amass billions of dollars so we're talking about that but as far as mate selection goes you've probably all heard various people talk about i think brett weinstein has probably talked about it publicly the most in a way that's adjacent to this group of if women [2128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2128.01s)

redefined what was sexy whatever the answer of what they defined was is what all guys would do because if there was a this is actually kind of interesting i'll digress for a moment one of critique that brett gave me years ago when we met of the sexual liberation movement i thought was actually quite insightful and it was one i hadn't thought of before that was with birth [2161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2161.069s)

control we decoupled sex from procreation there's a lot that was awesome about that and i don't think anybody wants to go back to a pre birth control world but there was also some major downsides which was it's much less costly evolutionarily for a man to have sex then for a woman to have sex because he possibly can have this toxic mating strategy of spread your seed and bail [2187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2187.289s)

and she can't write like that's something she just physiologically can't do so she obviously has an evolutionary impetus to ensure a kind of bonding that can raise that child because our extended helpless neoteny and extended gestation period make it charter on humans to raise babies than other species and that when we decoupled those when they were coupled now this is [2214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2214.799s)

not exactly true and if we go back and look at some cultures that had polyandry versus polygamy versus multi-male multi-female systems versus a hundred different social implementations of monogamy so they'll all be different so i'm just gonna say a very generalized trend as a starting place here in a enforcement agha me through social shaming culture like much of the kind of [2240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2240.089s)

western civilization in the victorian age on has been at least if a woman didn't want to raise kids with a guy she also didn't wanna have sex with him because especially pre birth control she couldn't guarantee that having sex with a guy didn't result in having a baby so he had to actually be good father material to get laid now good father material corresponds to good citizen [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2272.67s)

much much more than just good lay correspondence a good citizen cuz the guy can be a good lamb be an utter  __  but he can't actually be a good father and be an utter  __  good father means that he can provide and he can be tempered and he can stay in something for a long time and he can prioritize somebody other than himself and you know father and family person [2292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2292.079s)

and so there was something around so this is then where the slut-shaming thing becomes a big deal or horse shaming and like let's make sure that no women ever  __  men outside of marriage because we don't want to create an evolutionary niche for guys who are  __  to get laid if a guy's an  __  we want to if the guy wouldn't be a good father we want him to never be [2316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2316.799s)

liable so that all the men have a race to become the guy that would be a better father so women's freedom of selection is actually selecting for something that is good for the society right that's a very interesting kind of thing so there were actually some people who predicted that following the sexual liberation movement we get something like the pickup artists [2338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2338.309s)

movement which is a evolutionary niche that grows for guys who are  __  who can get laid so now is this woman's responsibility to say no there's also a [[multipolar trap]] because a particular woman say okay i'm not going to  __  the guy who seems like a attractive bad boy whatever but wouldn't be a good father but other women still will so i didn't close the niche this is why it was not [2366](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2366.18s)

only their own behavior but the women enforcing other women type social policy there's a lot that's tricky in here i'm not going to suggest some kind of like traditionalist regressive move but i'm gonna say that the progress have moved missed a few things and so there's a deeper kind of analysis has to happen so could women start reshaping using knowing that men will become that which [2390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2390.029s)

they think will get them the best mating selection whether they know it or not could women help to reshape the topology of that incentive landscape yeah of course could men also help to reshape it yes they also could so i want to say there's responsibility for this on both parts could guys that because a lot of guys might hear this as okay some beta that [2416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2416.91s)

has an issue with violence is going to try to convince women to be attracted to something they aren't attracted to so that he can get laid right like that would be the argument so if men started developing what would make them attractive to women for evolutionary biology purposes and what would make them a good citizen virtuously simultaneously so they were actually [2449](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2449.959s)

creating an incentive for women to start to notice that new race to the top scenario you could have a recursion there this is obviously a total tangent from the question you asked me but it's an interesting one okay actually i did actually yeah i'm curious if this is what you were getting at on the weinstein podcast you mean when i avoided his questions about sex [2482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2482.22s)

selection yes no i just didn't want to talk about that topic there because it's a big ass very varied audience and i didn't think the answers were within the zone of proximal development of the audience as its as a side question this is a central and also thorny issue for sure um i just want to let people know that if your question was like really early on i am having a tough time [2513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2513.69s)

scrolling up so if you want to ask your question again or is more relevant now please do so and i do appreciate all the plus ones i personally want to go back to the amazon example and i noticed something that you've been thinking a lot of bed and we've had some discussions on so left to hear what your thoughts are on that so we'll kind of use the frame of using [2542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2542.96s)

the masters tools to dismantle the house or you know something to that effect a key characteristic of moloch that is actually deeper than the traditional assessments you usually get to like the slates are codecs one doesn't quite get here is that power seeking psychologies that don't have psychology that restrains the use and abuse of power get more power and so psychologies that are [2589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2589.47s)

both oriented to do everything they can to get and utilize power and don't restrain themselves in their use of it for for reasons like ethics will end up getting more power and ones who are either less oriented towards it or don't want to use it harmfully create bases to have less of it so the world ends up being run by sociopaths and that's like a very deep underlying thing to address [2618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2618.45s)

it can be a relatively small percentage of the total population but it's important to understand that power itself follows a power law distribution it wouldn't in a tribe where everyone is roughly symmetrical and strength the toughest guy isn't tougher than three average guys right but the richest guy today is richer than three average guys he he might be richer than three million [2646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2646.94s)

average guys together and if he has access to nukes he might be more powerful than 3 billion average guys together it's like what the  __  that's so many orders of magnitude of asymmetry so our you know technology and capital have created thousands millions billions of times a cemetry in power and that's not an evolutionary thing which means it it actually broke evolution in the way [2674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2674.579s)

that we think of it evolution depends upon cemetery's of power i won't get into vexed i've talked about that other places but when you have a power-law distribution like this of say wealth there's there's like only a few people in groups that have a trillion dollars and then there's a slightly larger group that have a hundred billion but still [2696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2696.729s)

very very small and then you realize that there's a tiny number of people that have more ability to influence the whole than whole other populations combined and the same is true with access to military power so then you say what does it take to get to the top of a power-law distribution of power or what what does it take behaviorally and then what does it take psychologically to [2723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2723.67s)

just to create the disposition for those behaviors and to be successful at it if i have a bunch of money i don't it's very hard for me to know why someone claims to like me right or why do they want to be my friend or why they want to be in a relationship especially if people know that i have a lot of money it's very hard for me to have a sense of trust an authentic relationship this is [2748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2748.45s)

a psychological harm almost every wealthy person i know has in common there's a bunch of reasons why it really sucks to have more power it also means that i'm gonna be forced to engage in some of these rivalries things where it's like doesn't matter democrat or republican all the presidents of the u.s. in recent history have used the us military to kill civilians that's a big [2772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2772.569s)

 __  deal most people on here would not want to authorize a drone strike that was going to kill civilians so engaging in the game of power becomes obligate if you get near the top of the power stack so typically cluster b-type disorders that are both oriented towards wanting power and that are less restrained in their use of it will do better at getting it and groups that [2807](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2807.43s)

either are more considerate of the whole and don't want to externalize and cause harm are gonna get less power which means less influence over the system as a whole which the whole system will have this gradient towards sociopathy now this all of the conversations around theodicy and the nature of evil and power and whatever like come up here why did i bring that [2828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2828.43s)

up because yes about the amazon okay if you start to understand why the amazon is an issue you'll realize that the people that are making the decisions to do the turn the rainforest into grazing land for cattle for mcdonald's or to take the base metals of the precious metals or to run trafficking of arms and people and drugs through it or oil or whatever it is i'll share this [2860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2860.92s)

motivational landscape the the corporations have a financial interest the and it's important to understand even here that the relationship of limited liability of a corporation orient's it towards sociopathy because the corporation can make money pay people out that money those people are really because the corporation isn't an entity it's a fictitious it's not a real [2898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2898.09s)

agent or real entity the people who get paid out the corporation is going to protect so the corporation can bankrupt and those people can do a new thing but the corporation can't go to jail it can only get fined so it doesn't have comparable downsides relative to its upsides and it's not subject to law because if a corporation breaks a law you can't put it in jail and you can do [2919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2919.63s)

is find it and if the fine costs less than the money made by violating the law you just violate the law and pay the cost of the fine or if the fine starts getting too expensive you pay the lobbying to change the laws that quote that dumb criminals break laws and smart criminals make laws it is kind of an important insight so the corporations have those incentives [2949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2949.2s)

the people within the corporations and the nation-states behind the corporations have the incentives they have so you know we have european chinese and north american companies mostly going to the amazon they have national [[national security]] interests behind them the chinese multinational companies also have ccp interests to have hundred-year food security and [2972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2972.94s)

hundred-year resource security and koerner certain markets and have positions in the americas relative to the us so they have very serious high-level interests that are not to the protection of the amazon right now the government has to still okay certain things but the government is also a non agent run by people and so the particular person that got to be the [2997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=2997.42s)

head of the interior or the president isn't gonna be in that position for all that long but he's gonna keep being a person in having a family and having a legacy for a long time so if he tries to do the thing that protects the amazon four years later when he's out someone else will  __  the amazon so it seems inexorable but if he goes ahead and lets it happen he gets a bank [3018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3018.42s)

account in switzerland or let kim stein filled up with a bunch of money for him and his family so you can see how there's a confluence of [[perverse incentive]] and asymmetry between the upside and downside kind of everywhere but it's important to understand that the psychologies that are in play in making those decisions are not the ones that they express to be right in the [3042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3042.18s)

news everyone's expressing certain considerations because those are not the actual ones at play and but now what types of tools do they use to be effective well you have financial institutions that have trillions of dollars or at least tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in assets under management that can financially manipulate a sovereign government by [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3067.079s)

being able to pay off enough of the corrupt politicians being able to incentivize the government as a whole to basically co-opt its sovereign law greenpeace doesn't do that like the nonprofit's that are trying to protect the amazon for the most part they aren't even trying to protect the amazon the young activists in them are but the top of the ngos the ngos end up [3089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3089.14s)

getting a lot of power some of the ngos and this is actually an important thing to understand that i learned very much the hard way coming up in this space is if there's a problem and you incentivize what you make a company or an organization or a non-profit or a government agency to solve that problem and now the there are people who have salaries forever and they didn't have [3114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3114.25s)

salaries before and they have access to power and prestige if you really solve that problem that whole thing would go out of business and all those people to lose all that stuff that was beneficial to them so they have an ongoing incentive to maintain the problem and maintain the legitimacy of them as a response to managing it so the incentives skewed towards managing [3131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3131.11s)

problems forever rather than really solving or obsoleting them so you have to really pay attention to the incentive architectures underneath all of those things usually i can look at someone has a plan for how to fix the amazon or the grid or nuclear disarmament i just have to look at the incentive landscape of the institutions and people that are involved and will usually have a pretty [3151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3151.66s)

quick sense of where it fails so as a transition from game a to [[game b]] where we are in the presence of ubiquitous rivalry that is both empowered with very high level national and private intelligence and the top level financial capabilities and private militias and all that  __  we don't get to gain b if we lose comprehensively in the game anything right now so this is this [3185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3185.11s)

question we've asked before of if the peaceful cultures always get killed by the warring cultures and if they don't get killed at the warring cultures because they get better at war which makes them no longer peaceful cultures that's another way to describe moloc how do you have peaceful cultures that don't get killed by the warring cultures or get converted into them is another key [3206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3206.74s)

way to kind of think about this and another way to think about it is what is legitimate power versus illegitimate power and one way of defining that one way i define it is so let's say we have a power law distribution of power if i start to gain more power in that so i have 10x the money of average people or 100x or whatever it is or visibility or something i'm benefiting from that i can [3239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3239.56s)

pay gardeners and maids and people to come do  __  for me at less than i make per hour like i'm really benefiting from that power asymmetry and if those people who charge that rate charge the same thing i charge i wouldn't be able to do it so i'm maximally incentive to maintain that power asymmetry and grow it so it goes from maids and gardeners to yacht [3263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3263.26s)

repairers and whatever else right and so typically if anyone has an asymmetry of power they have both an incentive and the capability to grow they're a cemetry of power they have the capability because they have more power right and they have the incentive so i would say illage illegitimate power is doing that is utilizing [[asymmetric power]] to maintain and grow the asymmetry of power [3288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3288.16s)

which then has other groups that are most everyone else isn't capable so you have the separation of the haves and the have-nots and the haves or the other ones who have power written the [[arms race|arms races]] with each other and competitions for controlling the minds of everyone else so they vote in purchase in the right direction what i would call legitimate power or power in a [[game b]] direction is if i have an asymmetry of power i want to use it to uplift everyone else to have more power and to utilize it better to increase the legitimate power access of everyone else and which is basically what teacherly authority is right teacher is saying okay i have knowledge that they don't have but i'm not trying to maintain the knowledge over my student forever i [3334](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3334.33s)

actually want my student to surpass me so how do i use this increased capacity in a div that intentionally developmental way now what i want is people who have that orientation actually get good at power actually develop [[asymmetric power]] so it's not only that the cia and the ccp and the kremlin and dark pool organizations that have it in black [3359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3359.89s)

water but it's groups that are authentically oriented in the legitimate use of power who are developing it and then utilizing it for those purposes and that power both means that they can adequately defend themselves against the attacks while helping to move things in a different direction so if i look at what are the capacities and what are the tools that say multinationals will use [3381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3381.499s)

to influence sovereign governments to take their mineral rights and whatever they'll come give them a big ass loan that they know they can never pay back that's collateralized with the asset rights of the infrastructure of the country right the world bank has done that forever trying to learn from watching the world bank they're doing it better than we are but it's the same [3403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3403.009s)

 __  so and they another example of a tool they'll use so that's called predatory lending another example will be bundling and we see our politicians do this all the time here's proposition a makes clean water for everybody and without it we're flint michigan and whatever and everybody's gonna  __  die from hexa chromate okay everybody wants proposition a but in the fine [3425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3425.93s)

print it also includes taking away some civil liberty that has nothing  __  to do with clean water like what the  __  we do surveillance tech is implanted everywhere how does that have anything to do with it well because the the person who wanted that figured out how to bundle it where you have to go for it so bundling is a game a tool that is mostly used for evil but it could be [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3444.92s)

used for good right just like the right types of lending and indebted mit could be so let's say let me give the example of ecuador in the amazon now i was building rectangles yes great i was just gonna jump in and ask you how you connect it back and specifically what i could our example so the since i've got nine different countries i've got to deal with and the amazon as a whole [3471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3471.829s)

doesn't have sovereign law there isn't an ig oh that has any meaningful power to be able to bind predatory capitalism so i have to work at the level of the individual countries but we already said that if a particular country says we're not gonna let rainforest extraction happen they do so much economically less well than the other countries that they get so much pushback so how do we create [3491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3491.33s)

a situation where a single country can actually do economically better and better in terms of their economics their publicity their [[national security]] by doing something that's also environmentally more friendly so we create a race to the top rather than the [[race to the bottom]] can we engineer such a scenario the answer ends up being yes and this is one of the things i'm [3510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3510.59s)

particularly interested in right now so let's say we take ecuador as an example because it's the headwater of the amazon right brazil is the largest total body of amazon peru has some of the most biodiversity but the headwater of the amazon is the most sensitive area and it happens to be highly at risk right now so ecuador owes 14 billion dollars to the world bank and 20 billion dollars to [3539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3539.54s)

china that it doesn't have any economic capability to be able to pay off so those are loans that are going to default at some point they are collateralized with the asset rights at the headwaters of the amazon what do we do with that headwaters the amazon goes the entire amazon goes well what most ngos do is they just put picket signs by the bulldozers and tried to like hold [3568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3568.07s)

the frontline and maybe empower the indigenous people with some resistance of the frontline which doesn't  __  work at all right because this way you have an indigenous person an indigenous leader getting killed pretty much every day in the amazon and they don't mind hiring private militias behind [[plausible deniability]] that they didn't do it like that is par for the course all the time [3589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3589.76s)

now slightly craftier activists will say okay what we're gonna do is rile the people up to really care well the people are poor they want economic opportunities it seems like there's an endless amount of amazon and it's all benefiting a few indigenous people and not them and and they the nonprofit's don't control the media as effectively as the for-profits do which is what's [3617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3617.63s)

telling everyone else hey they're trying to keep us from our own national assets and keep you poor okay so how do you actually win at the narrative game and then maybe even craftier ones will say okay really we have to deal with economic so we're gonna bring in economics alternative to extractive rainforests stuff we're gonna say hey look we're gonna bring a silicon valley [3639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3639.319s)

tech sector to quito so that you can start making a lot of money with tech so you don't have to do the rainforest stuff and they say awesome do that we don't think it'll work if it does work awesome and we're still doing the amazon sales because that's money today and we know how to do that so you don't just have to bring an alternative you have to bind the predatory capitalism not just [3659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3659.9s)

bring an alternative better capitalism you have to bind the other one because if you don't bind the other one both running side by side the other one still kills everything all right well how do you do that so an example in ecuador could look like this and i'm giving it at a very high topological level but you can just see the types of thinking they're just like [[climate change]] has a runaway positive feedback loop where at a certain point and [[climate change]] the heating makes it easier to heat faster rainforest destruction has a runaway feedback loop because you have this thing called the hydrological pump or waters evaporating through the trees which makes moisture which creates it being a rainforest which keeps pumping water because you have a lot of rain now [3705](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3705.049s)

what happens with that hydrological pump is some of the water falls back over the amazon and some of it goes into the atmosphere and goes to some convection current and that's actually where 30 to 50 percent yearly if north america's rainfall comes from its transpiration from the amazon now you start to lose enough forest cover where you get less rain and then you get less transpiration [3723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3723.079s)

which gets drier which makes it easier for the to lose more forest cover and fires and like that and you get a kind of runaway dynamic so that's called breaking the hydrological pump so how far are we with rainforest cover destruction in the amazon before we get that positive feedback loop we don't know different scientists hydrologist things somewhere between next year and [3744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3744.89s)

15 years from now but both of those are really  __  soon and really soon but now you think about okay if you break the hydrological pump and north america loses 30 to 50 percent of its rainfall what's the effect on the u.s. of that well it pretty much collapses the us as we understand it today we lose agriculture or agricultural production we lose our [3768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3768.31s)

aquifers it's we that creates massive both economic hits and [[national security]] threats so should the state department see the disruption of the amazon as a [[national security]] threat to the us yes they should do they currently no nobody's been thinking about that or putting those together does the state department have big-boy capabilities to intervene just like the multinationals [3794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3794.619s)

do with a different set of incentives where you're actually helping where you're where you're identifying the agents that have the ability to do something and helping change the incentive that they are oriented towards yeah that's a possible strategy so i've talked to some people about that state department they're like yes if we can see that that's a real thing then we [3819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3819.13s)

would ensure that didn't happen well that by sometime it's not a long-term solution because you can't be keeping economic development from happening for a long time so you also then have to propose better economic development opportunities for those countries but that also bind the predatory capitalism parts so rather than say we're gonna help you ecuador [3840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3840.16s)

build your own mining company rather than the chinese multinational come in and do the mining for you where they have no incentive to do environmental protection because they're gonna leave and don't give a  __  about the toxic tailings left and they don't even employ local people they bring their own people over and you make a penny on the dollar because you're just basically selling [3857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3857.74s)

the asset rights we're gonna help you create your own national mind where you employ people at a fair wage living there and it's environmentally safe and you have the right incentive to do it and you don't have to do anywhere near as much of it to make even more money because you have higher margins and can sell the things on the open market you just don't have the capability do [3877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3877.3s)

that upfront so we're gonna bring the capital and the and the contracting capabilities to help you do that we can't do that because i still doesn't bind the other thing what we say is can we get this if the state department got involved and said  __  we actually have to do this ongoingly and we can't do it militaristically we need to get the debt [3898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3898.35s)

forgiven can the state department put pressure on the world bank to forgive the debt based on their relationship sure it could could the world bank put pressure on the chinese government to do the same thing and not down grade the quality of their debt yeah they could there's an arrangement you could make there so now let's say we create an organization we start to talk to the [3915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3915.84s)

state department about that deal start to talk to the world bank about that they'll see how to kind of set that thing up and then we also look at how to do them mining properly that creates wealth for the people in the area and so we now we come to the president of ecuador and the other people and say look we have a deal we can get your debt forgiven and we can increase the [3937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3937.5s)

economic prosperity of your country more than it currently is while protecting the amazon well increasing your [[national security]] well making you time man magazine man of the year and a hero to your people and internationally and then you become the leader of how to best do developing nations in the south american region now here's the deal we've we've set up this whole bundle package and [3960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3960.45s)

we'll help you with it and will actually help kick off then not just the mining but the schools and all these other things and this because the mining will be very high profit but say schools and roads and county clinics need money subsidized from somewhere so we bundle it into a investable operating agreement where it's net profitable and highly securitized because it's basic [3986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=3986.37s)

infrastructure backed by their own government bonds in a world where most bonds are negative interest yielding right now so we can get massive pension funds with trillions of dollars to be able to get a couple percent return and they like the things so we say look here's the deal we will mezzanine finance this thing for you we'll open it up to the capital markets and get the [4005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4005.0s)

canadian and norwegian and other hedge funds to come in we'll negotiate a settlement of your debt we'll do all this kind of stuff but it's an all-or-nothing package like you either get the whole  __  bundle or you don't get any of it now can we make a more attractive bundle than the  __  up when they're giving and that's using manipulative tactics [4021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4021.14s)

but that are actually in the service of the environment and the people rather than  __  the the environment and the people to extract as much as we can and externalize that would be called using game a tools well towards a authentically game be oriented kind of purpose now ecuador starts doing better and brazil's like  __  we want this deal and you start to get a race to the top [4045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4045.049s)

between the countries right i learned about how to think about those complex kind of operating agreements from a friend named nelson del rio who's one of the best thinkers on this topic he helped develop the p3 model the public-private partnership and then saw how that got weaponized so he moved on to a project called prosperity of the commons and has has done really [4066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4066.47s)

brilliant work in the space like there's a million details of how that actually works and there's a million yeah but that couldn't work because such-and-such that are actually pretty well thought out from people that have had real experience working in that kind of cutthroat international development space but this is just an example right it's an example of how to increase [4087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4087.349s)

actual strategic and tactical effectiveness towards different goals appreciate daniel giving us that overview i think i got some of it i will remind others that this is recorded it will end up going on youtube so i know it takes me some time to go through and try and cure many many times but it sounds like a more comprehensive solution it's needed in terms of [4116](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4116.179s)

thinking about how we look at the amazon we have about maybe 15 minutes left i do want to pivot to a question that's probably closer to our hearts and pass it to peter thank you phil asked my question the moment but i just got a text i won't say who it's from but during the room oh my god please have daniels moktar berger come back on that on the sex thing he evaded with [4141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4141.139s)

weinstein so maybe we'll have time to squeeze that in after my question but just wanted for that there so yeah my question was about power literacy and legitimate power so at the store we have we're experimenting with a lot of different psycho texts we have wisdom gym that's forming i know there's different like techniques and modalities like version mapping and stuff like that [4164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4164.64s)

based off same old verges technique in order to kind of get power awareness and whatnot do you have any recommendations what we can do in this sort of body tribe that's forming at the stoy we feel kind of there's like a family there's like a loving tribe for me here and is there any recommendations that you can give us to get legitimate power and gain power literacy i remember when i first [4187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4187.109s)

read the 48 laws of power and i actually i read that and i hate i had read sun tzu but i hadn't read machiavelli and i hadn't read lacan and strauss and a number of the other like source materials yet and it was it was interesting i was very impressed with what he did i thought it was the worst book ever written and that obviously also means a valuable thing because he [4226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4226.44s)

took so much of military theory and courtier and political and like all of the evil stuff of game a and he both said one it's an excerpt and two its virtue that's always the path to the dark side actually pretty much always is power use of this kind is inexorable so arm on talking to gandalf saying sauron is gonna win there's no choice might as well beat us right might as well join us [4259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4259.08s)

rather than lose write it like that that story is always the case so i'll just share this because it's kind of interesting i had a conversation several years ago with one of the most powerful evil power brokers in the world long one-on-one where i was actually surprised at how much he kind of both was inviting me into his world and opening up about it and the way he [4291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4291.989s)

framed it goes like this i'll just do it briefly cuz it's important it's like look humans are animals animals are either predators or prey predators don't feel bad when they kill prey if you feel bad when the prey humans die it's because you're a prey human and you won't run the world the [[apex predator]] will run the world they will be the thing that determines the shape of an [4318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4318.239s)

overall ecosystem and whether you like what [[apex predator|apex predators]] do or not doesn't deter doesn't matter at all to the fact that [[apex predator|apex predators]] will be the ones who run the world so the only question is whether you have what it takes to make it into that group or not and so that's the inexorable argument right power in the form of predatory power is inexorable can't do anything about it [4340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4340.86s)

it's always gonna win well if that's the case and i can't effectively fight against it that just binds all kinds of moral possibilities as just stupid and naive so then the next part was power as virtue which he said and it's actually good that though [[apex predator|apex predators]] are the ones who run the world because they're the ones who are steely eyed and real and grounded enough to understand how [4365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4365.31s)

 __  works and the world is actually kind of brutal and people who just don't get how it  __  works can't guide stuff they'll make it worse sometimes you got to put a head on a spike in the yard to keep everybody else from being  __  and so it goes from power as inexorable to power as virtue and then some people stop there and then the last step is feeling good about exercising [4391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4391.59s)

your own power over because it says you are part of that class which becomes power s fetish which is the movement from sociopathy to sadism when you actually feta sized fetishize the exercising of it now of course everything he was saying was utter gibberish and it's important to know that and i didn't bring it up with him because i knew that wasn't [4417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4417.21s)

relevant in that moment i was basically getting more information i'm like a blue whale is neither predator nor prey in a traditional sense neither is an elephant the [[apex predator]] is lower on the food chain than a virus or a parasite or a mosquito in many ways you're pretending that there's this thing that isn't really there and you are not acknowledging that the [[arms race]] that has always won self terminates pretty soon because when you exponentiate externalization and war it actually destroys everything and so basically it's gibberish but it's compelling enough gibberish that if you kind of want to do it anyways it's [[plausible deniability]] so what robert greene did and the 48 laws of power was did the same move [4464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4464.76s)

right which is these types of power dynamics are inexorable if you don't know who the sucker in the room is it's you if you don't think these pap these games are at play either you're stupid or you actually do know they're at play and you're signalling naivete as a power trick itself or ignorant signaling or virtue signaling as a method of power and so that was the power is inexorable [4491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4491.58s)

and then the power has virtue is since this is the only way to be effective at getting anything done if you have any ethic or moral or scruple at all you better become excellent at this game of power so you have a chance to affect the things you care about and so it it basically tried to take whatever ethical immune system people had that would resist illegitimate evil applications of [4517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4517.77s)

power and say that's not possible and then actually hook it into those evil applications of power are the only ethical thing which is basically trying to turn an immune system into an autoimmune disease which some viruses and bacteria do exactly that thing right that's what's happened so one thing that i think is interesting is give people that book as an inoculation [4546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4546.96s)

what and oftentimes they don't get inoculated they get infected and they become worse people very commonly as people really start to see how compelling it is as it tells story after story of the person you trust who who was the most trusted  __  him over and gives example of how the person tried to say no really i am trustworthy because and they were all examples of  __  [4573](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4573.07s)

over it puts this little subconscious frame in the back of your head that everybody is a  __  out to get you and all trust is a vulnerability that's gonna mess you up so either you become a worse person after you become exposed to that or you embrace that those are real things but they aren't the only real thing and you decide from a deeper place that that [4593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4593.71s)

isn't the thing you're gonna do and you become it inoculated but now you don't you don't you're not naive to it so you don't lose to it so you don't set up trying to help the rainforest and lose to it because you know that  __   __  is happening but you say i actually think that there is a way to to beat it without becoming it so that's a very interesting inoculation so if people [4615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4615.73s)

become literate to the game of power wealth as a community while simultaneously becoming clear on legitimate and illegitimate uses and simultaneously clear on real versus signalling and the community has practices of helping each other with it that's what the  __  code of knighthood was right or any of those types of things was how do we develop [4637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4637.51s)

legitimate power in the service of the collective good and hold each other to that and that's totally missing right now and totally needed one thing about that i just want to say it's a it's important the reason that the biblical teaching don't let your right hand see what the left hand is giving right do your alms in the closet was acknowledging how problematic virtue [4670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4670.29s)

signaling is and trying to say if you have a if there is something that moves in you deeper than other people recognizing it deeper than the wounded insecure child or the mate signaling impulse if there is an authentic thing that you say this is actually worth more than me getting credit for in my life for a reason that is transcendent or spiritual then that [4694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4694.81s)

doesn't mean that there isn't still also wounded child and mate signaling desire in you you just have to be aware of which is which and one of the problems of any kind of set of ideals or developmental idea is as soon as we talk about the ideal or talk about what development in the direction of more moral more ethical more sovereign is then someone else can hear that and try [4719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4719.76s)

to do the behaviors that look like that thing without that actually being an embodied state and there's gonna be benefits to signaling that even earnestly even like the kid trying to act like the parent doing the thing so how do we increase people's earnestness to work on the real embodiment of their virtues rather than the signaling of them and the signaling only where that [4743](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4743.83s)

is actually necessary and effective for authentic purposes right right yeah i love that what came up when you're talking in sort of this ecology of practices that is emerging out of the stoah power literacy knowing it from a declarative stance and having an adjacent i call a practice or you just have a radical truthfulness as you refer to the truthfulness and then you can [4769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4769.63s)

speak on it openly amongst each other and in a bodied way so people are privately messaging me wanting the sex questions like ask them to sex question has an assessed question and we have a whole and we have like six minute stuff if they a lot of time is that something you want to feel there do you want - can we seduce you back somehow and for the session i mean trank trying to address [4790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4790.63s)

sex in six minutes is funny and i don't know what the second is it's like it's like trying to address power right now in a couple minutes to dialogue about the relationship between sexuality and power and the memes and cultural norms around sexuality the different kind of options that are there and what the consequence that associated with them is is a super [4817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4817.38s)

important and interesting topic and sure i'd be happy to do that sometime cool filled you have any final things you would like to run by daniel yeah no i i think there's definitely a lot more questions and i was trying to read through and see if we can fit another question i think i would just like to leave daniel if you'll have anything else that you wanted to say or leave the [4841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4841.54s)

audience with you i will also say this the sex question was specifically around i guess anti-rattle this is something of very much interest you can give us a cliffhanger on that and there's a very short book that i really loved that was one of the more influential books on me growing up it's by a jesuit priest who [4879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4879.4s)

is also a student of eastern traditions named anthony de mello the book is called the way to love and it's a tiny little pocket book of these kind of reflections or meditations there's a lot of ideas around sex that i would talk about that if people are not familiar with the ideas he brings up in there they won't actually have the basis for some of the [[value system]] so of course we can talk about it from an evolutionary buy out perspective and we have to do that and an economic perspective and a child-rearing perspective and all those things but insofar as the question around you know you have the the buddhist desire as the source of all suffering and the western desire is the source of all creativity and goodness and we're here to be creators made in [4934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4934.75s)

the image and likeness of the creator those are really different models about the nature of desire and that's actually something we kind of have to wrestle with and the whole topic of are there types of desire that are more destructive and types that are more healthfully constructive and do they come from different places is there desire from more wholeness or less [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4952.33s)

wholeness that leads in a direction of kind of increased wholeness individually and for the relationships versus addiction whatever so there's stuff around that that becomes the basis to think about sexual desire and sexual rivalry and all those types of things so yeah i recommend it in that book and i will be particularly inclined to come back and talk about it if i hear that a [4975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=4975.85s)

bunch of people have read it oh i can jump in here film hi and yeah it's funny daniel it's like that we had a session earlier today may be great is something on only fans at ross sexuality but he does coming on friday doing the lust-filled i'm you read my journals i'm horny all the time so we're becoming like existential perverse here at the stoma [5002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5002.3s)

so i think we're all gonna read that book and then get you back to talk about it so phil thanks for the i'm seeing and daniel thanks so much for coming today if people haven't read it wilhelm reich's work was very interesting on the topic i'm not saying i agree with it but it's it's one of the things it should be thought about he was basically saying what was wrong with [5022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5022.0s)

marxism and one of the things he assessed was that marxism didn't deal with sexual ownership and the the impulse for non communitarian things that arises actually in how to deal with that and that became actually one of the deep intellectual basis of the free love movement which i think is not the right answer but just to kind of understand one of the directions and specifically [5041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5041.24s)

it had to do with him looking at the relationship between sexual repression and violence across cultures which is very interesting sociologically and almost like the follow-up to that work half a century later was sex at dawn hmm which was influenced by that and so it's valuable to read sexy dawn it's also valuable to read the critiques of sex at dawn some of which are really deep and [5067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5067.31s)

important some of which are specious and those are all kind of some basis to start to have the conversation a little more informally right i think there's a book sex at dust it was a critic yeah yeah cool it's like largely specious but there's a few good things in there yes what i heard in century of the self has a pretty good mapping of that documentary series without i'm [5088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5088.49s)

curtis very cool so daniel thank you my friend for coming to the stove today maybe you can stick around for two minutes you can hear the upcoming events and maybe we can get yet some of them so for upcoming events of the store even do you want to talk about we have tomorrow with sam oh and then your event on friday yeah thank you so yeah we have live players with sam oberg [5110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvVdGNzCQk&t=5110.0s)
