daniel, welcome to the investment turnaround. 
it's an outstanding pleasure to have you and i'm   so looking forward to our conversation today. so 
in order for the people to get to know you better,   why don't you tell us what took you into the 
present moment in your life? what path? what   significant emotional and cognitive events 
participated to daniel schmachtenberger? oh my goodness, that is 
such an impossible question because there's so many different 
ways i could answer it so i guess   one through-line that is pretty central and is 
relevant to things i think we might discuss today.   i was homeschooled by parents that wanted 
to kind of run an educational experiment of   letting their kids design their 
own curriculum and this was   similar to some of the unschooling ideas 
now but before unschooling was a thing.   my parents interests were buckminster fuller and 
kind of design science and fritjof capra systems   [79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=79.52s)

science and kind of the philosophy coming 
out of modern physics and world religions   and spiritual traditions. and you know the 
best kind of thinking stuff coming out of the   hippie movement time period, and so 
obviously as a kid getting to design my   own curriculum being exposed to those things made 
a difference because no one's going to choose to   study something they don't even know exists and 
so it's nice to have those and so i was studying   the sciences and interested in how the 
world works, studying the philosophic   traditions around what we're really here 
for and what is, what is meaningful and and then in studying things like uh 
the bucky fuller design science work   thinking about how do we redesign the 
technological substrate of civilization   fundamentally those were kind of early interesting 
questions um and i got into activism very young   [145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=145.2s)

that was one of the other big areas and it got 
to be home school curriculum time so i got to do   a lot more like frontline activism stuff and 
research younger than a lot of people would   and it it started with animal rights stuff and 
started with factory farming and then went to   whaling and overfishing and [[species extinction]] 
and with peta and greenpeace and all those types   of organizations and that was the beginning of 
kind of existential devastation for me of how much   human induced unnecessary suffering and just 
rolling atrocity there is on the planet and then   how can i consider my life a success while that's 
happening like there has to be something wrong   with me that i can disconnect from that and just 
be happy to to party and so i remember the very   first thing when i was like nine years old that 
i had this feeling around with [[factory farm|factory farms]] was   if they still exist when i die then i failed at 
anything worth living for because hey i i can't   [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=206.72s)

have a world that i feel good about where that 
exists the hard part was i kept adding things   to that list because you know then start studying 
extreme poverty and then start studying the things   that lead to unnecessary wars and then um and this 
was kind of like the centrally torturing thing for   me was everybody said that these all are such 
hard issues that nobody's fixed them and so it   would take all of my life focusing on one of them 
maybe have a little bit of a chance and that means   ignoring all the other ones and i couldn't i just 
couldn't and fortunately the system science focus   started to give me a sense that maybe part 
of the problem was focusing on these things   in isolation and not what interconnected them and 
the underlying patterns that gave rise to them why   do humans make shitty choices why are we not good 
stewards of the technological power that we have   and uh you know so there were things that i knew i 
needed to study to be able to even think about it   [264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=264.88s)

well so i i i went and did university studies and 
studied math and physics and things that i knew   would be like important fundamental disciplines 
and philosophy and then independently studying   economics and [[social system|social systems]] and things like that 
and trying to look at all of the proposed systems   for how do we make a better world looking at 
the un sdg kind of model and looking at the   the bildung model can we make the whole world 
like the nordic countries and looking at the uh   anarcho-capitalists and libertarian models and 
and it didn't take that long to see how all of   those philosophies catastrophically failed in the 
face of [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and [[exponential tech]]   and that they were just nowhere near deep enough 
thinking for the actual nature of the problems   and that was a bummer because i think i hope 
i think i thought originally that there were   adequate solutions and i could just find them and 
join them and add energy to it and so it was very   [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=327.36s)

devastating for me the first time i went 
and engaged with people at the un to see uh   i remember the first conversation i had there 
was with a world food program director where   they were looking at a solution to address world 
hunger which was great but their solution involved   commercial agriculture going into areas where it 
doesn't currently exist to be able to feed the   people in a way that doesn't depend upon shipping 
food from other countries which made sense except   it was bringing more nitrogen-based fertilizers 
to more river deltas which will increase the   rate of [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean which is 
an [[existential risk]] for the whole planet   when i brought that up to them i'm like 
okay well you're going to feed more people   per year for a few years and then speed 
up the death of the oceans and everybody   they're like yeah we never thought of that and 
that's a bummer but those are not the metrics   [373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=373.52s)

we're tasked with we're tasked with defeating 
kids metrics i'm like are you  __  kidding me   and then i saw that everywhere and i saw that most 
of the work was not only not adequate to succeed   but it was causing other problems and other 
areas worse problems because we were defining   the problems too narrowly and the world was more 
interconnected than that and so this just led to having to continue to step back and say okay 
maybe we just need to do an assessment of the   whole [[problem space]] well enough to know what 
adequate solutions would take so that was   that was kind of the central thrust of my life 
focus and all the various areas of study were what   do i need to understand to be able to look at that 
uh so we were mentioning economics obviously we   can see that if i have a metric of optimizing gdp 
for a nation or gdp per capita or some metric like   that that war is really good uh gdp goes up under 
war if that sick people that spend more money on   [426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=426.08s)

medicine is good that there's a lot of perverse 
incentive that addiction is quite profitable   and so it's like okay well that's a 
dreadful metric and yet we can see that   underlying so many of the issues like bad 
medical systems and bad food systems and   driving addiction from supply side through 
manufactured demand is a [[economic system]]   that has [[perverse incentive]] writ large and 
there's something like 70 trillion dollars it   trades hands every day and i'm like if we got 70 
trillion dollars of decentralized human incentive   almost all of which is causing harm 
along a [[supply chain]] of action somewhere even if i had a billion dollars a day to spend 
that didn't even need to make money just pure   non-profit and i was maximally effective with 
it and i'm going against 70 trillion dollars a   day that is harm externalizing and it's easier to 
break stuff than it is to fix it or to build it i   [477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=477.36s)

can i can destroy a house much faster than i can 
build one i'm so many orders of magnitude off of   being adequate so i'm like anything that does not 
change [[perverse incentive]] is not even worth doing   so how do we change 70 trillion dollars a day 
worth of human activity to not have perverse   incentive built in well it doesn't look like 
our current [[economic system]] it looks like   a fundamentally new [[economic system]] so how 
do we how do we make projects that succeed   within this [[economic system]] and externalize 
a bunch of harm was never interesting to me   how do we make a fundamentally how do we make 
an [[economic system]] where the success of that   [[economic system]] and the thriving of life are 
aligned with each other is a different question   and uh so yeah then one of the things i saw 
was as i was looking at all these different   problems and how they were looking at 
how they were interconnected to see how   [526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=526.08s)

trying to solve one would move problems somewhere 
else and we'd see that all over the place the you   know example that i gave about nitrogen runoff 
is one but we can take pretty much any example   and but then also looking at what do all the 
problems have in common as the at the level of   [[generator function|generator functions]] and [[perverse incentive]] is one 
example but there's a number of things that are   the underlying system dynamics and by system 
dynamics here we're not talking like healthcare   as a system or or the judicial system as a system 
we're talking about underneath that the patterns   of human behavior what is creating patterns of 
human behavior so i i started forecasting also   i was trying to see are these problems are the 
problems getting better are they getting worse   and the answer is of course both and so you can 
you can read plenty of books um pinker and hans   rosling and all those books on why everything 
is getting better and if you cherry pick the   [582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=582.64s)

stats and you decontextualize them sure that's 
true but you read most any environmental metrics   not any but so many environmental metrics 
and also catastrophic and [[existential risk]]   and you can see how many things are getting 
not just worse but precipitously towards   the non-viability of civilization worse and 
so when i saw that some things were getting   better some things were getting worse i 
saw a phase of civilization destabilizing   and that clearly we didn't just need more of the 
type of actions that we were doing more nonprofit   projects more impact investing more un sdg stuff 
more laws being made and more tech solutions   because the whole body of all of that was not 
converging towards adequate because the pro   every year we were getting more total catastrophic 
risks and higher probability on each of them   when crispr comes along we have way more chance 
of all dying from [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] with development   of agi we have way more chance of dying from 
agi-based risks with the development of drones   and the weaponization of drones their ability 
to take out infrastructure so it's like okay the   the total probability space of catastrophe is it 
rapidly expanding and if you look at the un world   we haven't solved any of the sdgs they were 
called the millennium development goals before   we didn't solve them the we never succeeded with 
this nuclear d proliferation since the un started   we went from two countries with nukes to lots of 
countries with nukes and faster nukes and better   nukes we haven't stopped [[arms race|arms races]] on a single 
new type of technology we have an [[arms race]] on   drones we have an [[arms race]] on ai we have arms 
race on cyber weapons on bio weapons we haven't   been able to deal with any of the major tragedy 
of the commons like [[climate change]] or overfishing   so it's like all right our our problem-solving 
processes writ large are not adequate to the   [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=691.36s)

problems we face so we shouldn't have 17 sdgs 
we should have one superordinate one that is   develop the capacity to coordinate 
effectively towards global level issues   if we don't have that we don't get any of 
the other ones if we do get that we get all   the other ones so how do we develop better 
coordination capacities towards global level   issues like [[arms race|arms races]] and tragedy of the commons 
and things like that and uh yeah so that that's   kind of been the through line is seeing all of the 
problems seeing how they're interconnected seeing   what's underlying and driving them seeing where 
the solutions have some effectiveness but are   inadequate and thinking about and working towards 
what what would new problem-solving processes   adequate to the problems that we actually 
face look like and how do we bring those about brilliant so how do we you mentioned agi i just 
wanted to explain agi is artificial general   [756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=756.0s)

intelligence as an explanation so how do we what 
are the acupuncture points obviously there are   enough smart people on this planet to be able 
to develop this whole system thinking and come   up with solutions why what makes it so difficult 
for um for such people to come together and come   up with solutions and implement them because 
obviously there are many many people who come   you know have these solutions but they don't 
have the political power the influence the   money whatever to uh to make them happen so 
what are the fault lines of existing systems   and what are the possibilities we have to find 
these acupuncture points and influence them   so that we it just to frame me uh let 
me frame this a little bit better you   are went on record saying that we're 
currently facing world war three   and uh it's not kinetic so we don't really see 
it we don't really we think it's peace and it's   [827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=827.52s)

wonderful and we all can whatever whatever 
be blessed to buy this and that and the other   but in reality we are deep at war with one another 
and we are on our best way toward extinction   it's only a question of time so how do we save 
ourselves it's just a simple question for you dear so everybody knows that the thing we call politics 
and the thing we call war or a gradient of   basically rivalrous interests uh 
von clausewitz famously said war   is politics extended by other means and 
but it's it's more like the other way it's   more like politics is how we sublimate war 
where we want different things um and yet you know diplomatic warfare economic warfare 
cyber warfare narrative and information warfare   population central warfare are those politics 
or those well they're outside of the domain   of what we consider the agreed upon political 
process they're not kinetic warfare world war   [899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=899.6s)

ii was kind of the end of kinetic warfare being a 
viable solution for the major powers because any   weapons that the major powers used against each 
other to really be able to deal with it could   escalate and we had weapons now big enough that 
you have a war that nobody wins so after that we had to depend on proxy wars which we've done 
a lot of we've noticed there have been no major   superpower wars since world war ii heaps of 
proxy wars well in order to fight a proxy war   you again have to base it off propaganda oh they 
have weapons of mass destruction no they don't   but you have to tell that story to be able to go 
invade and do that thing or um and that is a kind   of non-kinetic warfare right so we fight proxy 
wars and we fight non-kinetic unconventional wars so is it fair to say that the world is in peace 
time right now no i don't think that's fair   to say i think we can see the total number of 
cyber attacks that are obviously not peacetime   [960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=960.56s)

we can see the um increase in total numbers of 
[[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] the first real catastrophe   weapon we had was the bomb and before that 
the major empires of the world always fought   there were never times where they didn't fight 
that was how we dealt with our border issues uh   world war ii was the beginning of having weapons 
so big that we couldn't fight as the solution or   at least the major powers couldn't fight and 
so the whole world before world war ii and the   world after fundamentally different because before 
that we weren't powerful enough to ruin everything   and so world war ii is the beginning of 
technologically induced [[catastrophic risk]]   so we had to make so we had to be able to 
do something we'd never done which have the   superpowers not war so we had to make an entire 
new [[world system]] a globalized [[world system]] for   the first time ever and it bought us like 75 years 
of no superpower war there was a cold war there   [1014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1014.88s)

were proxy wars or other things and that involved 
[[mutually assured destruction]] it involved a bunch   of ngos right the the un and the world bank and 
imf and all those types of structures because   we realized that national governments only weren't 
enough to prevent world war and so we needed these   other things and a whole globalization system 
where we we became so economically interdependent   on each other that we had more incentive to 
do trade with each other than we did to war   and so we can see that the computer that 
we're talking on today the microphone the   all of it no country in the world can build 
right the from the mining of the materials   to the refinement of them to the hardware to the 
software to the satellite production that is our   internet is communicating over all takes six 
continent [[supply chain|supply chains]] to make well when you   have that much interconnectedness you aren't 
oriented to blow each other up which is nice   [1066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1066.72s)

but you get other problems which is you get 
radical fragility so you get a problem in   one area of wuhan and the whole world 
shuts down right and you get catas you   get cascading catastrophic failures you have to 
to stop a virus in a world that connected you   shut down transportation in a way where now you 
realize the flow of fertilizer and pesticides   that now got shut down just drove the poverty 
of the 100 million uh poorest people into much   worse conditions and we had locusts throughout 
northern africa and parts of the middle east   because not having the pesticides you can see 
like all these second and third order effects   also a major part of that world that globalization 
world was we will use industrialization to extract   resources from the earth way faster so that we 
can be so positive gdp that everybody can get   more without taking each other's stuff and the 
idea there is that if gdp is not high enough   [1119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1119.04s)

everyone's desire to have more makes them go zero 
sum and have to take each other's stuff and so   the answer is there has to keep being more well 
more with a linear [[materials economy]] where you're   taking stuff on renewably and then turning it into 
trash on renewably you can't run an exponential   linear [[materials economy]] on a finite planet for 
all that long and so what we see is that that   [[bretton woods]] world that kept us from warring for 
like 75 years till now has just come to an end   because we reach [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] so we can't 
keep running the linear [[materials economy]] that way   we have enough uh fragility in the overall 
system that the types of local collapses that   are inevitable now create global cascading 
collapses and we can't do mutually assured   destruction anymore because we don't have one 
[[catastrophe weapon]] and two superpowers that have   it we have dozens of [[catastrophe weapon|catastrophe weapons]] and many 
many actors including non-state actors including   people we don't even know who have it well how do 
you do a force nash equilibrium how do you do a   mutation or destruct you don't all right so now 
we're in a new situation there's the whole world   up to world war ii there's world war two till 
now there's a new thing where you could say   that the orienting question that i find 
one of them i find most interesting is around why humans have not been very 
good stewards of power why we have been   shitty stewards of power which both looks 
like war environmental destruction and um   shitty [[social system|social systems]] and subjugation and whatever   and we can see that as we've gotten more 
technological power those same underlying   issues of not being good stewards of power just 
become bigger deals um and with exponential power   like it's really important to get that 
the ability to engineer new life forms   [1241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1241.28s)

to crisp or genetically engineer new life forms 
this is not the power of an [[apex predator]] this is   not something that a gorilla or a polar bear or a 
orca can do this is the power of gods the ability   to extinct species at 13 a day the ability to 
destroy whole ecosystems to build totally new   environments the the anthropocene where we are 
the largest force affecting the surface of the   earth more than geology uh the ability to build 
[[artificial intelligence]] that has that has the   ability to paperclip maximize the world that this 
is the power of gods that requires something like   the love and wisdom of gods to guide it or it 
blows itself up so while this has always been   an interesting topic of how do we become better 
stewards for our power it is now a critical topic   because rather than just having local wars and 
local environmental destruction which we've   had for the last ten thousand years exponential 
warfare blows everything up on a finite planet   [1293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1293.92s)

exponential externalities in the finite planet 
so [[exponential tech]] is a forcing function for us   to become good stewards of the amount of power 
we have or for the human experiment to complete so a way of thinking about it if we take 
[[exponential tech]] and the emergence of it   as the center of our inquiry which i 
think is the right way to look at it we take a real politic view and just look at 
what is happening and what is going to happen   just we can say that world war ii was there's a bunch of other 
ways of looking at it this isn't the only way   but it's a useful way world war ii is a 
few competing social ideologies competing   over a chunk of new tech that was all made 
possible by a level of science so you've got   communism you've got fascism and you've got 
capitalism [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] something like   that and basically physical chemistry right atomic 
physics physical chemistry got to a place where   the bomb the v2 rocket the computer and chemistry 
all basically came on board at the same time   and germany was way further ahead than the soviets 
or the us for different reasons and we realized   that was existential and had to catch up and so 
the us did the manhattan project and invested   like crazy which was not market investment that 
was state investment the market did not build   the nuclear bomb right it didn't figure out 
computation so the idea that markets innovate   and states don't is utter gibberish because both 
germany and the us and the ussr that developed   all those things the apollo projects sputnik 
et cetera those were all done by states not by   markets and markets have never done anything 
of that scale of development before or after   um so we can see we can think of that as a few 
competing social ideologies for who would get the   [1415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1415.04s)

new tech because whoever would get the new tech 
would rule the world and we can see that the us   kind of came out ahead so we get a [[bretton woods]] 
world rather than a soviet contracted world or   whatever else will the tech jump we're at right 
now the center of it this time is computation   computation gives exponential returns rather 
than multiplicative returns because i can make   a piece of software once and then sell it an 
infinite number of times with no cost of goods   sold and no cost to transport the bits that's 
very different anything in the domain of atoms   or energy i have cost of goods sold and cost 
to transport the energy of the bits or whatever   so computations at the center and at the very 
center of that is ai and then coming out from   there is the application of ai and computation 
to upgrading the computational substrates   quantum computing photo computing dna computing 
etc other critical computational capacities   [1469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1469.12s)

crypto type stuff uh and then the application of 
that to things in the domain of atoms and energy   so biotech by being able to apply ai to protein 
folding nanotech because of that material science   is because of that robotics that are run by ai all 
those kinds of things that chunk of tech that is   emerging right now is orders of magnitude more 
significant than the world war ii chunk of tech who only those who are directing 
it will have any say in the future   because it is that much more powerful and 
power has been what determines the future   and this is the real politic assessment 
right now there are only two types of   groups as far as i see it that are 
trying to direct that type of tech authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] and corporations so authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] china 
is not the only one and i'm not saying   even the china isn't doing things that are 
quite smart and reasonable of course they are   china's not leaving the development of its tech 
completely to a market that isn't aligned with   the long-term plan of its country it has a 
long-term plan for the country it makes sure   that what the market does is aligned with it so 
if a corporation starts to do something that is   too far outside of what would benefit it like the 
ant group started to do they bring it back in line   they have a huge amount of r d themselves as a 
country which so they're applying ai and attention   technology and iot and robotics and whatever 
to making a better country not just a military   not just a economy but a better nation-state right 
and so this is why they have been able to not only   make high-speed trains within their country but 
export them all around the world and the us hasn't   built one within its own country this is why they 
have something like 94 percent of the [[supply chain]]   on rare earth metals this is why they you 
know have the majority of lithography and um   like really foundational things so we can see that 
uh an authoritarian-style nation-state that can   because they don't have term limits they don't 
have a [[perverse incentive]] to only do  __  that   will create returns within four years so they get 
re-elected uh so they can do long-term planning   because they don't have two parties fighting 
against each other they have the ability to   not have all their energy used 
up as internal friction and heat   right so they can actually do fairly decently 
coordinated long-term planning well that's just   a more effective system this particular point so 
you see that then in the west you see that the   development of the [[exponential tech]] is 
mostly not happening by the government   we don't have to see manhattan project type 
activities we see narrow applications in the   [1636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1636.0s)

military but the military is not the government 
it's not how the state tends to the people it's   not a better system of democracy it's not a 
better system of educating the people it's   not a better system of creating a healthy 
economy where people have something like the possibility of upward mobility all of that's 
left to the market but the market that is doing it   the people who are running it aren't elected they 
don't have accountability to the people they don't   have jurisprudence of these kinds so you can see 
that the companies that are developing the tech   are becoming exponentially more powerful companies 
and they're becoming so powerful that they're more   powerful than countries in many ways facebook and 
google have more users than china and the us can   bind up people and they have more data on them 
and they have more behavioral influence over them   that's  __  powerful right and not only is 
that not strengthening the us outside of gdp even   [1684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1684.4s)

though they don't pay taxes proportionately it's 
destroying the basis of the u.s functioning right   those are running a business model that optimizes 
people's time on site uses ai to optimize time on   site which happens by appealing to people's biases 
and in-group identities and all that kind of stuff   which actually polarizes people against each 
other so much that anything like democracy   becomes impossible so we see that exponential 
tech is making exponentially powerful companies   and actually destroying western democracies and 
republics in the process so that converges towards   a new feudalism and so we have basically 
[[exponential tech]] has two attractors either   it causes [[catastrophic risk]] directly and so you 
just don't have civilization anymore or you get   shitty civilizations you have two options within 
each of those shitty civilizations look like   authoritarian [[nation state|nation states]] that are empowered 
with [[exponential tech]] or feudalism that's   empowered with [[exponential tech]] the catastrophic 
risks like two kinds exponential externalities   which equals destruction via [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] 
and environment and stuff uh or exponential   warfare which looks like different things that 
lead to escalation pathways to world war three   so those are the four attractors i 
would say that are out there right now   and they're all bad they're all dystopic 
so i'm interested in a new attractor   and given that only those who are directing 
[[exponential tech]] will have the power to   have a say in the future but we want to have 
[[exponential tech]] not be used dumbly in a way that   causes [[catastrophic risk]] but also not create a 
type of civilization that is undesirable for the   majority of the people right that is not aligned 
with uh [[participatory governance]] and high civil   liberties and things like that then we get a very 
clear design constraint the design constraint is   [1799](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1799.12s)

that the number one imperative of the world of 
civilization if they are paying any damn attention   needs to be the development the development and 
implementation of the new emerging categories   of [[exponential tech|exponential technologies]] to making new social 
technologies to making democracy 2.0 republic 2.0   [[open society|open societies]] that are both aligned with 
the kinds of values that we care about   they'll be different right and they should 
be different the idea that you just vote on   propositions or the propositions you have no 
say in and they're made by special interest   groups and they're all bad and if you vote 
yes it benefits one thing and hurt something   else which is why fifty percent vote for it and 
fifty percent don't it polarizes the population   that's not democracy voting is not democracy 
democracy is a way that people can participate in   governance that's a stupid system so will the new 
systems look like just digital voting no they'll   [1854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1854.88s)

look like better ways to actually be engaged 
in the crafting of the propositions themselves   so we can come up with better propositions that 
don't have such unnecessary theory of trade-offs   and so it's not that we're trying to make exactly 
the same structure but a digital version we're   trying to make something that's aligned with the 
same values of uh both maximizing the integrity of   the commons and maximizing individual freedoms and 
creative expression and like that within that and   so how do we engage [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] to make 
new [[social tech|social technologies]] new [[open society|open societies]] that   can preserve the right and advance the 
right types of civil liberties and values   and guide the [[exponential tech]] safely so 
that it doesn't cause [[catastrophic risk]]   to me that's the only imperative worth 
anything because if we don't do that the   other things won't matter they won't end 
up being able to happen so when you asked   [1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1913.68s)

how do we go about it that's an answer at 
a very high level but it's a starting place brilliant thank you so let me just summarize it 
on you know the last thing that you said i heard   you say that we need to develop a new attractor 
other than the ones that are currently dominating   and your solution or and another alternative is 
what elon musk is doing getting ready to colonize   mars uh because he i don't think he he hopes 
or believes that we will be able to uh develop   our consciousness to the point where we will be 
able to implement uh the social engineering that   you are just uh if not we will probably export 
the same social failures to that system so the   thing about the mars colony that's actually 
great it's not the mars colony itself it's   the [[thought experiment]] why it's a good thought 
experiment is because import is really hard and so   if i'm trying to build a civilization on mars 
it has to do everything without import and so   [1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=1983.36s)

if i'm in a bubble where we're producing our own 
oxygen we're all stuck in the bubble do i want any   pollution at all for manufacturing none nothing 
nothing how many people can i have in prison   that are breathing oxygen and not doing stuff 
nobody everybody has to be meaningfully engaged   well how do i prevent crime completely and 
have a better process for conflict resolution   we have to do our own biotech in that world a 
gdp maximization is the thing that matters i   don't want sick people how do i prevent um you 
know health issues so how do we optimize health   uh how do we make sure that all the new stuff 
we need to make we can make from the old stuff   because we can't get new stuff easily what minimum 
set of tooling do we need to build the rest of the   tools and would we build the text act the same 
way that we did or would we rebuild the text   act differently this is what's interesting about 
it how would we do law would we import the same   [2034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2034.96s)

system of law or would we do law fundamentally 
differently would we even have the values that   are the basis of it be rethought through 
so the mars colony is interesting for earth   if we take the [[thought experiment]] seriously 
enough that we start thinking about oh wow   we're powerful enough now that designing 
civilization from scratch is a possible thing   well let's design this one from scratch 
differently what would that look like so how do we how do we and then you know 
you may want to uh dive into the consistence   project which is your project which i i highly 
i'm fired up about it so how do we begin to   design a new [[social tech|social technology]] and 
re-engineer society basically what are the   i think the best words or what are the the best 
levers to implement that i mean how do we begin   i i think just like elon musk is uh using his idea 
to go to mars as a means to achieve the technology   [2097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2097.76s)

to shift the mind and technology and everything 
how can we do an earth shot on social engineering and you may want to take a tangent yeah   and just address because you wrote the word term 
social engineering and um that word has a very   negative connotation for many people um in the 
u.s very intensely and so i want to speak to that when we say social engineering a social 
system a society a society or a civilization   we can think about what essentially is 
that it's a way for a lot of people who   don't all know each other beyond a tribal 
scale to coordinate their actions usefully that's kind of fundamentally what it's about and 
tribal systems before that were different because   there were not that many people and everybody 
knew everybody and but if we now have a place   where i have to compromise my actions in 
some way for people who i don't even know   [2177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2177.68s)

and we're all going to kind of get along well 
and we but how are we all going to get along   well and how are we going to do division of 
labor and specialization and then share the   stuff that we produced in a way that creates more 
kind of wealth and possibility for everybody we   have to have some systems of coordination so i 
think of civilization is coordination systems   civilizations fail either because they can't bring about 
the order and coordination necessary so   they fail in the direction of chaos or the 
way they bring about the order is imposed   so there's some okay here's rule of law and 
we're going to impose this rule of law by   force and so then it becomes increasingly 
oppressive and then it fails for those reasons   and so civilizations teeter between oppression 
and chaos right so we say how do we get out   [2230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2230.72s)

of that how do we have something that is not 
oppression and is not chaos well we need order   but we want the order to not be imposed so we need 
order that's emergent how would we possibly have   [[emergent order]] this is the idea of a democracy 
or a republic or an [[open society]] of participatory   governance and you notice that they were aligned 
whenever they emerged in the world they were   aligned with some idea of an enlightenment of some 
kind a social enlightenment that had the idea and   if we look at modern democracies emerging 
out of the kind of european enlightenment   the key in the european enlightenment was the 
philosophy of science and the idea that we   could all come to do the same experiment get the 
same result and there was an inherently unifying   property to the nature of objective reality so 
we could make sense of the same world because   what we're trying to coordinate is the choices 
we make well what's the basis of our choices   [2283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2283.04s)

our [[sensemaking]] and our [[meaning making]] inform our 
choice making our [[sensemaking]] is what do we think   is going on and what do we think an action would 
be that would move us towards the thing we want   what do we want is our [[meaning making]] our values 
generation right so ultimately our ability to   figure out what we value and what's going on and 
how we think we can advance the values how we do   choice making so the idea that we need to if we 
want to have coordinated choice making we need   to coordinate our [[sensemaking]] can we all come to 
be able to assess reality similarly and we have to   be able to coordinate our values and so can we run 
a hegelian dialectic right can we run a dialectic   where rather than just say that because it seems 
like you're optimizing for something else you're   evil can i try to understand the value that you're 
trying to optimize for that has some real value so   at first you're voting for proposition 
a and proposition a is going to as far   [2332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2332.32s)

as i'm concerned hurt the owls in this area 
so you must just be a non-environmental evil    __  except i'm like why do you want to do 
that well for the economy what does that mean   well it means that you are actually in a resource 
insecure situation and your kids don't have job   prospects and that proposition a looks like it 
will actually give your kids a better opportunity   to have a good life so the value for you is the 
opportunity space for your kids lives okay well   maybe you're not an evil  __  maybe that's a 
real value and maybe you don't even not care about   the owls you're just forced into a situation where 
that proposition unnecessarily polarized them   is there a way to care and but you think 
that i'm evil because i want your kids to   be poor for some  __  owls right well what 
if we just say how do we take all the values   and recognize that they 
are not necessarily opposed   [2387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2387.52s)

and try to take all the values before we come 
up with the proposition and then come up with   a proposition that meets the values the best the 
best that it can we don't even try to do that most   of the time now a special interest group will make 
a proposition based on some very narrow value that   of course externalizes harm to other things we're 
not even trying to do a better job of that so the   idea of a democracy though and earlier democracies 
did try because of smaller scale like in the us   you weren't making huge choices they were mostly 
in a town hall where everybody could just talk   and so a special interest group wasn't making 
the proposition we were all talking we said what   about this idea well that's not quite right 
because of this what about this idea and you   could leave sometimes without even voting because 
everyone would just agree this is the thing to do   the there's a quote by one of the founding fathers 
of the u.s something to the effect of the death   [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2432.96s)

the voting is the death of democracy because 
it means that we didn't have a good enough   conversation to come to shared understanding and 
then the vote was a way to sublimate violence um but the idea of can we get [[emergent order]] well 
if we can unify our [[sensemaking]] that we can make   sense of reality similarly and we can unify our 
values can i try to understand your perspective   you can try to understand mine well enough that 
we say now let's put all these values together   and then let's use design process to design a 
solution that will meet everybody's values as   best as possible maybe not perfectly but as best 
as possible factoring the physical constraints   that our [[sensemaking]] shows us that's the right 
kind of direction to be able to get [[emergent order]]   well we can see that since the modern democracies 
have emerged the world has gotten much more   complex technologically ecologically etc and 
our capacity for shared [[sensemaking]] and shared   [[meaning making]] meaning our training in civic 
virtue to listen to each other well with good   faith and our training in the relevant areas to 
understand the world has gotten worse right and so social engineering the kind of social engineering 
that brings about order through imposition   we're not interested in what we want is 
something that actually makes that kind   of social engineering impossible because the 
people recognize propaganda and manipulation   of those things when it happens because 
they have good [[sensemaking]] capability   and where that is so it's both impossible and 
not necessary because the people can actually   coordinate so what we're looking 
for is how do we socially engineer   a world where that type of social engineering 
is both not necessary and not possible now another way of speaking to it is [2543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2543.2s)

conditioning of people is not avoidable you 
can't not condition people right they're   they're going to be born and learn mandarin if 
that's what they're hearing or they're going to   learn english or they're going to learn german 
or they're going to learn whatever that can just   what they're hearing is conditioning them right 
it's conditioning them to think a certain way   it's going to condition their aesthetics their 
values their whatever based on what they observe   so we have to realize that you can't not condition 
people so given that it's inexorable what is a   meaningful human life what what is a civilization 
that enhanced that makes meaningful human life   possible and how do we want to condition people 
such that they both have the best life possible   and can contribute that we have a civilization 
that makes the best life possible for the people   and people that are disposed to live their 
life in a way that in turn contributes to   [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2591.76s)

a civilization in other people so i 
just wanted to say that briefly about   social engineering is that there is an 
element of association before you move on um   i'm german i'm a german citizen uh half 
romanian and germany's been very well known for   voting green and for decades we now had the green 
party in a leading political position in various   states within uh and now they have the opportunity 
to really go away go away from the opposition into   leading at the next election leading germany 
and one of the i'm referring to question as to   how to implement what you just said because 
one of the and i am a green voter obviously   but one of the reasons why they were not leading 
a leading political party over the past 16 years   has to do although they tried has to do with 
from my perspective with the fact that they   try to well first of all they went into these 
never-ending conversations where no decisions   [2666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2666.24s)

were taken or if a decision was taken they were 
trying to impose it on other people like eating   you know not not eating meat on fridays and that 
of course that and i'm i'm a vegan so i don't uh i   don't have a problem with that but that led people 
to not vote for them so my question is how do we optimize for the integrity of the whole or the 
wholeness in trying to come up to an emergent   order without ending you know in in these endless 
conversations and not having to impose a decision   on to people that do not agree with and lose 
political power and leadership for that matter   am i making myself understood yeah thank you i think the idea of the masses is class propaganda i think that if i want to be a ruling class 
the idea that most people are too dumb   [2751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2751.04s)

and unmotivated and lazy and irrational 
to rule themselves well and so we kind of   have to rule because we are the ones who 
know what is right and good that's a very   convenient belief for those who happen to 
think they're part of that class and so if i   if i look in in i'll speak about the us because i 
know it's better so if i look at the dumb masses   that don't think africa is a country and can 
laugh at them and whatever which you we see   right there's a elite focus we'll we'll do that 
in the us but i look at the schools they went to   and they're shitty schools then i look 
at where do the wealthy kids go to school   and go to a place like exeter academy what exeter 
academy the average person becomes like a senator   right and like the people that do the worst 
still become partners at a law firm and i think if i took that person 
who thinks africa's a country   [2822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2822.4s)

who had a shitty school parents no tutors and 
put them in the same position and put them in   exeter academy with the right tutors and teachers 
and everything around they would be similar so   the masses are the result of how we condition the 
people and this is why benjamin franklin said if   that the ultimate depository of the power must be 
the people there's no other thing that is actually   a trustworthy depository of the power and if we 
believe the people too uneducated to be a safe   vessel the only answer is educate them 
better everything else becomes evil   it's a big damn task but look at the 
options right the other options are uh starting with the idea that i i'm meritocratically 
better right i know what is true and good and   right better so i'm willing to like let's say i'm 
gonna do this thing about nobody's allowed to eat   meat on friday whatever it is because otherwise 
[[climate change]] in the whole world will end and you   know it seems like it seems like it's worth kind 
of forcing people what i'm saying is wait is that   a law does that mean i'm going to take someone to 
jail if they violate it does that mean we're going   to use a monopoly of violence via a police force 
with an internal kind of military capacity to take   away people's freedoms because i'm so certain 
that we know what is right that we're willing   to implement it with a monopoly of violence where 
does that go as you keep going with that process what legitimate authority is legitimate enough to 
be maintained not being corrupted in the presence   of that so basically when you come back to the 
early narrative i said that the problems that we   face today are not being solved by our current 
problem-solving processes so we don't just need   more business solutions and non-profit solutions 
and et cetera we need fundamentally new types of   institutions that have the right characteristics 
to solve these types of problems well who's going   [2943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2943.84s)

to build those new institutions and it's important 
to get when we look at like the world has built   totally new types of government and new types of 
institutions for 200 000 years it was tribalism   and it wasn't until the emergence of the plow 
and baskets and a few things that we started   to get the different types of empires right and 
then that kind of emerged into certain dominant   types of empires and feudalism and then feudalism 
for so long that like the idea of something like   [[nation state|nation states]] and markets was that wasn't even 
an idea that that would that it would go that   direction and that new thing and then obviously 
post world war ii not just [[nation state|nation states]] but like   intergovernmental organizations at a global 
scale and multinational corporations so the   world does evolve at [[social tech|social technology]] and we 
can see that when the founding fathers of the us   were founding the constitution they 
didn't have ai as an issue to worry about   [2996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=2996.16s)

they didn't have eight billion people they didn't 
have [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] that were coming up they   didn't have such interconnected [[supply chain|supply chains]] 
that a break in one area could break everything   they didn't have the capacity for a digital 
democratic system they had to try to fit people in   who would ride horses to fit them into a town hall 
so they were not trying to solve the problems we   need to solve today with their system the 
people who created the idea of markets and   the scottish enlightenment von mises and hayek 
and rand were not trying to solve these problems   and neither was marx neither was 
any of the social theorists so we   need fundamentally new social theory that 
starts with understanding our [[problem space]] and so the [[problem space]] requires new institutions 
and new problem solving capacities those have to   emerge from people popularly starting to want 
them care about them be willing to empower   [3049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3049.92s)

them and participate with them so that the 
power of governance emerges from the consent   of the governed otherwise it will be imposed 
which is its own [[dystopia]] wonderful would you   like to dive into the consilience project as a 
contribution to achieving that goal of creating   developing a new social theory and education 
system to um to implement that to inform   the public space and avoid um you know ai and 
what google and twitter and facebook are doing yeah so everything we're talking 
about is the [[problem space]] that   the consultants project is focused on and um i'll take one more tangent first just because i 
think some of what i'm referencing might not be   grounded an example for 
people it might be helpful um i'm guessing that most of the people 
who are listening to this are aware   [3119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3119.92s)

of many of the types of [[existential risk]] that 
[[exponential tech|exponential technology]] makes possible if not   go watch nick bostrom give a 
short overview of it on ted but uh you know briefly things like nukes are 
hard to make not that many places have uranium   it's hard to enrich uranium you can see who has 
it because it's radioactive from a satellite   it's not hard to make drone weapons commercial 
drones are good you can 3d print drones   being able to put the charges on them are easy 
you can take out infrastructure targets that way   infrastructure targets can lead to pretty big 
cascading failures if you know which targets to   look at we can see that that's happened a couple 
times recently and they were they weren't even   really good targets they were small things but you 
know the drone a couple years ago hit a ukrainian   munitions factory and little omega drone did the 
level of damage that an incendiary bomb would take [3175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3175.6s)

run that out a few years see that tech getting   better and think about it you're like all right 
well how does and now think about how how cheap   crisper gene drives are and how easy cyber attacks 
on infrastructure are the thing that happened   with the pipeline the on the atlantic coast 
shutting down recently where nobody could get gas   we've known about that for a long time nobody's 
done anything to protect for 25 years we've known   that was a type of risk but now it's easy it 
was kind of hard before now it's super easy   so if we have decentralized meaning not just state 
actors but non-state actors we have decentralized   exponentially more powerful which could mean 
exponentially more catastrophic technology how   does the world remain anti-fragile in the presence 
of that it's a big question right it's a big   question for the most part western countries 
aren't even taking the question seriously   [3238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3238.4s)

china is taking it seriously their 
answer involves ubiquitous surveillance   it's not a dumb answer it's a problematic 
answer um it's a smarter answer than no answer   what's a better answer we need to really there 
are i would propose better answers than that but   just to say if people have not thought about 
how [[exponential tech]] causes [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]]   go look into that uh i have a podcast 
where i talk about that a bunch   that but when the other example of how could 
any of these emerging areas of tech innovate   in [[social system|social systems]] i'll just give a couple 
examples just so you can start thinking about it you think about new computer 
technology like [[blockchain]]   or some other kind of 
decentralized uncorruptable ledger what if all government spending was on a 
[[blockchain]] which meant that it could be   perfectly audited transparently by anybody and you 
could see where the money flowed with the total   prominent provenance of data and there couldn't 
be any missing money and there couldn't be emails   that got lost or burned or whatever because 
you had uncorruptable ledgers or transparent   well there's a whole bunch of corruption that 
just can't happen now you just made it impossible   through a kind of technologically enforced 
transparency that's pretty great like that changed   a lot of stuff when you start to look at how much 
unaccounted for money there are in federal systems look at ai technology you look at the ability 
of ai to take a number of different faces and   make a new face that isn't actually a real 
human face but looks like a real human face   because they averaged these different faces 
they can do that with sound other things someone actually just emailed me a proposition 
they're working on about this the other day and   [3357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3357.44s)

such a well-formed proposition what if 
we use the same underlying ai technology   to look at a semantic field of proposals that 
people have and come up with a new proposition   that is the weighted center of all of those 
propositions could we actually factor a humongous   amount of human input and be able to come up 
with better propositions where then humans   can take those propositions and go through 
something like a div merge process to be able to   come up with better refinements on 
the proposition to move it through   well that's not voting but it's achieving the goal 
of voting is better than it it's and uh what about   the kind of attention hijacking tech that facebook 
or youtube have where you think you're just gonna   check for a second and then an hour went by well 
it's taking unbelievable personalized data about   your behavior building behavioral models and 
then being able to use that ability to control   [3419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3419.92s)

your behavior what if instead of maximizing time 
on site because they have an advertising model   they were maximizing your rate of learning and 
development they had a pedagogical orientation well that would be different right what about if why do we not have boating in person everywhere 
we can see taiwan made the shift right we can   see a few places are starting to work on it well 
if you can do your banking online with public key   crypto of course you can do that online and then 
you don't have to have voting be something that   happens once it every four years or every two 
years it can be a continuous process and where   you don't just vote yes or no on a proposition 
you get to help craft a proposition where you   can see the provenance of information that is 
leading up to it and who's influencing it maybe   you can even do things like a qualified democracy 
where before you get a vote on a proposition you   [3466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3466.48s)

simply take a simple test that shows that you 
understand the pros and cons as generally stated   not leaning one way or the other so that you 
can't just get populist people that are coming   and voting without understanding it and that if 
you don't want to do what it takes to learn that   thing you can use [[liquid democracy]] to give your 
vote to someone who does understand it right so   there's a lot of things we can prototype with that 
are like wow that's really different that makes a   whole new set of possibilities what if you start 
getting lots of those together well when you look   at the rate of technological automation both in 
ai and robotics we're about to lose most of the   jobs oh but there's going to be new jobs that 
are competent another not not and there aren't   comparably in the same way this is why so many in 
the billionaire class are fans of ubi is because ubi is arguably the cheapest way to tend to the 
unemployed underclass to keep them from being a   [3522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3522.08s)

problem and so you get a centibillionaire 
class who are the ones that control   the top of the power law distribution within a 
vertical right one of the things that happens   in the new areas of [[exponential tech]] is that 
metcalfe's law leads to natural monopolies and   power law distribution so amazon is bigger than 
all other online markets combined and facebook is   bigger than all other [[social media]] and youtube is 
bigger than all other video players combined and   google bigger than all of the search engines you 
get basically one owner of the whole vertical   right that's not through government monopoly it's 
through the natural monopoly of [[network dynamics]]   when we made anti-trust laws anywhere in 
the world [[network dynamics]] didn't exist yet   in that way so we didn't build that in 
and yet this the essence of antitrust should apply right which means our legal system 
can't begin to keep up with the rate of tech   [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3576.64s)

changing the fundamental premises okay so you 
control one of those verticals of [[exponential tech]]   so you know deca billionaire 
sent to billionaire class   they get to compete with each other coordinate 
with each other for class interests and compete   with each other for who kind of runs the solar 
system and then some increasingly smaller number   of middle class who tends to those people's 
systems and then a much larger underclass   that is just not useful anymore because 
robots and ai are better at most things   so we we give them oculus and 
ubi so they're not a problem   that's a  __  world that's a  __  world 
and that's one of the attractors right now now the same tech can be implemented towards 
very different purposes that make a much higher   quality of life possible but again when you take 
the detect oh so you take that text and emerge so   [3637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3637.04s)

all right well the jobs are going to get automated 
well that sucks if the people need the jobs   well ubi's one way to make the people not 
need the jobs but still with quite low   autonomy and upward mobility and etc but beyond ubi is something like access to 
commonwealth resources actually gets beyond   just individual possession and ownership being 
the only way to have access and being able to   separate the meritocratic stewardship of resources 
from access to quality of life those are things   that are both mediated by dollars right now but 
can easily be separated should be separated well   technological automation automating the easiest 
things to automate are the things that are most   rote the things that are most wrote are the 
things that people like to do the least anyways   so could we direct this tech in a different 
way a not centibillionaire class oriented   [3695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3695.52s)

not a short-term roi but a how do we make a 
beautiful civilization way where we say okay   great so we can automate the shitty jobs awesome 
we used to have to financially incent people to do   those shitty jobs because civilization needed the 
jobs to get done so we made it to where the people   needed the job so the market forced them rather 
than the state forcing them because otherwise we   called it totalitarianism and didn't like it we'd 
rather let the market force well we just changed   one of the underlying bases of capitalist theory 
communist area everything which is you need a   labor force you don't need a labor force you have 
to rethink all of economics from scratch now okay   well now maybe we don't need a system of extrinsic 
incentive to force people to do shitty labor jobs   and you can make a whole education system and an 
[[economic system]] that is oriented towards intrinsic   incentive what is it that what what meaningful 
things could humans do with a life that they   [3746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3746.08s)

would have intrinsic incentive for i don't have 
to extrinsically incent them to do we simply have   to support their capacity to do it so the same 
technologies that are being implemented based on   current easy market opportunity that lead to 
either dystopic worlds or catastrophic worlds   could lead to really beautiful worlds but it's not 
just based on the current easy market opportunity   it's based on designing it's differently aligned 
with long-term civilizational vision and i guess   this is one of the key things as a system that 
is in the process of committing suicide right   a [[self-terminating]] system is not a system you 
should try to win at and dollars are kind of   like the score card of how well you're doing 
at this current world game and so if i have what the market currently incense if i follow that 
i'm not going to build a new system of incentive   if i want to build a new system of incentive 
where that 70 trillion a day of human activity is   [3814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3814.72s)

incented in a different direction how i build that 
new thing is not going to be what's incentivized   by the current thing so it's going to be some 
people who make an evolution in their values   first who are willing to build new technologies 
in new ways social and [[physical tech|physical technologies]]   together in new ways that create new systems 
of incentives that make it easier for other   people to onboard into those values but the 
the beginning of a new civilization is always   not winning at the previous one it is always 
willing to fight a revolutionary war to take   some real sacrifice to migrate to something 
because something matters enough that it's   worth not continuing to just try to 
be secure or win at the existing one   and this shift and in um [[sensemaking]] is the 
goal of the convenience project i didn't even do   consensus project sorry um thank you for bringing 
me back the goal of the consultants project is to   [3878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=3878.4s)

help this zeitgeist that the one thing that 
civilization needs to be centrally focused on   is the development of new [[social tech|social technologies]] that 
both employ and direct [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] the   goal is to not only get that zeitgeist out 
there but to get enough understanding about   what those new systems must be that the design 
criteria for decentralized innovation can happen   so you know we're writing a bunch of articles 
we have a we have a research team of people that   have been thinking about these things in novel 
ways for a long time from different disciplines   we're growing that team if people have 
the right kinds of background and insights   and so what we're writing is 
where people can understand   take any [[social system]] take the [[fourth estate]] 
take education take law take economics governance   [[fourth estate]] media if you're gonna have 
something like a democracy or a republic   anywhere where there's participatory 
governance the people have to know   what's going on to be able to vote and to be 
able to be civically engaged so you need some   uninvested way of giving everyone the [[sensemaking]] 
well obviously those systems were built with print   as the mechanism and we can see that the world has 
evolved into a way where they've all been captured   by vested interests economic and political 
interests and then attention optimizing uh   [[social media]] technologies that 
deliver it to people micro target   the things that appeal to their biases 
the most they're in group by a system   so without a good [[fourth estate]] you cannot have 
[[participatory governance]] you need to be ruled   but the type of [[fourth estate]] that has ever been 
possible before is not possible in a post-facebook   world so what are the criteria for a [[fourth estate]] 
that is adequate where people for an information   commons and an [[epistemic commons]] that is adequate 
that people can participate in collective choice   making because they have good enough collective 
[[sensemaking]] what how do we do that in a   post-digital world so we have a series of articles 
we're building that help people understand what   any civilization that wants that participatory 
governance needs in terms of an epidemic commons   why the technologies that have emerged have 
broke the previous answers completely and   forever and we can't go back to them and what 
the criteria of the new solutions must look like   now exactly how to build it we're not saying 
because there's different ways but what we're   saying is these are the criteria that 
it must be so now if you want to build   a [[blockchain]] organization or you are a nation 
state and want to try to innovate as a nation   state or whatever it is great like work on these 
things same with education what we can show how   [4041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4041.76s)

emerging tech has destroyed the previous system 
of education and obsoleted it and then say what is   education in a post technological automation post 
ai post information singularity world well must be   these things right so our goal is to basically get 
the curriculum or the metacurriculum it could be   it could be translated to different pedagogical 
levels but the key insights of the metacurriculum   that is needed for people to be engaged in 
the design of the future of civilization   right to get that out there and then to get it 
translated to where at least for most people   won't be actively in designing these systems some 
will but they will at least be calling for them   so the people who are building them will be 
able to have support whether it's political   support economic support social support whatever 
so we're writing these articles and then trying to   translate the info and the articles through things 
like this through podcasts and conversations that   [4102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4102.08s)

are able to translate them and where people who 
do understand them will be able to translate the   message to their audiences and so you start to 
get a decentralized zeitgeist of people caring   about uh what we think is um valuable for people 
to care about so as to be directing innovation brilliant so building metacurricular curricula 
for various disciplines around the world   um ken wilbur of which i'm a fan has experienced more than 60 disciplines you know that 
adopted the integral model and so it's a it's a   long journey uh for you will there there be a meta 
curriculum for investing and or entrepreneurship   can what what is your plan so let's say people start thinking about all 
right well what are the risks associated with   these various areas of exponential 
tech what would it take to bind that   [4173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4173.84s)

can if i'm as if i'm a government agency i can 
think about what state capacities do we have to do   that or could we make i'm a non-profit i can think 
about that i'm a business i can think about or   what kind of business could we build we can also 
do things that are more creative than business as   we've understood it things like a decentralized 
autonomous organization in the crypto space um so all of those are different ways of trying 
to organize people and steward resource   to build something so you know if we look at the gates foundation 
there was basically a kind of world view that   informed a philanthropic hypothesis and it was the 
like let's apply business metrics kind of business   analytic metrics to philanthropy i would say that 
what we're talking about would make a basis for   new philanthropy which is let's donate money to 
the projects that are working on building the   [4233](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4233.84s)

new institutions necessary the new civilization 
systems necessary um because again otherwise the   billion dollars that we donate going against 70 
trillion dollars a day it's not going to matter   that much so how do we actually build new systems 
that can scale to the thing that needs to happen   in the same way that that could be the basis 
of a philanthropic uh hypothesis it could also   be the basis of a return hypothesis it says 
okay if we're not trying to maximize returns   in the short term no matter how nasty the 
thing is but we're trying to create returns while and through having that capital support 
the most meaningful things that it could   and what we're pointing out is a basis 
of criteria for assessing what meaningful   things are is this good design is it 
actually moving in the right direction   yeah absolutely i hope for that to 
become the basis of investment hypothesis [4301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4301.76s)

and i mean even just listening to this someone 
can start to think about oh you have a piece of   technology that harvests people's individual data 
and does personal micro targeting to be able to   affect their direct their attention that sounds 
like a very profitable business towards what aim   is it going and what are the secondary effects 
oh it's going to be this thing called facebook   it's really for dating and then it'll be like 
for tagging pictures well let's think through it   a little bit how does it pay for itself it's 
going to be an ad model how do you so it's   you sell more ads based on more time on site 
how do you optimize time on site when people   want to get off and do things in the real world 
well through the things that are stickiest so   how do you figure that out when there's a 
huge amount of stuff well we use ai and we   use their data oh so the secondary effect of 
this picture tagging app is going to be that   [4351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4351.36s)

it drives addiction in the entire population 
and doubles down on everyone's bias and limbic   hijacks and destroys democracy in the process 
awesome no i don't want to invest in that um   so well now if you want to change the design 
criteria right they shouldn't have an ad model   people pay for the service and now the service 
they are the customer and so you have a fiduciary   responsibility to them rather than to the 
advertiser and the people of the product now we   can actually do something that's meaningful to the 
people yeah i'll invest in that thing and maybe   it has a longer return cycle awesome long return 
cycles are necessary to do things that aren't evil   um the short term money on money process like it's 
very important to understand that capitalism is   not business it's not the same thing business 
was pre-capitalism business was the idea of   how do i make a good or service that people 
actually want based on real demand and how   [4410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4410.64s)

do i make the best good or service at the 
best value so that a hopefully rational   person will make a good choice and in doing 
so i get more money through production only   of real value at a good at a good value uh in 
which case i'm a good steward of that money   because i'm going to continue to produce real 
value that's kind of like a very brief version of   randian market ideology it's not capitalism uh 
capitalism is once you start doing that and you   have a big pool of capital and you realize that 
compound interest makes money faster and financial   services of various kinds make money faster than 
the good or service because the good or service   has a cost of goods sold and the money doesn't um 
and the money has an exponential return on it the   other thing doesn't have an exponential return 
capitalism is about stewarding pools of capital   to create more capital and you know the saying 
that dumb criminals break laws smart criminals   [4466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4466.8s)

make laws they start to recognize well who makes 
laws lobbyists who pays for them people with money   why do they do it because they can make more money 
if they do the thing and uh what do politicians do   after they stop being politicians well they're 
still economic actors oh great so if i have more   money i can also change law in uh the direction 
of the interest so capitalism works to we can also   create media companies we can also fund certain 
kinds of media we can also fund certain kinds   of research so what people even think is true is 
based on the  __  that actually got funded so   um to increase those pools of capital i can 
pull on the levers of affecting policy affecting   media zeitgeist and style and like that affecting 
even research and the fundamental ideas of   what we think is true can affect all of them 
ultimately to be increasing optionality and power that that is not a system that is meritocratic 
where the more money you have is a sign of the   [4534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4534.08s)

more good you did no it's not that's utter 
gibberish i can make money through production   i can also make money through extraction and as 
behavioral economics showed it's very easy to   compel people to not be rational actors so i can 
make money through producing valuable things where   i can make money through producing addictive 
 __  and stuff that drives fomo that clearly   makes everyone's life worse and given that the 
supply side if it's a million dollar billion   dollar hundred billion dollar organization has 
way more coordinated power than the individual   purchaser does it's an asymmetric war to influence 
them where demand isn't driving supply supplies   manufacturing demand will the intelligent 
the whole base of markets area just broke   as soon as you can manufacture demand the 
idea that it is a [[collective intelligence]]   system is broken it's not a collective 
intelligence system now it's a paperclip   [4585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4585.76s)

maximizer it is now an autopoetic process for 
converting people and the world into capital um why did we go there because you wanted to support our listeners 
investors and entrepreneurs to make better   decisions on where to invest and where to hide 
their capital and their efforts and all of their   resources toward and i'm grateful very grateful 
for that so financial services were kind of the   beginning of the end of market theory actually 
having any real integrity because now i could   not be producing real goods and services but doing 
speculation and market manipulation blah blah blah   and the ability for short-term money on money 
creating so much advantage that we didn't invest   in real things and then you know things in the 
domain of atoms have cost of goods sold whereas in   the domain of virtual dome so i don't get unicorns 
in a year anywhere other than software but   [4648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4648.24s)

whatsapp is not what the world needs to be 
better but all the money is going to flow away   from oh we don't have money for green tech and 
whatever because it flows to the area where you   get exponential returns that are making sure 
the world doesn't need based on manufactured   demand because it's where the return cycles 
happen that  __  has to shift right so um   so can you make a return in the current world with 
the money you have sure doing some good things   but most of the opportunities authentically 
suck like most businesses if they shut down   the world would be better not worse um most 
new businesses that are emerging will cause   more externalities than the 
benefit they cause is worthwhile   most of the ways that people make money 
will cause enough harm to the world that the   philanthropy they do with that money will still 
end their life being net negative to the world   [4699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4699.52s)

if someone wants to claim they're doing impact 
investing just  __  be honest about this   like just don't do it as greenwashing it's evil 
just be just be a capitalist like that's fine like   it's better to be honest about it otherwise if 
you really want to do impact investing what do you   want to impact why like what do you honestly want 
to impact and look at clearly the second order   effects of the things that you're putting it into 
there are some things that are worth investing in   i want way more money going into fusion i want 
way more money going into many areas of energy   technology into manufacturing techniques that get 
to go close loop [[materials economy]] so we can make   all the new stuff from old stuff into the types 
of nanotech and manufacturing that can make that   happen those are longer term return cycles and 
they won't be exponential return cycles in the   same way because they'll have costs of good and 
they'll have r d up front and r d in the domain   [4753](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4753.12s)

of atoms is longer and slower more expensive 
than it is in the domain of software but that's   the  __  the world actually needs and it can 
be profitable it can even be super profitable   because it can solve major world problems 
so larger investments that are longer term   we didn't get railroads with short investments 
like the railroad wasn't worth anything until   it went all the way across the country and so the 
[[industrial revolution]] required long-term planning   how long did notre dame take to build right 
like the the short-term return focus is   fundamentally destructive to life so 
one of the first things i can say is   have a term focus and then in the 
thing that you're investing in   is it solving a critical must solve problem 
for the world and what are the likely second   second-order effects it's causing if it's not 
solving a critical problem and if it generates   [4817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0l56vjTss&t=4817.6s)

second-order effects that are worse than the 
problem it's trying to solve don't invest in it wonderful, daniel it's been a great pleasure 
uh to speak with you again uh i know it's   two o'clock in the morning your time 
so i i want to thank you so much for   your graciousness of time and knowledge and 
information and inspiration and uh thank you   so much for being on the program and we will 
continue i appreciate the education that you're   bringing to people mariana and i was a delight to 
be with you and talk with you today thank you bye
