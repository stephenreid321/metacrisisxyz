daniel schmachternberger’s road to a new
civilization — a critique introduction we are living in a peculiar time. before the modern times, countries, great
empires, and entire civilizations rose and fell. usually when they fell, they left others intact
— they didn’t bring them down as well. but now, the current technologically advancing
global civilization has the capacity of destroying itself, along with all of humanity. [[game b]] is an attempt at figuring out how a
different type of [[social system]] could look like, that would allow for a stable existence
of human civilization. i will present here one particular version
of [[game b]], as envisaged by daniel schmachtenberger. i will also present some of my criticisms
and questions that it needs to answer. because i will focus on one man’s take on
the problem, naturally there will be many things i say that may very well be addressed
by others thinking about [[game b]]. i am not presenting and critiquing [[game b]] in its entirety,
but one perspective on it. other notable thinkers working under the game
b umbrella are jim rutt, bret weinstein, jordan greenhall, forrest landry, and ben goertzel. in my critique i will draw heavily from existing
criticisms of technology, in particular that of ted kaczynski. it’s because schmachtenberger and kaczynski
have a lot in common in their thinking about technology — they rely on [[game theory]] and
[[complex system|complex systems]] theory in their analyses. of course, they depart in major ways, especially
when we’re talking about solutions. i will also use some criticisms by other anti-technology
philosophers: jacques ellul and john zerzan. who is daniel schmachtenberger? daniel was home taught, meaning he was free
to pursue and explore his own interests without being confined in a rigid curriculum. he gained a lot of understanding of complex
systems science that studies the processes of large wholes emerging out of local interactions
between the elements, like ants doing very simple tasks that leads to the entire colony
being able to intelligently respond and adapt to its environment. he is a systems thinker, who analyzes and
understands various domains of the world as [168](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=168.14s)

such interacting systems. he is also a founder at neurohacker collective,
that aims to optimize human cognitive faculties. what is the problem with our civilization? [[game b]] is an attempt at figuring out a solution
to the problem with our current civilization. so what is the problem with our civilization? the symptoms in nature, we find that power is evenly distributed
across the members of a given population. the fastest lion is only a bit better than
the average lion. there are no huge differences. and between the rivalrous groups — say,
lions and gazelles — there are symmetries [216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=216.249s)

of power. gazelles are also very fast. most healthy gazelles can escape a lion attack. sometimes a gazelle runs away, sometimes a
lion gets a kill. by being so close to each other in power level,
they can live alongside each other, constantly exerting pressure for the other to get a bit
better. the lions get better, but only a little, and
only as much as gazelles get better. they keep each other in check. a natural predator can only kill as much prey
as he can eat. and he can’t eat much at once. [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=260.79s)

a predator is not super-powerful compared
to the prey. but we are. we can catch so many fish at once that we
have to count them in tons. we no longer are mere predators. this is because of our use of constantly improving
tools and machines. we’ve broken the symmetry of power. that means that we’re unable to maintain
stability in the environments we live in. with scarce resources and in a rivalrous game
theoretic setting, there are strong incentives to not only withhold information about the
world, but there are also incentives to misinform the other groups about the world. [306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=306.54s)

a system of selective pressures creates such
[[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] to misinform, lie, generally to engage in information warfare to benefit
oneself or one’s group at the expense of the larger community. if someone chooses not to play by those bad
rules, he looses to the ones who do. the ethical ones are simply being replaced
by the less ethical, so it’s better for you not be so virtuous as to remove yourself
from the game. the unethical system convinces the ethical
people to compromise on their ethics to become the tool for the system. the prognosis we have identified the symptoms that ail the
modern world. [354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=354.19s)

what is the prognosis for the patient — for
humanity? the symptoms of the disintegration of our
civilization are intrinsically linked to technology. we constantly make better technology and we
use this technology to make even better technology. with each decade we observe some technological
breakthroughs. and normally that’s ok. we want innovations, new medical procedures,
more computational power, novel forms of communication, more efficient powerhouses. but alongside all that clearly beneficial
tech, we have developments that pose grave danger to the future of entire human civilization. we not only have a few national superpowers
armed with [[nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]], but we’re witnessing the emergence of new kinds of technology. we’re talking about [[exponential tech|exponential technology]]
— the technology that we use to make better forms of technology, that are also easier
to use by smaller groups. that would include genetic engineering with
the possibility of creating deadly viruses, [[artificial intelligence]] aimed at optimizing
for a mundane task but with unforeseen but disastrous consequences, and nanotechnology
that could allow creating miniature weapons. all this points to a bleak picture of the
future where we destroy the environment, making most of the planet unsuitable for us to live
on. in the darkest of scenarios, we eradicate
ourselves altogether, or even most complex life on the planet. [461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=461.86s)

the root cause why don’t we use technology for the benefit
of all, and instead we use it to extract natural resources and ruin the environment? why do we make this technology and why do
we use it in such destructive ways? it’s because when one group starts to use
technology to extract some natural resources, while polluting the environment, this group
gets a major advantage over its competitors. so they now have to do the same or else they
will be out-competed. and after a while we have a situation where
no one can stop, because if they stop, the others will continue to abuse the environment,
and a new group will take their place. so it creates a [[race to the bottom]] where a
short-term gain is beneficial for every such group, but in the long-term their actions
lead to disastrous consequences for everyone. as long as we’re having separate interests,
there are incentives to game the game, whatever it is. economy is a system that predisposes people
to do certain things. it creates extrinsic incentives or motivations. this is done through currency — everything
can be seen as exchangeable and usable. the only things we see and focus on are the
things we can convert into currency. but economy makes it impossible to value or
optimize for many non-exchangeable goods, such as songbirds, nature, personal enjoyment. currency as a metric doesn’t capture many
otherwise valuable goods, goods that are shared [564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=564.62s)

by all of us. when this system acquires [[exponential tech|exponential technology]],
it becomes a [[self-terminating]] one, because it can’t leave the natural resources alone
— they have to be converted into things, measurable by currency. the solution now that we know the state of our global civilization,
the root cause and the prediction based on the current trajectory, we can ask “what
can we do about it?” daniel attempts at giving a fragmentary answer. the answer consists of two general parts. one part is to give constraints that any workable
plan has to meet. [608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=608.56s)

the other is to provide some ideas that can
fit the overall plan. when i’m saying that this is a fragmentary
answer, i don’t mean it in a derogatory way. we simply don’t know enough to provide a
full plan with a step-by-step process, and daniel is perfectly aware of that. the constraints on any potential plan when it comes to the parameters that any viable
program must work under, we immediately see that schmachtenberger focuses almost exclusively
on people and social relations, rather than technology itself. this is in a stark contrast with major philosophers
of technology, such as john zerzan, ted kaczynski, [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=655.37s)

or jacques ellul. there are many problems that can lead us to
the collapse of civilization. various [[existential threat|existential threats]] (ai, [[climate change]],
etc.) are only instances of an underlying category of problems. there is something fundamental that generates
these problems or that creates conditions for such threats to arise. so we must deal with these [[generator function|generator functions]]
rather than specific instances. technologically advanced rivalrous groups
that aim to seek benefits for themselves at the expense of the commons are such generator
functions of [[existential threat|existential threats]]. and because we can’t stop technology, we
have to transform society from rivalrous to [706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=706.089s)

cooperative. so a workable plan has to solve not the mere
manifestations of the problems, but those fundamental principles that give rise to various
problems. the drive for competition is based on us having
separate interests — i can get ahead by winning over you. whenever there are possibilities to succeed
by screwing others, it will keep happening. this has to be changed so that the well-being
of every person is tight to the well-being of others, and the only way to prosper is
by helping others prosper. participating in the system has to be more
advantageous than going against it. ideas for the future [758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=758.68s)

daniel notices that the way we’re doing
social science is essentially broken, because we’re studying societies that get ahead
of others by destroying them through competition. but studying rivalrous [[social system|social systems]] can
only lead us to conclusions that that’s how societies inherently operate. but it doesn’t mean that other [[social system|social systems]]
are impossible, because we don’t have a representative sample of societies. so we conclude that various destructive features
are intrinsic to [[human nature]]. but in fact, they result from cultural conditioning. we could have a social environment, where
people wouldn’t be conditioned for selfishness, but for cooperation for the long-term common
good. [808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=808.05s)

some of such systems are smaller tribes, where
everybody knows, depends on, and cares for everybody else. in such small communities, people can support
each other and hold each other accountable. sustainable advanced civilization would have
to scale this principle, so that everybody cares for everybody else. it doesn’t seem possible to sustain a large
global population of people who would live a high quality of life that people in the
affluent countries enjoy. what’s necessary is depopulation. we’re already seeing rapid lowering of birth
rates in advanced societies. at the time of writing, we have approximately
90-130 countries that are below replacement [856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=856.08s)

rate. what this suggests is that populations of
many countries will go down for some time, and then they will most likely stabilize. various factors influence fertility rate,
such as calories per day, health of the children and child mortality rate, income and wealth,
education — especially for women, access to contraception, abortion, family planning,
integration of women into the labor force, age at first marriage for women. with time, we can expect more countries to
get industrialized, educated, and wealthy. we can expect their populations to also start
going down up to a stable size. this would make it possible for everyone to
enjoy a high quality of life. [907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=907.91s)

with a smaller world population, it would
be possible for everybody to get access to education and stuff. but we can’t just throw stuff away, as it
wastes resources. the idea is to bind produced things in a closed-loop
economy. by that we mean that produced things are given
to people and when they break or are replaced or no longer used, then they are scrapped
and completely recycled into raw materials, so that new things will be made from them. and that should be possible with the ever
advancing green energy. everyone would get access to things, as they
would get a service to use these things and have them fixed and replaced. the critique the analysis of the problems and the causes
of those problems of modern civilization seem very accurate, complex, and nuanced. but how well do they fare? education daniel designs a [[social system]], where the
population would be educated in the “science of government” and other domains that would
allow people to understand interrelated problems in the world and come up with good proposals
for solutions. how plausible is such an educational system? how smart do we have to be to understand how
the government works and be able to meaningfully [998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=998.58s)

participate? what about personal interests and inclinations? some people are interested in arts, some in
engineering, some in sports, some in still other things. are we all able to appreciate the “science
of government” enough to want to track the development of government for our entire lives? these are only some of the questions that
need answering just to say whether jump-starting the process of transitioning to the new civilization
is possible. when do people defect? daniel says that as long as defecting from
the system is more advantageous than participating [1041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1041.949s)

fairly, it will keep happening and some groups
will go against the common good for their own benefit. the implication being that if defecting is
not more advantageous, then it will not happen. but this conclusion doesn’t follow. it could be the case were we all very rational
beings. but we aren’t. sometimes we decide to do something on incomplete
information, because of errors in reasoning, or when we’re swayed by strong emotions,
or by mistakes. groups can still defect from the system, even
when it isn’t ultimately beneficial for them, for such reasons. [1088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1088.03s)

and when these groups have access to exponential
technology, such as ai, biotechnology, nanotechnology, we get back to the starting point, where we
are at great risk of those technologies being catastrophically misused. unpredictability of complex dynamical social
systems ted kaczynski introduced a concept of self-propagating
systems, based on our knowledge of [[game theory]] and [[complex system|complex systems]]. a self-propagating system is any system that
can maintain itself and preserve itself, such as an organism, an institution, a corporation. it seems that in any institution a self-propagating
system can arise that has goals not aligned with the goals of the containing system. [1137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1137.53s)

a collection of such systems functions in
similar ways to how species interact through evolution. these self-propagating systems grow larger
and larger. the ones that do not grow are out-competed
by the ones that do. such a system looks for and exploits every
opportunity to gain more power. if it doesn’t, it’s being replaced by
those that do. focusing on short-term gains, even at the
cost of long-term adverse effects, gives the system major advantages over the competition. this is enough to grow larger than those other
ones. these points lead us to a conclusion that
self-propagating systems will grow larger [1184](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1184.15s)

and larger and will be more and more ferocious
with their use of natural resources, ignoring long-term consequences. ultimately, the result will be the total collapse
of the world, making it unsuitable for complex life. daniel schmachtenberger disagrees that this
is inevitable. according to him, it is possible to design
a [[social system]], where there would be no incentives for short-term gains or that short-term gains
would not be greater than focusing on long-term stability and ecology. but can this be actually true? because socio-economical global civilization
is a [[complex system]] of [[complex system|complex systems]], it’s more plausible to think that there will always
be various loopholes and backdoors we couldn’t account for, such that they can and will be
exploited by greedy self-propagating systems for gaining power at the cost of the common
long-term health of the entire humanity. it’s difficult to believe that a system
without those problems is possible. if it is, i think we would need a much stronger,
formalized argument to show that this is indeed possible. this is connected with another point kaczynski
makes. [[complex system|complex systems]], such as a society, climate,
ecosystem, are systems of interconnected elements. they behave in a nonlinear fashion, that is
an increase in some parameter (e.g. temperature) may lead to disproportionately huge results. [1286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1286.86s)

the characteristics of a [[complex system]] tell
us very little that could help us in guessing what the system will do. we often observe novel behaviors on the scale
of the entire systems — so called emergent behaviors. many [[complex system|complex systems]] function in chaotic ways. this means that their behavior is unpredictable,
even in principle. just a tiny difference in the model of such
a system will lead to completely different results and conclusions. the farther we go into the future with our
predictions, the worse they are. if we can’t predict how the society will
evolve, how can schmachtenberger claim we [1328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1328.179s)

can control its evolution, and how can we
say that certain changes in the society will lead to positive effects in the long run? the problem of unpredictability comes from
yet another angle. for the sake of the argument, let’s assume
that everybody in the [[game b]] society operates according to the rules. everyone aims to maximize well-being for everybody
else. still, we can’t predict the ultimate consequences
of our technological innovations. maybe in the future we will want to combat
diseases using gene drives, and a cure will mix with some virus and will spread rapidly
across the entire population. maybe we will want to modify crops to fare
well in the hotter climate, but the genes [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1377.4s)

will jump to the weeds that will be extremely
difficult to stop leading to a famine. we can’t predict all accidents. that’s why they happen. that’s why they will continue to happen,
even in the best of imaginable societies. and when this society has access to exponential
technology, accidents can be terminal. we’re not good at risk assessment of second-
and third-order effects over the long term. these effects are indirect effects from the
first-order effects. so it’s hard for us to know whether a technology
will be safe and beneficial over the long run. our good intentions are not enough. [1424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1424.35s)

we’re simply not capable of predicting what
the noxious effects of an invention we’ll come across decades into the future. daniel wants to preserve technological advancements. but how is it possible, when we’re simply
blind to its future impact on us and on the environment? competition and [[human nature]] access to things and institutions is not enough. people are not equal in terms of ability. some people necessarily will gain more status
and recognition by virtue of them being better at certain things. [1463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1463.169s)

lots of people will contribute nothing that
will be highly valued. won’t it be a problem for those who would
want to be seen in such a light? if it will be a problem — which is more
than likely — then how will they react? will they stand by or will they do what we
always do, pillage and conquer? competition seems to be ingrained into our
minds. we compete for status, power, resources, mates,
and even for our lives. we explain this phenomenon by referring to
evolutionary pressures that molded our minds in such a way. just as we are afraid of snakes, or crave
salty and fatty foods, we have strong tendencies for competition. [1511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1511.76s)

we contest to show our value and to secure
access to resources and mates. that’s why we have some complex emotions
and associated concepts for justice and fairness, jealousy, sense of being at a certain level
on the social hierarchy, positive emotions involved in the recognition of winning and
negative emotions involved in defeat. these emotions lead to various problems, and
they may even drive our use of dangerous technology. daniel argues that we can, in fact, overcome
these impulses. he says that the idea that we’re inherently
competitive is mistaken, because it’s based on looking at competitive cultures and the
other cultures are now long gone. when we look at other primates, we very often
see hierarchies and competition. the most famous example is our closest relative
— chimpanzees, who patrol their territory [1569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1569.87s)

and violently genocide other bands out of
existence. on the other side of the spectrum are bonobo,
also called pygmy chimpanzees, who seem to be much more egalitarian and non-violent. which are we? and can our nature be changed and controlled? we’re more sexually dimorphic than bonobo,
which tells us that most likely our species is, in fact, one where males physically compete
between each other, while females may compete between each other in other ways. this is a pattern that’s consistent across
a variety of species. if the drive for competition is as deeply
rooted in our biological endowment as seeking [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1618.28s)

mates, securing shelter, making tools, then
it may be extremely difficult to contain it and maintain long-term stability. so far, daniel hasn’t made a convincing
argument that this is even possible, an argument that would take into account biology, anthropology,
and our psychology. daniel said that for the competition to be
present there has to be a single metric on which to measure success or position, but
in the new society there wouldn’t be a single metric, as anyone could do their own thing
and pursue achievements there. but we already live in such a world with a
multitude of metrics or hierarchies. in each sport you have a different metric,
in each branch of science you have a different hierarchy of scholars, each branch of the
industry competes mostly within the branch. [1674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1674.75s)

photographers compete with other photographers,
drummers compete with other drummers. we have loads of disciplines with their own
metrics and hierarchies. competition is going on strong and is fierce
in any of them. so it’s plausible that in the new society
people would also like to compete with the peers that are in the same general domain
or are doing something at least similar. so far, i haven’t seen a counterargument
to that. a related point to that of our drive for competition
and status is daniel’s comment on the plasticity of our nature. our species has been selected for memetics. essential to [[human nature]] is the depth of
nurture capacities — we are extremely adaptive beings, we learn to adapt to all our environments
— we learn the language, the tools, how to operate efficiently in an environment. because of our extended neoteny, we have unparalleled
space for teaching our young. that’s why [[human nature]] can be conditioned
for the extremes — from the jains who don’t hurt insects to child soldiers. indeed, there are plenty of examples where
people conform to and are shaped by the circumstances. lots of germans during world war 2 worked
in concentration camps. some buddhist monks devote their entire lives
to meditation and scholarly work, supposedly being able to extend kindness to all living
creatures. yet, these examples don’t show us those
people who didn’t go along with the rest. [1779](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1779.929s)

how many germans didn’t take part or ran
away? how many people failed at becoming monks? the problem is, we don’t know whether it’s
possible to nurture all people so that they fit well into a given system, and we don’t
know whether this will be stable for many generations. as steven pinker argued in his book the blank
slate: the modern denial of [[human nature]], we’re endowed with many tendencies, predilections,
and traits. we’re not blank slates that can be simply
painted on by even the best [[social system]]. daniel needs to make a strong argument that
it is possible to have a teaching system that would work for the vast majority of people
and would be stable. [1830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1830.83s)

and if it wouldn’t work for all people,
then we need to know what to do with the rest. cherry-picked examples are not replacements
for arguments. since the early days of psychology we had
ideas about traits and drives that pertain to competitiveness, going back to freud’s
libido and jung’s archetypes. but going even further back to ancient traditions
we see people talking about “sinful” nature of people or about yin and yang or about spirits
that make us do bad things. these are all very crude ways of understanding
ourselves. but they were good enough in that they pointed
toward the complex and not very pretty nature of homo sapiens. what every culture recognized is that people
have the capacity to do great harm, to destroy, [1886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1886.169s)

in short — to do evil. if you want to go against this, well, all
the power to you, but you need to make a very good case that the plasticity of [[human nature]]
is more than just wishful thinking or a look at [[human nature]] through pink glasses. we all know about group related biases. we tend to favor the group we’re in, and
we tend to be more negative toward those who are not in our group. we might try to think of these biases only
as due to us living in particular types of societies. but there is a second possibility. [1932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1932.48s)

these tendencies might have evolved, because
they helped our ancestors survive. our close relatives — chimpanzees — live
in small groups. males do border patrols of their territory
in small bands. when they catch someone from another group,
they brutally kill them; no mercy. our close extinct relative — neanderthal
— also aggressed on other groups. we have evidence of neanderthals killing children
and eating out their brains using a rock. it’s not difficult to believe that such
violent tendencies are a part of our strongly competitive nature. what this points to is the idea of evolutionary
adaptations for war. this trend in evolutionary psychology is getting
more and more traction since at least late [1981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=1981.07s)

1980s. if we indeed have adaptations and tendencies
for inter-group conflict and even warfare, then it might be very difficult designing
a [[social system]] that would not trip the evolutionary wire that would fire off a large scale aggression. the only point i’m trying to make here is
that we cannot simply brush this off. it has to be explicitly taken into account
in the design of the society, if it is to stand any chance. interaction with other societies daniel imagines that one group of people will
jump-start a successful [[game b]] society, which will grow and attract others to join. [2028](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2028.651s)

he thinks that, because this new society will
give away their solutions for free to everybody else, they would be safe. no one would be incentivized to attack them,
the argument goes. but this is based on a premise that is false. the argument is based on the premise that
power struggles, fights, and wars are driven by rational thought. yes, it would be rational not to attack the
new society to continue to get new innovations from them. but this is not how humans work. human societies attack others because they’re
scared, they don’t want to lose their position; [2066](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2066.97s)

they want to show others they’re not to
be messed with, and for a myriad of other irrational reasons. just because it’s in everybody’s interest
not to attack the new society, it doesn’t guarantee that it will not happen! even today, countries don’t adopt better
solutions from other countries. the most known example is usa not even having
national health care and paid leave/vacation. another is north korea who would fare much
better if it adopted the model of south korea. how can we expect that in the future worse
countries would adopt the way of the better countries? we can expect a growing number of [[game b]] societies,
but most of the world will go on with their business as usual. in the worst case, [[game b]] societies will be
crushed by the more powerful ones. various the new system will have many inefficiencies. we make errors. machines break. pipes burst. materials spill over and get to underground
rivers. the closed-loop will have leaks. the destruction of the environment will continue. [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2145.07s)

the waste and degradation will be slower of
course, but will stay with us even in the new social order. in a system where everyone would be provided
with food and access to things, even if most people would likely continue to work for satisfaction
and progress, there would be many free riders. they would only consume and use the things,
but not contribute much, if at all. this could generate animosities and conflicts
between the free riders and the producers. it’s just one example, when groups of people
would defect from the system, even though it would lead to them being worse off. this can happen for a variety of reasons,
biological, medical, psychological. and it can happen even in a society with a
stellar education system. [2194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2194.68s)

so how would the defectors be dealt with by
the society? will the society be resilient to the presence
of the mistaken defectors? everyone would get access to things, as they
would get a service to use these things and have them fixed and replaced. that means that people wouldn’t own them. will people be willing to relinquish private
property? will people be willing to abandon their sentimental
and unique items? there are plenty of things that just cannot
be mass produced, such as works of art, or things that were used by some important person. these cannot be copied, but they are highly
valued. [2240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2240.69s)

we want such things today, we will want them
in the future. how can a closed-loop production economic
system accommodate this? there are plenty of hierarchies in our world. lots of those hierarchies are constructed
by amassing power and access to resources. it’s very likely that we do it to signal
our value to potential mates. the more resources a person has, the more
chances will their offspring have for a biologically successful life. the more resources a person has, the more
likely they have valuable genes. but in the [[game b]] world order there is no
place for such hierarchies, no place for signaling genetic value by conspicuous consumption. [2289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2289.1s)

this means that romantic and sexual relationships
will also be affected. so how would relationships look like in the
new society? will the alternative model be accepted by
a sufficiently large number of people? if not, what then? anti-tech philosophy daniel takes it as a given that we cannot
stop technological progress, that’s why we have to change our social dynamics. anti-tech philosophers would disagree. they would say that not only we can stop technology,
but we should do it at all costs. this is especially clear in kaczynski’s
anti-tech revolution: why and how. [2330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2330.89s)

even the title tells you a lot! kaczynski lays out his understanding of technology
and argues that we need a radical movement with a singular goal — to destroy global
industrial civilization, as that’s the only way to save complex life on earth. he presses this point strongly and outlines
how it could be done. it’s not clear why schmachtenberger thinks
this is impossible. he may have some good reasons, and it would
be great to hear them. but for now, this sentiment seems unjustified. some anti-tech philosophers, including kaczynski,
zerzan, and ellul believe that technology has very negative impact on us, and this is
intrinsic to technology, as it mechanizes [2377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2377.23s)

everything converting us to rule-following
parts, who can’t genuinely engage with the world and with our lives. schmachtenberger would do well to respond
to such critiques of technology to make his case deeper and stronger. and we would see how tight his case is. countering these anti-tech positions is necessary
to fend off criticisms of his ideas about the technological future of humanity. some anti-tech thinkers believe that the technology
itself is the source of [[existential risk|existential risks]] and that it should be abandoned. ted kaczynski even postulated a plan to establish
an anti-tech movement whose only goal would [2421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2421.8s)

be to damage the industrial civilization so
that it would be unrecoverable. according to him, this is the only chance
of preserving the continuation of life on earth. we may now ask daniel schmachtenberger, why
is it better to devote our resources to the dangerous plan at rearranging our entire society
rather than go with the recommendations of anti-tech philosophers? ethics daniel’s work on starting the trend towards
a new type of society seems to be based on a naïve ethics. by that, i don’t mean that it’s entirely
nonsensical. [2463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2463.52s)

what i mean is that the ethics that underlies
his enterprise can be characterized by two statements: first, his ethics seems to be
fairly reasonable and possibly acceptable for most people, without many controversial
positions; and second, his ethics wasn’t sufficiently explored or argued for. and this characteristic is shared even by
many anti-tech philosophers, climate activists, environmentalists, etc. this is clearly seen, when daniel says that
because technology poses an [[existential risk]], we have to do something about, we have to
solve the problem. on the face of it, it looks like an uncontroversial
statement. but it’s also somewhat naïve, because we
never hear daniel say why should we solve [2514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2514.45s)

this problem. if technology indeed poses a grave risk, and
someday it’ll lead to the disappearance of our species, what then? who will cry after us? will the trees be negatively affected by that? will the bees be worse off? will the animals in the wild miss us? no. there will not be a single individual feeling
a loss after homo sapiens is gone. so why would our extinction be bad? [2546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2546.17s)

for whom it would be bad? antinatalist philosophers make a case that
leads us to a conclusion that the disappearance of humanity wouldn’t be bad after all! some even say it would be a good thing! the fundamental philosophical question that
all [[game b]] thinkers, including daniel schmachtenberger, but also anti-tech philosophers, environmentalists,
and climate activists have to engage with and provide an answer to is this: why prolong
the existence of homo sapiens? wouldn’t it be just fine if we simply went
extinct just a bit sooner rather than later? conclusion daniel schmachtenberger identified a fundamental
problem with our civilization — rivalrous [2591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2591.86s)

groups armed with exponentially progressing
technology strive to benefit themselves at the expense of others, which should lead to
the collapse of civilization. the solution? reshape the social reality to bind well-being
of people so that a success of anyone benefits everyone. there are numerous problems with this version
of [[game b]]. people defect from systems for irrational reasons, even when playing with
the rules would benefit them. the progress of technology and society cannot
be predicted, and hence it cannot be controlled. we seem to have a natural instinct for competition,
we see it everywhere — in politics, in sports, in arts, in cuisine. [2642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQHtaRXntQ&t=2642.6s)

we have no reason to believe that it’s possible
to get rid of it to form a new type of a society. various thinkers point to technology itself
as the source of the problems, not just how we use it. and finally, the apocalyptic predictions are
such only because of unstated assumption that it would somehow be bad for homo sapiens to
go extinct. an assumption that, upon closer inspection,
is naïve and unjustified.
