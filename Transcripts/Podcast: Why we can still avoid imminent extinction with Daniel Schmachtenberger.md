music foreign erger thank you for being with us thanks for having me so you're a philosopher founding member of the consilience project the goal of this conversation today is to analyze the direction of civilization is taking in half an hour because uh you've been doing like so many great podcasts about the [[metacrisis]] during lasting three to four hours and i suggest that people go and watch them on on internet they're very good we'll start with the harvest of the day the question i'm asking to all the guests here for harvard podcast if something easy or simple could be done and will make the world a better place what would it be for you daniel when i saw the note that you sent me that that [51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=51.6s)

would be a last question is there a simple or easy thing that everyone could do that make the world a better place i kind of cringed because i usually really i'm not a fan of that question because the world needs so many different kinds of things done that require different skills and capacities and orientations and to try to reduce it to some thing that would be true for everybody you get [72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=72.42s)

a platitude like be kind or loving or something like that or you get something like recycle or pick up trash or try to use less carbon or something that doesn't map to the whole set of things that the world needs i think there's a process where movements have been associated with political processes and [92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=92.1s)

markets in a way that it's like here's this great catastrophe that'll happen if the other side gets elected so everybody needs to get out and vote for so and so and that's like everybody can do a simple thing because we're relating to everybody as voters um or everybody donate to this cause or boycott this thing but the complexity of the world's issues from climate issues [115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=115.86s)

to ai risk to [[supply chain]] issues to electrical grid issues like there's no action like that there's no somebody to vote for or not to vote for or thing to donate to that addresses it one thing that is not necessarily easy but is relatively simple it would be great if everybody in the world could do more is to seek to try to understand other people's perspectives [140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=140.7s)

much more deeply particularly those that are most different than their own uh if you can try to take the opposite perspective on abortion on gun control on [[climate change]] on the ukraine russian war on the chinese versus western system on any of those things on the israel-palestine issue if you can try to earnestly be able to make the argument that the [169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=169.5s)

person on the other side would make as well enough that they don't have anything to add to it and not just as a rhetorical process but connect to the values that they care about and what it feels like to be them and say the world through their eyes realizing that there might be distortion there might be a lot of things missing but there's not zero truth or zero value to it that process [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=189.12s)

if everyone did that would actually result in addressing the [[metacrisis]] in all of its complexity the issues in synthetic biology risk and pandemics and escalation pathways to warfare and economic issues and geopolitical issues and all of them because you can kind of say that they either come down to conflict or externalities like we cause [213](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=213.239s)

harm directly intentionally which a war is a great example of uh or harm gets caused that we didn't intend to cause so no one intended to cause [[climate change]] we just wanted to have transportation and energy and the secondary you know byproduct of that was [[climate change]] uh all of the environmental issues no one intentionally had a conflict with [237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=237.42s)

the environment that was causing it it was the externality of optimizing something and causing harm somewhere else and so there are problems that we intentionally cause in their problems that we accidentally cause both of them would be corrected by seeking to understand all the perspectives more because if you [252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=252.78s)

sought to understand the perspectives well enough [[conflict theory]] would evaporate and most of the mistakes when you're trying to optimize for one thing and you end up causing externalities to something else somebody else saw that and knew that and if you were in wide enough conversations then the thing that you're trying to optimize for that's going to cause harm [272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=272.34s)

somewhere else someone else would have mentioned and said actually let's improve your design or your strategy by factoring this so both the unintentional externalities and the intentional conflict would be resolved through active perspective seeking and then perspective synthesis wonderful um when you look at the history as you said like humans seem to have like a talent for um innovation and progress but also a natural tendency for war and uh chaos um these two tenancies feed each other and make things bigger and bigger so greatness but out of control technologies can cause a huge damage what do you think um should be about should be done about [314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=314.16s)

technologies and do they represent like innovation are a danger for you first thing about technology is that even if we're not talking about a military technology we're talking about technology for some other purpose even if we develop a technology for some non-military purpose it will have a military application or some kind of [333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=333.539s)

conflict oriented application that basically saying all technology is dual use so maybe we're doing the synthetic biology gene editing for trying to cure cancer but as we get better at making tools to do gene editing can that be used for [[bioweapon|bioweapons]] totally um maybe we're making the ai to try to do drug discovery but can that same ai do autonomous drones and [355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=355.979s)

of course you can whatever purpose we're developing technology for we're also making that technology cheaper and easier for all other types of purposes simultaneously and that's a huge thing we have to factor from a conflict point of view obviously uh people with stone age technology can't cause a war that blows the world up and people with bronze age technology [380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=380.28s)

can cause a war that blows the world up the the harm is proportional to the amount of tech so as we move into exponentially more powerful tech we can't continue to use it with the types of conflict orientation in responsibility we used previous tech the other thing is that even when we're not using tech for intentionally conflict-oriented purposes all of the [402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=402.319s)

tech we use does externalize harm in different ways so you know whether we're talking about agricultural technology where the nitrogen fertilizer have had a lot of people but also causes all the [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean and soil erosion and biodiversity loss um exponentially more technology also means exponentially more externalities and so we can't handle exponential war [424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=424.46s)

and we can't handle exponential externalities so we have to change our relationship with technology really fundamentally and say no other animal have the ability to destroy the biosphere that it depends upon we now do we did not for all of human history so we didn't have to really wrestle with that power we did kill and enslave in genocide and every previous [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=447.419s)

civilization doesn't still exist because they all ended up collapsing mostly for reasons that were largely self-induced even when wars happened often times a war that overtook a civilization was from an enemy that was uh less powerful than ones that they had vanquished in their prime they had already went through some internal institutional decay from infighting and [468](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=468.24s)

things like that many early civilizations died from environmentally induced causes they cut down all the trees they overstripped the soil of nutrients so civilizational breakdown is actually the norm it's just never been at a global level now we don't live in the united states or china we live in a place where the cell phone that we're watching this on or the computer were [492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=492.419s)

watching it on took six continent [[supply chain|supply chains]] to make communicating via satellites and so we live in a kind of global civilization where none of the countries are actually autonomous for fundamental things that they need now that we do have the ability to destroy the biosphere either very rapidly through exponential [513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=513.659s)

technology like synthetic biology or ai or warfare or kind of slowly through the limits of growth environmental issues but that's not all that slow if you have the power to destroy the nature that you depend upon you have to consciously steward it or you'll self-terminate so the gist is we don't have evolutionary capacities we have trans [538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=538.94s)

evolutionary capacities meaning but the difference yeah yeah so and i'm meaning evolution in a biologic evolution sense so another animal has the capacities that it has corporeally built into its body based on its genes so a predator can't become radically more predatory quickly it is only through genetic mutation that maybe it becomes [564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=564.42s)

slightly faster or has slightly bigger teeth and then it's going to be a relatively small change and then there will be co-selection the slightly more effective predator will eat the slightly slower praise which means that the faster prey genes and breed and you get this kind of co-selective process okay we through our ability to build tools and then tools on tools right recursive [584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=584.279s)

abstraction if you look at a true [[apex predator]] you look at an orca in the ocean an orca maybe can catch one fish at a time one tune at a time then you look at a trawling boat that has a mile long drift net that can pull up a hundred thousand fish at once we're not [[apex predator|apex predators]] right like it's wrong to think of us as [[apex predator|apex predators]] we have uh power that is not encoded in our [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=609.0s)

bodies extra corporeal technological capacity you look at a nuclear bomb explosion versus a pissed off polar bear they're not similar levels of destructive capacity yeah um so since we have beyond evolutionary capacity we actually have to have beyond evolutionary motive to guide that capacity and if you want to say that mythopoetically it's if you have the power of gods and by gods here like i mean little g right i mean mythical meaning you can make species extinct you can destroy ecosystems you can create an anthropocene where the largest effect on the geology of the planet is human activity you can genetically engineer [648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=648.959s)

new species right that's much closer to the power of gods than it is the power of an [[apex predator]] if you don't also have the love and wisdom of gods and prudence of gods to guide it it doesn't go well and so uh you know that is just another way of saying if you have recursive abstraction on tools that gives us and tools and coordination they [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=671.399s)

give us the radically more than evolutionary capacity to affect the world we have to move into trans evolutionary motive which means the same recursive abstraction that we're doing right now saying oh yeah i guess it makes sense that we can't run an exponential financial system that's attached to a linear [[materials economy]] that takes stuff out of nature faster than it can be replenished and turns it into trash and pollution in nature faster than it can be processed you can't do that exponentially forever on a finite planet so we have to do something fundamentally different which means you can't orient towards continued maximized growth and maximized conflict orientation forever so that's what i mean by a trans evolutionary motive okay [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=712.56s)

is it naive to think um that we need a global government and we can make a [[global governance]] when you look at the problem of countries having competitive dynamics with each other where nobody wants to price carbon properly because if they do their own economy will be so damaged relative to whoever doesn't they the radically decreased [738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=738.54s)

geopolitical power will express itself as less military power less trade power and particularly with whoever is at the leading edge of guiding the [[world system]] this classic you know the us isn't going to if china doesn't and vice versa and um so then everyone is mostly actually just in a an economics race that is also bound to a an actual [[arms race]] and so and that's true for pricing carbon and [[climate change]] it's also true for fishing of the oceans and aerosols and on and on and on so if you have an issue like the atmosphere right it aerosols in the atmosphere and ozone layer or you have an issue like the oceans or [[climate change]] no country can solve that problem and any country that does the thing that is doing its share [786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=786.42s)

that is economically disadvantaged in the short term by doing it it just isn't going to do that if everyone else doesn't because they are caught in the competitive dynamics yeah so when you look at that you're like all right well we need global government because we have global issues we don't just have national issues and you have to have governance at the level that you have [804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=804.779s)

issues but then of course most thinking people aren't really a big fan of the idea of global government because it's not a great idea to have unchecked power though we don't have a good history of being good stewards of unchecked power and so like you know in many modern governments in the united states it was kind of like the foundation of the whole [825](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=825.959s)

idea was let's separate church and state let's separate the judicial branch and the legislative branch and the executive branch let's even separate the legislative branches into separate houses let's select let's try to create as much check and balance on power as possible so if you had a one world government that had enough power to be able to price carbon properly and enforce fishing laws and etc how do you prevent it from becoming corrupted or captured and so we need global government and we don't want global government and so this is this like you you have catastrophes on one hand that need to be avoided and that typically looks like more control mechanisms of things that if you don't [866](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=866.1s)

control will lead to catastrophe and the control mechanisms typically lead to dystopias and so we want something that is not catastrophes or dystopias we kind of call this the [[third attractor]] and that means you have to have control mechanisms that prevent catastrophes but you have to have checks and balances on the power within those how do you do that so [[global governance]] and global government men turn on the same thing right global government the idea that there's some centralized global monopoly of violence the bad idea okay the idea that there is some more effective process of global coordination even whether it's a more effective process of nations engaging in multilateral agreements they can be facilitated by technology that can make uh the [908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=908.1s)

participation or violation of those agreements more transparent or you know there is some process of [[global governance]] that has to occur where there's both effective power for enforcement this is why you know we can solve those types of coordination problems to some degree those [[race to the bottom]] within a country where you have a monopoly of [930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=930.72s)

violence because the law and monopoly violence just basically says no you're not allowed to cut down any of those trees that's a national park and if you try the police will stop you and they have more capacity for violence than you do with international issues where you don't actually have international enforcement it's really really tricky so for all of the really global issues and [948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=948.779s)

that looks like it's in each nation's interests to burn the coal as fast as it can and the oil that's in each nation's interest to win the ai [[arms race]] even though that increases the likelihood that we all die from it in the long term so [[global governance]] that has appropriate checks and balances is a tricky topic but it's a necessary topic [969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=969.54s)

what gives you hope today a lot of things can be hope i have noticed in my own work people in top positions of power and major institutions that affect the world being radically more aware of things that are fundamentally unviable about this [[world system]] and interested in deeper changes and actually starting to try to implement some things just even in the last couple years than i had ever experienced previously so the idea that you know the the kind of behavior that individuals can do on their own matters and the kind of stuff we can do locally like you know prototyping new types of [1018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1018.98s)

communities and new types of cities you don't solve [[climate change]] and time and you don't solve [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] in time and you don't solve ai risk that way right that requires kind of agreement from existing top-down organizations they can't actually innovate a new world they can just stop bad things from happening with the right kinds of [1040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1040.04s)

agreements to innovate a new world actually does require local um and more participatory activity uh but the fact that after covid and after the extreme uh political polarization that uh has happened and after how much of australia burned and then flooded and um you know now with the war in ukraine [1065](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1065.72s)

and i think there was a situation where previously people who were thinking about it and who appreciant realized this [[world system]] is destabilizing and is fundamentally not sustainable most of people who are administrating it didn't think that now almost everybody thinks that and that's actually something that [1086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1086.36s)

gives me hope great how much time do we have to react to avoid extinction well some species go extinct every day as a result of human activity so for them uh were already past [[existential risk]] you know kiev was an incredibly progressive place not very long ago it wouldn't have seemed like a place where eminent [[catastrophic risk]] was uh was coming for many people and um you know that's even true of syria not that long ago and um you see the pictures of what culture was like in 1968 in iran so it's not like how long do we have before catastrophe hits we're already in a rolling global catastrophe like how long does australia have before [1134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1134.78s)

it burns that already happened you know and from extreme weather events that are a result of human induced activity poor environmental management and problems with utility companies and overuse of groundwater and [[climate change]] right and how quickly does war escalate as a result of what's happening in ukraine and larger scale and already what we see in [1157](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1157.1s)

regarding taiwan that azerbaijan and armenia and iran and so many places um these things could move very fast or more slowly in ways that are chaotic and totally unpredictable um when you look at things like the [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] how long until we pass certain [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] you'll hear people talk about [1182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1182.419s)

this thing happens in 2050 and this thing happens and by the end of the century or whatever with [[climate change]] but we've already passed some of the [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] you know there's a study just published in the american chemical society journal saying that um certain toxic chemicals in rainwater kind of ubiquitous around the world are past the epa thresholds for human health [1204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1204.5s)

and this was particularly the the fluorinated surfactants which don't break down right that's why they come forever chemicals but the idea that things that are carcinogens and cause birth defects and are endocrine disruptors in rainwater all around the world are past the levels of human health tolerability it's a huge deal it means even if you go get off-grid as can [1226](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1226.7s)

be and try to live off the land you can't and um and how quickly we're producing those chemicals not only is there a cumulative effect of them because they're persistent but we're also increasing our production of them exponentially and so how long do we have we're already in a situation of a breakdown of a [[world system]] it's already existential for many species it's already catastrophic for people in many areas of the world and so i would reorient the question to be more like is there anything that we can do to have it not be totalizing and the answer is yes and the answer time wise on that is the full life attention of everyone [1275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1275.72s)

as best as possible directed at better understanding the issues and participating in their solutions is what's required in our individual level uh we've become a bit lazy maybe maybe because we think like there is always a solution and we don't really need to act um how to wake up and also how do you get the news because you have like so many news in different directions like [1298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1298.34s)

we don't know who to believe and we don't know like we're not sure we need to act because things always uh have a solution by themselves there's a really interesting book called the politics of the invisible written after chernobyl because after the chernobyl explosion the uranium is invisible right you can't see it with the human eye obviously now covid that's invisible [1321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1321.559s)

and yet totally lethal and well what he was exploring in politics of the invisible is because of modern technology and chemistry we can make things that are totally lethal that we can't see that require people with geiger counters and the ability to do physics that not everyone can do uh to be able to determine safety levels how [1346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1346.28s)

does that work with democracy when most people don't have the capacity to do that so you'll see currently a lot of people doubting [[climate change]] science but nobody can actually the average citizen can't run the ipcc's mathematical models to say they work or they don't work or they um and so people are largely kind of left to faith and you then end up [1365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1365.84s)

getting uh politics driving people to either be kind of pro-institutional or anti-institutional and um and the institutions get things wrong so it's easy to be anti-institutional and neither of the positions are actually viable and there is something other than truth which is the movement to power motivated in both of them i see [1386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1386.9s)

that when people think someone else will come up with a solution they feel kind of unmotivated but also when people think there is no solution they feel unmotivated and this is also something i find really interesting is when i talk to someone who has a really fervent adamant view about whatever it is that whether it's vaccines or [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1410.0s)

masks or what should happen in russia ukraine or abortion law whatever um they go from complete certainty without understanding the position of the other side or all the complexity or nuance well and if i challenge it enough regardless of which side it is and show them the increased complexity okay well if we price carbon that way and china doesn't [1431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1431.0s)

then autocracy ends up running the world so you're voting democracy out whatever it is then for so many people the first response when you increase the show them that the way they're thinking about it doesn't actually map to the complexity of the problem they go from utter certainty to nihilism in one step they're like oh it's too hard it's too complex i give up and to move [1451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1451.88s)

from certainty to nihilism in one step is so damn lazy like cognitively emotionally epistemically lazy and so i want people to go from certainty to like actually i don't understand this all that well actually [[climate change]] or global science or policy on this thing is pretty complex there are experts who spend their whole life working on it who disagree that doesn't mean there aren't [1476](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1476.059s)

solutions but the one that was fed to me that everybody on my political side agrees with and everyone on the other side disagrees with is probably not a fair version of the whole truth so i'm not going to give up because i don't know i'm i'm not going to hold the certainty that i know because i don't i'm going to work to try to understand competently while recognizing i don't [1495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1495.919s)

yet and then even once i get to much deeper understanding i'll still recognize how much stuff i don't know that's relevant and new information that might come in so i want people to be much more epistemically rigorous and epistemically humble at the same time right epistem epistemology meaning how we go about knowing things so i want them to work much harder at trying to [1518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1518.78s)

come to understand well having much less certainty about their current level of understanding so when you ask how do you like what sources should people go to for news or whatever the ones they don't currently go to is the first answer um and then of course progressively better sources not all the sources independent of political spinner are equally good but when you can see where [1539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1539.9s)

do the various earnest experts on a topic disagree and you at least understand those positions pretty well then you start to have a sense of the topic as a philosopher and because you spoke about political do you want to stay away from politics or are you into politics politics meaning how people organize and how they [1563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1563.08s)

coordinate and how they make sense of the world together so they can make choices together no i'm totally focused on that um the current political system and the united states does not do a very good job of helping people collectively make sense of issues well collectively identify all the values that matter that are shared values and then collectively [1588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1588.62s)

make good choices in the presence of the shared [[sensemaking]] and shared values generation so um it's not that i think there is never a time to engage in voting for a particular candidate or on a particular proposition but how to engage in meta politics meaning how to evolve this political system and [[economic system]] right how to evolve the political [1611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1611.48s)

economy along with evolving the infrastructure and tech stack and the culture and [[value system]] simultaneously because all three of those interact each other right the the culture the political economy and the infrastructure and technology they all intereffect each other so you can't change any of them without changing all of them to think through how to what has to happen in all [1630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1630.38s)

of those for a viable world to come about i'm very interested in that okay about you something very interesting i found um you mentioned you were homeschooled by your parents um which qualities uh did your parents manage to let flourish in you that might not have been [1654](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1654.38s)

um so important also in a traditional education when you're changing teachers every year i was homeschooled i did go to school both private and public schools for little bits throughout my life so i have some experience of it but most of my childhood was homeschooled but it was not um traditional homeschooling meaning i [1675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1675.44s)

didn't have the state curriculum and just do it at home my parents were kind of interested in running an educational experiment that uh is a little bit closer to what people call unschooling today but there's just no curriculum it's just okay um what it felt what they felt you need to to learn it's not what they felt [1694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1694.58s)

their hypothesis was um expose the kids to all the different topics see which ones they're interested in facilitate their interest and kind of trust that and so it's aligned with some of the ideas of montessori and constructivism and um but you know in radical lab no curriculum at all but uh and i'm not [1717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1717.919s)

saying that is what i would advise but there's a lot good in that and what qualities that facilitated in me that um most educational systems don't is all of my studies were things i was interested in and so my interest in learning was actually growing all the time right there was never a place where i wanted [1745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1745.159s)

to get out of school and go play or do something else where uh learning felt like a burden or where i ended up not having any negative association with study right i had only positive association with it because i was studying things i wanted to study so um i find that people tend to become good at things they really enjoy and so facilitating like even if you have a [1767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1767.32s)

curriculum really paying attention to where a student's interests are and where their passions are and if there's a topic that isn't appealing to them trying to find a way that actually has it really appeal as a business force them to do the thing makes a huge difference not to their learning of that topic but their relationship to learning [1786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1786.14s)

itself was a special event that puts you in this path of um trying to see the truth what's happening and observe the complexity of the world lots and lots of events i mean some some people have a near-death experience turning point that is really kind of singular at i think most people's life path unfolds from lots of things [1813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1813.679s)

um so as i'm mentioning being homeschooled by parents who are obviously kind of interested in childhood development and the books my parents read to me as bedtime stories were buckminster fuller's design science and fritch off capper systems theory and um you know eastern vedic philosophy and things like that so there were [1833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1833.779s)

um people who are thinking about what is the world how does the world work how do we integrate across the various philosophic and scientific traditions uh how do we improve civilization those were kind of like just the core thoughts that and so i didn't really have to get on that pass um and then a big part of my study as a kid was not just [1857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1857.6s)

studying various areas of philosophy or science or whatever but also being actively engaged in activism my mom was particularly into kind of hands-on activism with uh whether it was helping animals at the local animal shelter or larger kind of [[factory farm]] animal rights issues or environmental issues and so [1877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1877.48s)

being engaged in activism and then seeing what the problems in the world were and then similarly having a system science and kind of design science background to look at it and say how are these problems interconnected what do they have in common as generative dynamics what would it take to address them more comprehensively because it's not that [1896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1896.84s)

hard to see that whether we're talking about issues in health care or issues and war issues and politics or issues in the environment things like perverse economic incentive are one of the drivers of all of them so it's like well how do we think through an [[economic system]] that doesn't have [[perverse incentive]] yeah i would say it was working across many different areas [1915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJJ-mNcmK0&t=1915.799s)

of activism seeing how they related to seeing why the solutions that we were working on weren't adequate because they didn't address the deeper dynamics um those were kind of key early things for me thank you very much danielle yeah thank you thank you music
