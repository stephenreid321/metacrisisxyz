hey guys welcome to future thinkers podcast episode number 43 this is the second half of our interview with daniel schmuck tim berger who is the co-founder of neuro hacker collective and this half we talk about the process of neurogenesis which parts of ancient wisdom are useful in modern society therapeutic use of psychedelics and rites of passage and many other fascinating things for all the links [19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=19.98s)

mentions and books from this episode go to future thinkers or x-43 and to listen to the first half go to future thinkers org slash 42 and if you haven't listened to our other episode with daniel smoked tuna burger in which we talked about the global phase shift we may be going through go to future thinkers at work / 36 and if you're interested in trying qualia the smart drug stack that daniels company has developed go to future thinkers org slash brain hack oh one word before we get into this episode i want to say thank you to our recent patrons and donors christian pablo and richard you guys are awesome thank you for helping us make this show possible alright let's get into it welcome to future thinkers org a podcast [65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=65.299s)

about the evolution of technology society and consciousness i'm mike gilliland and i'm uv ivanova to get notified of new podcasts and videos go to future thinkers org and subscribe to our mailing list you can also find us on itunes stitcher and you tube if you like what we do and you want to help us make more podcasts and videos give us a like or review share it with your friends and consider becoming a patron go to patreon.com/crashcourse org slash bap last but not least if you want to get access to more content hidden episodes or if you just want to chat with us in previous guests then check out our community at community dot future thinkers org music i'd like to go back to neurogenesis and maybe talk again about some of the more specific treatments that support neurogenesis and i'm also wondering is this work mostly being done in in the space of alzheimer√≠s treatment no neurogenesis a fascinating field adult neurogenesis in particular because you know up until not that long ago it was commonly believed that we didn't [137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=137.099s)

generate new neurons after adulthood and that's not true - why neurogenesis is so fascinating we our brain does continuously produce neural stem cells most in the hippocampus that then differentiate into you know other regions of the brain other tissues and that that rate of neural stem cell production can be increased or decreased by a number of [162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=162.58s)

factors so when we think about brain aging and also neurogenesis isn't just for brain aging it's also for dealing with traumatic brain injury and the ability to actually heal areas of brain that were damaged it has to do with increasing gray matter density and just increasing the total information processing capacity of the system also dealing with you know nerve damage [186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=186.07s)

peripheral nerve damage or neuro degeneration research on our team just wrote a meta-analysis of all of the research done on addled neurogenesis and we'll be publishing it soon and it is it's fascinating and our hypothesis from evolutionary biology perspective is that when you think about human genetics and what they selected for more than anything they selected for this is a [211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=211.359s)

generalized but fair way to say it they selected for neurogenesis you know our genes selected for memes right they selected for a creature that could change themselves and their basis for acting over the course of their life significantly in one generation to the next faster than genes could change and so most animals their behavior is pretty genetically hardwired and modulated by [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=238.78s)

the environments a little which is why they actually have the hardwired code to like get up and walk do stuff in the first few minutes of life and we are jnanis and basically useless for so long right for a year and a half we can do hardly anything and it's because we're very soft wired because as tool makers that modify our own environment think about like the [263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=263.2s)

most adaptive person 10,000 years ago at spear-throwing would be useless today because they couldn't text and they couldn't type and they wouldn't know how to call uber and and so it's very important that as we are modifying the environment we can adapt to our new modified environments which means that we are not hardwired that we can be rewiring our innate processes right and [282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=282.91s)

neurogenesis is a major part of that so it's a super fascinating field for disease recovery for anti-aging for understanding [[human nature]] and for kind of hyper learning and capabilities so there's a bunch of things that affect neurogenesis there are these chemicals called neurotransmitters bdnf is the most well understood one brain drive neurotrophic factor ng f for [311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=311.83s)

nerve growth factor so there are things that can increase bdnf increase ngs and normal lifestyle things like exercise is one of the ones that we know better than anything that actually increases neurogenesis weight lifting and hit training in particular more than aerobics are very bdnf up regulating sleep is bdnf up regulating and lack of sleep ins of meaning decrease [338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=338.2s)

neurogenesis there are a number of nutrients that are also involved and there are some herbs and mushrooms that have very very potent effects so you know lion's mane has been used for nerve injury for a long time and it happens to very acutely elevate ngf levels some key nutrients like methylcobalamin methylated coma b12 and taurine in fairly high doses up regulate the [361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=361.84s)

endogenous rate of neurogenesis then there are some drugs that are being developed forward neurogenic purposes and i actually think this is one of the most brilliant things a drug could do you know i said some things that sounded like they were negative regarding pharmaceutical approach as a whole earlier i want to say that some very meaningfully positive things are [384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=384.539s)

happening in all branches of pharmaceuticals largely because other areas especially in complex disease are failing so that what's the cool new areas that are happening is not just a chemical that will try and change the level of something but a drug that will actually support the body's ability to do something better so that i can make this point well think about a statin [407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=407.58s)

right for cholesterol if your cholesterol is high and we give you a statin to lower it we don't know why your cholesterol is high your cholesterol can be high because of diet it can be high because of diabetes like things it can be high because of mold toxicity and so just lowering it doesn't actually address the pathology or the behavior that whatever so that kind of [431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=431.19s)

drug approach is not that interesting and very interestingly sometimes the opposite is what needs to happen so we can you know if your blood pressure's high we give you a drug to just lower your blood pressure all right you just exogenous lis lower blood pressure but why had the body been setting that point too high to begin with if you exercise the reason that exercise lowers blood [450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=450.84s)

pressure is because when you exercise it raises your blood pressure and when the blood pressure spikes even higher it actually kicks in the hormetic mechanisms hormesis is the body's response to stress it kicks in the hormetic mechanism for the body to say oh the blood pressures too high let's bring it down on our own and the body starts regulating blood pressure better [469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=469.71s)

but it actually rather than externally moving it lower what it needed was to be moved higher and then it and its own self-regulation occurred so drugs that just try and move something into range without asking why it happened and without increasing the body's ability to maintain that range not so interesting to me even though i mean they're life-saving they're just not adequate [491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=491.43s)

solutions as we move forward but as we move from like the chemo therapeutic approaches to cancer to amino oncology immuno oncology is the beginning of us doing anything with cancer that's really interesting where we're actually training the body's immune systems capacity to kill cancer cells better that's actually pretty great well in the neural logic space there's a company called neural stem they're working on a drug there and i believe face two clinical trials right now called ns i 189 and it was originally being developed for als but now i believe that the first thing that are trying to improve it for his major depressive disorder but it for als they were originally working with neural stem cells they would grow neural stem [537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=537.24s)

cells and shoot him up into the spinal cord either where there was spinal cord injury or you know degeneration like a als and they were getting some results and they wanted to say well could we increase the body's rate of producing its own neural stem cells so they were growing neural stem cells in vitro and seeing if there were any molecules that would increase their own proliferation [560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=560.64s)

they found some that did an si 189 was the primary one so here it's a drug that isn't trying to modulate an end chain chemical it's actually up regulating your body's own regulatory process and once you have those new neural stem cells they keep doing their thing right they they become tissues and they do their regulatory thing now if you think about if that drug continues to succeed [583](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=583.11s)

and i don't know if it will but there will be a whole class of ones like that it could fix nerve damage from injury nerve damage from neuropathy it could fix retinopathy it could fix ms als parkinson's you know and the reason why i was working in depression was as they were getting up regulated production of new stem cells in the hippocampus and been that starting to affect the [608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=608.54s)

surrounding basal structures the person actually had more information processing capacity to process their emotions and process their experiences and they didn't get overwhelmed you get depressed by them there's a company called zing up they have a website zing up comm and they originally developed friend of mine over there developed a set of processes that they were trying to bring about for [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=634.82s)

helping autism and then what they figured out they ended up applying to just performance enhancement so right now it's a performance enhancement site but they that there were you actually really dig this they were movement patterns that more than other movement patterns radically up regulated neural stem cell production and specifically were growing [659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=659.61s)

gray matter density in the cerebellum hippocampus pond mostly cerebellum wow and that autism was getting better depression was getting better you know they did a study in prisons and violence went down because when people are overwhelmed by the amount of stimulus coming in their emotions etc and they can't process at all then the results of the not processed stuff is lingering [683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=683.28s)

anxiety depression confusion and just being able to process it better physiologically led to you know the healthier happier people and so how they found to do it i think this is a kind of profound insight was when you first start doing a some kind of coordination activity like riding a bike or walking on a slackline or juggling that you've never done at first it seems almost like [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=709.35s)

it's impossible like you can't even find the place where it makes sense that that will be possible because you don't have the neural circuitry to do that particular kind of balanced sensory motor coordination stuff yet and then as soon as you start to get it you're like okay i'm not nowhere near perfect yet but i have the hang like there's this there's something inside of me that [729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=729.87s)

knows how to do this going from the i have no idea how to do this up to getting the hang of it there is a rapid rate of the production of new neural stem cells they're saying whoa we're actually in danger because we can't do this physical activity that's obviously you know needs to happen let's ab regulate our capacity like crazy to be able to do it once you can do it and now [749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=749.37s)

you're just getting better doing it you get a diminishing return on that and so what they figured out to do was how to take people through a series of exercises and they customized them based on assessment but in general anyone could do this a series of exercises it involved coordination and balance and coordinating multiple sensory motor groups that were super difficult and as [771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=771.0s)

soon as you started to get the hang of it they switched into a new one and then as soon as you're sure to get the hang of it they switched and did a new one so you were maximizing for the great the growth rate of neurogenesis which then ended up having in effect on you know all kinds of other things the hypothesis there was that it has to do with automating learning so we learn some you [791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=791.97s)

know we start learning some motor function and it's very hard and we're trying to think about where our hands go and where our feet go and all these things at once and we can't think about that many things consciously so our brain has to try to get some of them in unconscious memory you know and then we can drive a stick-shift without even thinking about it when at first it seems [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=812.97s)

like seven different hard things to coordinate in an [[evolutionary environment]] us moving stuff from conscious to unconscious right conscious consciously we're trying to learn some new skills now we can unconsciously perform it we would have done that for motor tasks more than anything else and cognitive and language etc tests kind of came evolutionarily on top of that so [833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=833.73s)

our capacity to learn new stuff motor tasks are going to be able to drive that evolutionary hardware more specifically those are hypothesis and it seems to be well supported by the evidence and so if you do a bunch of sensory motor tasks that you can't do it all and then you start to be able to do them and you do a bunch of different ones you're actually increasing kind of the neural [858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=858.93s)

infrastructure for the rate of learning and automating conscious - unconscious performance and then that same infrastructure is used when you are learning cognitive tasks or interpersonal skills or anything else so the idea was that it would increase rate of learning and they've got a bunch of research showing that happens to be the case so that's another example of a of a [879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=879.48s)

methodology approach right so you've got drug approaches nutrition approaches exercise approaches methodology approaches for neurogenesis that is fascinating i think that explains in plain terms how yoga works and and how yoga actually supports brain development just through doing a series of different complex movements totally i would say yoga is probably a combination of that [906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=906.51s)

effect that we just mentioned along with stress relieving effects and some of the effects of increased breath both increased breath on parasympathetic function and on oxygen carbon dioxide levels very cool what are some of the other areas that are important to talk about so now to summarize we've talked about the gut brain the emotional regulation we've talked about movement [937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=937.389s)

systems approaches to measuring and understanding what is going on in your body before you're going to go and mess with it what are some other areas of neural hacking that are really important pillar areas we didn't talk about altered states of consciousness yet all right it's waiting for that one so psychedelic assisted psychotherapy psychedelic assisted spirituality [960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=960.75s)

psychedelic assisted neural repat earning super fascinating field and you know even though that field started with you know people like stanislav grof etc back in the day it has been it has been accelerating a lot recently and i'm very happy to see this and i think about the role of psychedelics and the edge ins in human development i think about three kind of distinct categories you can use [991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=991.569s)

it as a [[personal development]] tool you can use as an interpersonal tool and as a transpersonal tool so as a personal tool we can talk about you know it's their role in addiction recovery so you've seen the results of ibogaine and five meo dmt being used along with psychotherapeutic processes for addiction recovery for people on opiates on benzos on all kinds of things and [1019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1019.829s)

it's it's a fascinating field it shares some things with ketamine's approach to depression but you know so you can look at addiction recovery work with ptsd with end-of-life anxiety these are these are areas where it seems to be having an effect that is either more than or different than any other therapies and so very fascinating this is for like you [1047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1047.22s)

know working on pathology for just more kind of psychotherapeutic growth the role that psychedelics can play in shadow work and integrating parts of self is really fascinating when you realize that we don't remember when we're remembering memories we don't remember the memory we remember how its consolidated in our brain factoring all the times we've remembered it and [1072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1072.18s)

changed it that's a big insight because it means that if you can re remember a memory and remember it quite differently you can actually affect how it was stored in all the future times it will be referenced and so say someone is on mdma and so they're in a pretty aforex state and then they think about some negative experience of their past but they can't feel they can't feel negative [1096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1096.96s)

well they think about it so it would always be in the past that they would think about it and feel negative right they have that associative conditioning now they're thinking about it and feeling great so that means that the regions of the brain and the chemistry that's involved in feeling great and that specific thought or co wiring together and then the next time when [1114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1114.81s)

this person is sober and they think about it they remember the last way they remember it and it doesn't have that same charge that it used to have for them this can be about a traumatic memory of the past it can also be thinking about parts of themselves that they're ashamed of or can't love or whatever and instantly like in a fairly short amount of time one or a small [1137](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1137.04s)

number of sessions radically change the charge around psychological topics this is something i've been really interested in in and thinking about and partially why i brought up the whole idea of the gut brain and asking your gut how you feel about something because i'm trying to separate how i feel and what i think about memories and about how i look into the future so this has been an extremely [1162](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1162.45s)

useful tool for me because i separate the memory into its two components and then process the emotions on their own so that i don't have to continue feeling negatively about an event yeah that worked really well you know because you have the memory of just what happened and then you have all the meaning-making around it and the meaning-making can change while you [1185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1185.45s)

still remember the event that happened and when the meaning-making changes the cymatics and the emotions can change accordingly right so you experience some event in childhood and the meaning was something about that you're a failure and you should never try stuff and whatever and when you reprocess and say actually that's not a realistic meaning i was a kid and you know i have actually [1207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1207.95s)

done well of those things later etcetera you can still remember the event but it doesn't have the same associated meaning about self and about reality so then it doesn't have the same charge the fear charge that's trying to protect you from that painful possibility in the future etc you can do that without psychedelics psychedelics just happened to be one very fast way to change that association [1231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1231.29s)

yeah i think psychotherapy is another one and also hypnotherapy because you can induce somebody into trance and then reom print the certain experience so that exactly like you were saying the processing of it changes how your brain processes that so when you talk about hypnotherapy and inducing trance if we're going to try and change the way that someone has stored of memory or [1257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1257.45s)

change their association with a phobia or whatever it is then we want to get them into a state that is amenable to change right psychedelics are a good way of doing this largely because they actually increased neuroplasticity so we talked about neurogenesis developing new neurons but developing new synapses and cleaning old synapses might be even more meaningful which is what in the brain [1283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1283.76s)

interconnects with with what so old synapses that are no longer relevant can get cleaved mostly during deep sleep by microglia and then new synapses get developed it's called synaptogenesis through the learning process so like that zing up example as you go from can't find it at all to find it that's the process of synaptic formation and then healthy synapses that are doing [1306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1306.86s)

something effective get re supported through something called the long term potential process that says yes this is still a good synapse and wanted to keep operating automatically so let's keep strengthening it so one of the things many psychedelics do from a neurophysiologic point of view is increased neuroplasticity that's one of [1326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1326.43s)

our best understandings of one of the things that's happening and that would mean increased ability to actually change neuro structural associations with whatever you do next so if that's the case it would make a lot of sense why when someone has a bad trip it can be so lastingly hard for them and when someone has a really powerful trip it can be so permanently changing for them [1351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1351.21s)

is because what was happening during that time was having more net impact on their brain than is usually capable of happening per unit time right right interesting so psychedelics can do that breathwork right like the holotropic breathwork can create a state of increased susceptibility you can use strobe lights to try and drive specific brainwave [1372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1372.69s)

patterns sleep deprivation creates increased susceptibility which is you know technique military issues and even like some conferences use yeah so i would say in general different forms of psychotherapy are trying to change our information process and change our [[meaning making]] or cymatics or emotion when you start to work on the brain side and the psyche side together [1398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1398.04s)

you can get synergistically compounding effects so think about this this is a fun example if you do psychedelics and then you are in a set or setting that is not appropriate and you end up just freaking out and then you kind of wire that you're unsafe in a dangerous universe that's lame right which is why instead of underlings in matter which is the difference between just tripping and [1428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1428.67s)

actually doing psychedelic assisted psychotherapy or [[personal development]] but if you take psychedelics and so now imagery is very intense well you can do better guided imagery work and you can be in some image so you're going to go back into regression work thing about childhood but when you're visualizing it you can actually visualizing it sensorial and real so it [1448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1448.2s)

actually rewires more powerfully plasticity is increased and you can even do a microdose right a microdose where you're still pretty much sober but plasticity has increased which is why people use microdosing when they're gonna go learn new athletic capabilities or language whatever for you know just rate of learnings of plasticity say to microdose then you do some psychotherapy or eeg neurofeedback or anything that's gonna be changing neural patterns and then afterwards you do things that chemically increase long term potentiation and help lock in those new patterns so that they actually stay that would be like cholinergic and there's a handful of things that support the long term potentiation process but we can just say [1495](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1495.029s)

mostly cholinergic for now that sequence of things is gonna have synergistic value beyond what any of those things have on their own right increased plasticity to change old patterns put in input to change old patterns to new patterns put in chemical inputs and lock in those new healthy adaptive patterns so this is just starting to scratch on what interesting neural hacking can look [1518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1518.19s)

like that is fascinating i mean this kind of multi-tiered approach to psychedelic therapy as opposed to tripping like i said right i wonder how this relates to the shamanic and initiative practices of the past where it was a kind of a multi tiered approach to this profound consciousness change that they were trying to achieve where on one hand you have a shaman that is [1541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1541.289s)

guiding you then on the other hand you have the the herb the psychoactive ingredient that you're taking and then on the other hand you have some sort of stress testing so you have sleep deprivation or physical exertion or facing dangerous environments and then after the person goes through this you have the integration practices where everybody hugs and you know the person [1563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1563.37s)

comes back to the tribe and you kind of have the supportive environment that probably releases some brain chemicals for integrating this experience and retaining it i wonder how we can take this sort of multi tier approach and apply it to modern life with better technology it's the same as you were mentioning with that [1582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1582.77s)

it sounded like yoga had some of the similar properties what i was saying with the zing up neuroscience you know for 250,000 years give or take the same brains as we have now so they've been smart people around for a long time named and as they were paying attention to what worked and didn't work and then being able to pass that information down over a long period of time they figured [1603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1603.799s)

out stuff that worked and so there's certainly some stuff in the ancient traditions where we figured out much better stuff and there's some stuff where their methods are still meaningful and ways where there's nothing in modern life like them and so obviously the integration of understanding our evolutionary biology and just just our biology of ancient past understanding [1628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1628.279s)

what the ancient wisdom cultures figured out that was meaningful and then being able to not override that but add to enhance that with what we know and are going to know from all of the disciplines of science and advancing technology and [[exponential tech|exponential technology]] is a right integrative approach so in your opinion which aspects of this kind of shamanic initiation practices do we have [1655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1655.039s)

today that we can enhance with modern technology and what are the aspects that we have seemingly lost that should be brought back or kept as in the same way that they were doing it before all right well let's start with things that some wisdom cultures and digitus cultures had and i don't want to over romanticize that their versions of these were perfect or that all cultures had them [1681](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1681.2s)

there's obviously a whole mix of things there's some very meaningful stuff that we have lost it needs to be reincorporated in some way rites of passage is an example so the rite of passage there were many different rites of passage that happened you know in childhood when the child became self-sufficient in some ways that could be a rite of passage to recognize it [1703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1703.85s)

sometimes they got a different name at that point rite of passage of puberty and acknowledging what that meant our children growing up through puberty are experiencing their interest changes their body changed there's so many things and we just don't do anything to acknowledge it and what we do do to acknowledge it usually just makes it feel worse right we show them videos of [1725](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1725.42s)

gonorrhea and call it sex ed you know and all the rites of passage the rites of passages in menopause i have a friend that is a one of the top evolutionary biologists and he was saying that in his assessment one of the interesting ways to assess the wisdom of a culture is the role of postmenopausal women in the leadership of that culture and that women after menopause who can't give [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1754.03s)

birth who can't make more babies but who are still wired towards you know so have evolutionary wiring towards mothering have a unique capacity that neither premenopausal women or men have which is to be able to hold a mother energy towards the whole that when you have young kids it can still be easy to be a little self-centered to you and your kids but when you don't have young kids [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1778.19s)

anymore and yet you still have a mothering energy to be able to hold the whole whether it's the whole tribe or expansively the whole biosphere etc you know so like that's a rite of passage that we mostly just think of as a bummer that you know she needs botox now rather than any meaningful kind of thing so how we just understand life and the phases of life and the roles rites of passage [1802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1802.7s)

pretty much all of the wisdom cultures did something better than we do and and i don't mean that there was nothing barbaric but there there were some really beautiful things to that's one example another key example was they understood that there is a difference between comfort and happiness and they understood that happiness oftentimes [1824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1824.27s)

required beings that were resilient to discomfort and here's my narrative for this after the scientific revolution science was just awesome for so many things but the point of the challenges became so what's real is what's measurable and if something isn't measurable you can't do anything really with it and comfort was an easier to measure [1848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1848.87s)

thing than happiness was right we could kind of objectively measure how comfortable mattresses were and how good the shock systems and cars were and transport be able to measure evolution in those ways but measuring individual human happiness is a much trickier thing to do and so you can see how much we like people have physical comforts now even just average people that kings [1870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1870.5s)

didn't have in the past and yet we have rampant mental illness that we also didn't have in the past and one of the interesting things that you notice most wisdom cultures is that they have practices that intentionally induced meaningful discomfort to teach people to be resilient emotionally to discomfort so when you think about what a sweat lodge was or what a vision quest was or [1897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1897.62s)

even what hatha yoga is like yoga i don't want to say this is all yoga is but if you just think about yoga through the lens of get in a really awkward pose and then find your breath and find peace and then get in another really awkward pose and find your breath and find peace and get bent out of shape in all these different ways and realize that wherever you are you can find your breath and [1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1921.98s)

find equanimity find peace you're actually somatically imprinting that no matter what kind of position you're put into you can find your breath and find peace in any of them that's an amazing insight as people learn that their inner state doesn't have to be affected by the environment as much that leads to more resilient happy people as you have people that are only focused on making [1947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1947.9s)

their environment as comfortable as possible you can get people who are profoundly unresolved right psychologically so this is another thing that i would say wisdom cultures had that we have largely lost is the distinction between comfort and happiness and the importance of optimizing for happiness so that we don't have to actually have a lot of [1968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1968.929s)

real suffering you have to actually just induce nondamaging discomfort that's another example that is just really not part of our wisdom there are so many things if you think about the fact that they were all you know a hundred and fifty person tribes right [[dunbar number]] of tribes from an attachment theory point of view you had secure attachment to 150 [1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=1990.89s)

people those people weren't leaving no matter what and so you didn't grow up and we're all alone in the world and tried to find all of your secure attachment and one person called a romantic partner and then completely freaked the out if they don't want to be with you because you actually had really secure attachment across a lot of people and so again modern life nuclear [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2013.51s)

family homes private balance sheets people are very lonely and very disconnected and very overwhelmed and trying to meet their social and connection and attachment needs in way too few of places so they're i mean we could go we could do a whole show on what aspects of indigenous wisdom need reincorporated in the modern world without regressing right we're not [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2039.88s)

talking about giving up technology we are talking about reincorporating some things that were lost in the transition to a new kind of world structure that is different and better than either modern or pre-modern right and so on the other side of the spectrum what are the things that the ancient cultures figured out that we can actually do better or enhance with currently available [2068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2068.65s)

technology so many things so for instance let's take our vedic medicine or chinese medicine or any ancient system of medicine they were developed in a time in a place with some people right and so even if they were amazing at that time they were gonna apply to the genetics of those people and the kinds of things in their environment and the health issues they face so so for [2097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2097.66s)

instance i happen to have celiac right genetic predisposition to severe gluten intolerance i had some pretty severe gut issues i didn't know what it was about when i was about 18 i went to see some of the top ayurvedic doctors in the world and they had helped a lot of people i knew they saved my mom's life when medical doctors had diagnosed her [2119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2119.589s)

terminal they've done great things but they diagnosed me with a botts a disorder which was you know the worldview that they see through and so one of the things that i needed were heavy foods and they gave me as an example chapatis flat breads with a lot of oil well the flat breads were made of wheat and they would have killed me if i was [2135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2135.94s)

eating lots of them but there was no such thing as indians with gluten intolerance it was a genetic thing that was outside of that whole worldview right and simultaneously if we start looking at heavy metal exposure or exposure to plastics or pcbs or styrenes or phthalates or you know pesticides all the kinds of toxic exposure we have that can affect cancer neurodegenerative you [2160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2160.24s)

know endocrine issues the ancient systems aren't going to know what to do with those things do they weren't part of their environment so i would say you know knowing what the genome is is kind of a big deal having clinical chemistry being able to do imaging like these are really big deals is we don't die from infectious disease for the most part acute infectious disease anymore because [2186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2186.64s)

just hygiene and antibiotics and like that actually serve a role in in medicine painkillers you know like you it's important that people can endure pain discomfort sometimes to have emotional resilience but painkillers for dentistry are pretty awesome you know compared to not simultaneously we can say like following western prices stuff that the indigenous people didn't need [2209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2209.92s)

as much dentistry before they got western diet that's also true but there are heaps of places where we have let's even take eeg neurofeedback there are many buddhist monks who've went and worked with neurofeedback and found two things one they found that students could get trained to go into certain states of experience much faster with the neurofeedback than they could [2239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2239.079s)

with just traditional buddhist practice and they even found that some of the very advanced buddhist meditators got insights about their meditation that they hadn't had decades previously so i mean i don't think almost any of us would say all right let's trade and go live in indigenous culture even though there's so many upsides right because there's [2259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2259.13s)

also so many upsides to modern technological life but to be able to advance and integrate both is a great thing along the lines of rites of passage that you brought up earlier i think some of the basic ones like the rites of passage to become an adult you know becoming a teenager are pretty obvious but what would you say that are in the context of [2281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2281.51s)

our modern technology and world would be a good idea to create as a new rite of passage for example like the day you're allowed to use your cell phone or something being a cultural thing to be using [[social media]] in a responsible and effective way that's you know you're not addicted to notifications and that sort of thing i would say it is a great inquiry for us to think about the rites [2305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2305.24s)

of passage did have a lot to do with both making some sure someone was prepared for a certain kind of responsibility and predisposing them to handle it well and so as we get is we have the technological capacity to be more affected by our tech and to affect more in the world through our tech to you know we both need to prepare we both need to build the tech better itself so [2329](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2329.93s)

you know tristan harris and others are talking a lot about how we we're building text it is actually really mostly bad for humans right that is optimizing blue-screen clickbait dopamine addiction for people with really shitty attention spans and distraction issues and like we actually need to build the tech differently itself because again this is like this [2355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2355.22s)

is a gaming mechanics thing if i'm focused on how do i get the most number of clicks and the most time on sight that's not gonna make the happiest people right and the happiest people are gonna come do their and then probably leave and do different kinds of behavior that are not focused on driving clicking on add so if i learn how to hijack their dopamine opioid responds [2375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2375.38s)

this is a bad thing so part of it is that we actually just have to develop the technology differently and again that gets back into the theory of incentives right so just like with the pharmaceuticals if the incentives of the tech developers are not exactly aligned with the well-being of the people that the tech is being developed for we're gonna get a deep mismatch [2394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2394.579s)

right mm-hmm so anywhere that incentive and well-being is misaligned that externality gap is a problem and with [[exponential tech]] capacity that externality gap becomes a catastrophic problem but i think also preparing people to handle the responsibility of tech better is a meaningful part of it and so i would be very curious to see what the right rites of passage in the [2419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2419.26s)

future might look like this is why [[blockchain]] has become such an interesting thing for us because it it's a different way of looking at building these technologies while removing the incentives to optimize for a single entity you know for example clickbait time on site that sort of thing so i picture using the [[blockchain]] to develop an operating system for a phone that [2442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2442.279s)

would be open-source and people could develop something like maybe making adblock and that sort of thing native to the phone right and then you know building in a whole operating system around this principle of we're gonna make it better for the human and then i also picture having sort of the rites of passage and rituals built into that operating system - right so now let's [2465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2465.109s)

expend this one step and i'll say the the big picture of how i think about neural hacking is everything in your environment is affecting you right this concept of ontological design that we build environments and they in turn affect us like that's the fascinating thing is that natural selection is creatures that are being selected for based on their adaptiveness to an [2494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2494.359s)

environment where the first creature that radically changes its environment even one generation to the next but then we're making an environment that is in turn affecting us back and since we can't genetically change that fast we are you know neuro structurally changing epigenetics is changing and so when you think about everything right you think about the color and the khan [2515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2515.329s)

on your phone you think about the fact that it's two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional you think about just how much time we spend looking at a fixed focal distance you know on our laptop or whatever and that's a big part of why we lose our eyesight because our eyes are spending too much time looking at a fixed focal distance rather than then having a continuously changing [2531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2531.95s)

focal distance part of our [[evolutionary environment]] but you move from that to even thinking about okay so we're in a house where the paint is filled full of volatile organic compounds and the carpet is made out of with volatile organic compounds that aldehydes and etc that are either in decrypter carcinogens or neurotoxins and our indoor air quality is worse than freeway air [2554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2554.27s)

quality we need to completely change the building materials we use right and then you think well so those indigenous people spent very little time indoors so one of the effects was that they didn't have a ceiling above their head most of the time right and so they looked up at the sky alot if you're in a 8 foot ceiling you just don't look up a lot the actual neurological your eyes going up [2581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2581.33s)

in your head going up stimulates your brain in different ways that are involved in the creative process and awe and etc so everything from like the physical structure of our buildings to the structure of our digital spaces to colors to chemistry you know of houses of the entire built world we're building it for a very small number of metrics right like how many cubic feet can we [2607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2607.88s)

enclose how cheaply etc but when we start thinking about that it's all affecting the humans inside and we say well how would i build a house where my primary metric was optimizing the enlightenment and well-being of the human that was inside along with the well-being of the environment i love this i wish you could see uv space while you're talking right now it's just [2634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2634.31s)

fireworks but now it's the question about how do we rebuild the entire human built world to optimize for the thriving of all life right to optimize for the psychology and the physiology of all the and the non-human life and have a built world that reflects the design integrity of the natural world you know when when you look at in nature a hand is optimizing for a million functions at a [2665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2665.82s)

time it's not optimizing for a few right and it's also optimizing for its own adaptive capacity to do so many things if we start to understand what the difference between complex and complicated systems and learn how to actually grow [[complex system|complex systems]] right the how to do [[complex system]] design we're designing across a lot more parameters i actually think that's a fair way to [2691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2691.05s)

think about what humanity's task today is it's to rebuild all of civilization from scratch meaning our monetary incentives our social status systems our houses our digital environments the physical infrastructure all of it to rebuild it all from scratch aligned with thinking about all of its effects internalizing all the externalities think about all of its effects and say [2717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2717.3s)

what's going to produce the most thriving of the human and non-human life that connects with this system across all metrics of thriving that's our task well mind blown yeah so we might be reaching the end of our time here but this brings up another really interesting point of focus for maybe a future episode is talking about what you guys are doing [2740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2740.31s)

with neuro hacker collective and sort of the big picture systems approach you're taking the mothership yeah well i think we have flagged a few follow-up conversations on just this conversation already so we've got the hard problem of consciousness and existentialism maybe some deeper stuff about what is good in indigenous wisdom i think we talked about briefly before the show what does [2764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2764.16s)

transhumanism look like in this framework what is a kind of transhumanism that is optimizing for thriving across all metrics and that understands the complex complicated distinction and maybe how we're thinking about all those things and what we're doing neural hackers so it sounds like we have some conversations ahead definitely [2784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2784.98s)

fantastic cool well let's wrap up there then daniel is really good to have you on the show again minds blown i think we're gonna be talking about this for weeks and i offer one more thought about what you all are doing in your show sure we have so many more apocalyptic and dystopian visions for our future than we do possibly viable proto pick ones so when you guys you know are thinking about and sharing the show what are positive visions of a future if we share positive visions of a future that aren't actually tenable right they they aren't actually anti fragile in the presence of [[exponential tech]] or they presuppose things that involve going backwards in ways that would never be selected for [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2831.57s)

those are useless but to have more humans visioning what is a viable thriving civilization aligned with our evolving capacities what could it look like i think that's actually one of the most critical things that has to be happening more for humanity to make it and for those positive visions to come about completely agree there's two sort of key tenants that we have discussed so [2857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2857.85s)

much in the past which is behind our thinking about future thinkers which is you don't create a better future by visualizing the worst case scenario all the time and not thinking of the actual thing that you want yes and that works across the board with business with anything that we've had experience you know creating our lifestyle just like you can look at our lifestyles in the [2880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2880.74s)

fact that we've traveled for five years and basically done anything on a whim that we've desired to do because that's the thing we go after we visualize what would be great how what would improve our lives then we go after that thing and then the second thing is not being uncomfortable with discomfort and and negative possibilities of the future as well and actually spending the time to [2903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2903.84s)

incorporate antifragility like you said and recovering from negative situations into your plan for the future yeah so i think that that is you made that point earlier in the show and i think that is huge and we keep harping on this lately that you have to in order to be resilient you have to actually be comfortable with being uncomfortable yes definitely well i'm delighted to see the [2927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQqaclDmZ4&t=2927.529s)
