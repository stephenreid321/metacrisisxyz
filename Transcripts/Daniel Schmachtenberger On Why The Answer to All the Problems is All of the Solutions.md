people can get uh fundamentalist about their particular solution because if you're working on something you should really care about it but in really caring about it you can become overly narrowly focused so when i was first starting to try to wrap my head around like what is upstream from all of these various problems or what are the [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=23.22s)

underlying causes that everything from nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues what do these things have in common what do not a specific solution for one thing but a solution for civilization doing better look like i of course read the work of people and also had the fortune to talk to a lot of people that it's been their life thinking about these [42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=42.6s)

things and working on them and would ask their analysis and i got so many answers that sounded like this you know at the end of the day whenever somebody uses a phrase like that at the end of the day or the key is you can usually expect a reductionist thing to come next [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=64.86s)

um not always but you like you know sometimes you want to pay attention to that at the end of the day uh really the thing we have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing there's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military-industrial complex is the largest block of a global economy [84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=84.18s)

that you could ever have peace there's an anti-incentive on it as long as there's so much money to be made with mining etc like we have to fix the nature of economic incentives i'd be nodding i'm like this makes perfect sense right and if somebody else would be like you know the core of the thing that we have to address is [101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=101.52s)

education because you can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up different as as different as it is learning chinese is your first language versus learning english we're so neuroplastic by the time we're adults we're not that neuroplastic we're kind of screwed if you get education right we want adults who care about the [122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=122.939s)

animals and the oceans and the contend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education right we'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that and like i'm nodding i'm like oh yeah this is it and then somebody else would be like oh really the thing is it's about media because we're continuously being bombarded and that was before [[social media]] then it was [[social media]] we're being continuously bombarded and we were ready to go do a capital riot or a george floyd protester riot or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in if we could change the media environment of what people were in taking it would change all of these things and then someone else's like no no the thing is really at the end of the [158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=158.879s)

day it's about government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get carbon pricing properly and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed but we have to do that through law so how do we fix governance and law and [177](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=177.9s)

then somebody else will be like you can't because laws written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is is what's going to pay for that which is why you you have to think about economics and a lot of the other so the key is [[political economy]] and how do you get that so and on and on people would say no really the key is actually [196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=196.62s)

parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education by the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and [[value system]] has already said it happens early on we have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning and what i came to learn is they were [214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=214.319s)

all right right somebody else would be everything you're saying is so anthropocentric the key is the environment because we're none of us are anything without the environment like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much and like what is an economy like we can breathe without money we can't breathe without air [231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=231.0s)

and so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything and so what i what i learned was the answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions um there is not a theory of chains there's an ecology of theories of change it's so often when someone says what is the solution it sounds like someone's [252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=252.54s)

saying like what species is the forest like i don't know what you're even asking like a forest is lots of species lots and lots and if it's an old growth forest it's even more complexly interacting so what is the solution there's not a solution there's lots of things that need to happen so if anything i want patterns of how to think about it and i want frameworks for how [273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwKQw9p1wFs&t=273.0s)

to think about it and i don't want people to attached to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting and to realize the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities and you know in the [[political economy]] aspects involve lots of things and so and um the getting past the zealotists and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together is key to understanding properly
