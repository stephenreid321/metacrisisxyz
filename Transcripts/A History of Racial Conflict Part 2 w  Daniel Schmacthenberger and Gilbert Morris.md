applause music it's gonna be all right music all right everyone welcome to the stowa today we have our friend daniel schmachenberger returning and we are very lucky to have gilbert morris visiting us as well uh gilbert is a philosopher legal scholar and former diplomat and author of numerous books an [33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=33.719s)

absolute genius if you feel i was like blown away by it is the scope of knowledge listening to him speak with daniel um and both daniel and gilbert have uh had a wide-ranging conversation on the history of racism and racial conflict relevant to the american situation which was posted back on the stowa in september and they're visiting today to [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=55.5s)

continue that conversation with us here at the stowa so house today is going to work we're here for roughly 90 minutes i'm going to take in daniel in a moment and uh he's going to kind of have an open set the frame for the opening exchange that he's going to have with gilbert set the context of why they're here and why they're dialoguing about this issue and we'll pivot for q a so if [75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=75.96s)

you have questions anytime pop them in the chat i'll call on you can and ask your question to daniel gilbert if you submitted a question on the survey please let me know privately in the chat so i can know you're here and i can take in um and yeah and that's that's it on my end so uh gilbert daniel welcome to the [96](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=96.06s)

stella and daniel uh tag you're it you're on mute daniel which is one thing gilbert was calling about on uh quite often and that your exchange with him there you go all right can you hear me well now yeah all right thank you very much peter i'm happy to be um back and getting to do the q a of this session and uh happy to see [121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=121.799s)

everybody who's here um so opening remarks about the uh intention of this and a little bit of a recap from the last one that i'll give and then professor morris will do the same and then we'll dive on into people's questions which is the intention today um in case there are some people who are here that did not watch the previous one [142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=142.98s)

we did this was intended to be q a for that one if you did watch it awesome if not um the we it was our second recording actually and we squeezed it into like three hours because the first time it was like six hours and we decided that not enough people would make it through but it could really easily be much much more than that because [164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=164.22s)

what uh gilbert was trying to do was walk us through um a few thousand years of history of slavery globally of racial conflict globally of uh philosophic rationalization and economics uh benefits of uh slavery and the encoding in law that all create context for what was both in common in the american slavery situation with others but also [190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=190.08s)

what was very unique about it that brings us to the uniqueness of the current conflict that is all really important part of the context for saying how would we understand this well enough to know how to go forward um my intention in hosting that or in having that conversation with gilbert very important for me to be clear i do [210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=210.739s)

not have any deep expertise in this topic i had that earnestness and curiosity and the lack of expertise and there were a few people that did a kind job of educating me and uh gilbert was the person who was able to kind of walk me through the history of different schools of racial theory and how did critical legal uh theory turn into critical race theory turn into the woke [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=236.4s)

movement and blm and how is it held differently in different countries and kind of um helped me understand not just the history of it in an objective sense but the different views on it and um i think why it felt very important to me was somehow the i think the sto has done an [257](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=257.959s)

amazing job of being meta-political and not getting partisan captured and being able to have people that are traditionally far right and far left both be in conversations together but the stowa rebel wisdom idw corner of the universe that i have found myself in has a leaning in the anti-woke direction that affects a number of things racial conflict being one of them and it felt [284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=284.46s)

like it was um attack of the worst elements of wokism without a deep understanding of the history or the real issues and kind of straw manning rather than steel manning and one of the things we talk about so much is let's make sure to not be adding to culture wars that we're truly steel manning the other perspective to be able to find synthesis [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=305.52s)

and it felt really important to in this corner of the universe steel man the history of the racial conflict issues and the unique american case to say what is the actual [[problem space]] here what has what are the solutions that have been tried why would people not feel good about those solutions so as to be able to see how to forward it um most of the questions that people [328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=328.74s)

have today about how do we actually solve these problems or what about somebody else's um thoughts on the history will be directed at gilbert because he has the expertise here and i'm mostly here to support facilitate um i think one thing i want to just comment on is i get two comments almost equally often because of what i do have some expertise on in terms of global [[catastrophic risk]] there are people who are working in say the cutting edge of ai risk or synthetic biology risk and they're like why are you why would you waste any time focusing on an issue like racism that does not portend the ability to kill all life on the planet in the next few years [371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=371.46s)

when we're at the brink of possible nuclear war between nato and russia that both have strategic nuclear arsenals and when we're doing gain of function research with synthetic biology and leaky labs that could kill almost everything and the speed of ai is what it is you could work on those like racism is just not a comparably destructive issue to all life that's and [390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=390.84s)

how close we are with [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] on catastrophic die off of [[dead zone|dead zones]] and whatever i get another perspective that says it is a privileged position to be able to think about [[existential risk]] in the future because people who are living in the ghetto or comfortably in a refugee camp or whatever are facing uh [412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=412.319s)

[[existential risk]] every single day that is not a future forecasted thing it's a real here and now eminent reality that you're taking attention away from to focus on hypothetical things and specifically systemic racism through the system called police and the judicial system in many areas of the u.s is a [[existential risk]] to many people today so like both of those have some truth to [439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=439.68s)

them and uh i think the thing that has called me is how all of the issues are interconnected the meaningfulness of all of them and how we can try to pay attention to that hopefully more competently with finite attention and finite energy one thing that i will say about why is it actually a really big deal [460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=460.02s)

beyond why is it a really big deal to the overall thriving of life on the planet long term not just the individual people and populations that it is affecting in the u.s today or the history of it is when we see how much an issue like race in the u.s factoring how in how you cannot separate the institution of the us and its history from systemic institutionalized racial violence um and yet you also can't separate it from leading the world in democratic process rather than autocratic process today and both are true if it is at the heart of political divides in the west that can break the capacity to find any way forward of democracy itself which ends up leading way for autocracy to be the only way forward in which case they're like we just don't care what you think this is what rule of law is on from a top-down way that portends something for the environment and for nuclear issues and everything so [531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=531.06s)

if democracy is not a viable system that matters for every other issue for democracy to be a viable system we've got to actually be able to take issues that are at the hardware democratic institutions like this and say can we forward this in a meaningful way so there was statement of the color line being defining of the 20th century and the possibility that the color line [554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=554.519s)

is actually one of the defining features of the 21st century as well uh is part of why this is such a important meaningful conversation to me so with that gilbert thank you for being here and would love to hear your opening thoughts before we jump to questions thank you very much daniel uh and uh good evening it's evening here in the [577](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=577.92s)

bahamas uh so good evening to everyone um it's a great pleasure great pleasure to be here and it's always a great pleasure to be able to engage in conversation in which uh the presumption is not uh that we'll never get along um it may be that we won't find agreement but the agreement is that we should return tomorrow and continue our discussion and it seems to me that that [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=611.88s)

is a foundation of uh js mills uh notion of the marketplace of ideas in which people come to the town square to exchange between themselves without the notion of winning uh but with the idea and the ideal of understanding and protecting each other's uh capacity and opportunity to gain understanding and so i i appreciate that immensely um daniel [647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=647.339s)

and i met in during the pandemic i think and we got into several discussions on variety of subjects but we he saw certainly and i agreed that uh that this was a crucial topic which had to be addressed for the reasons which he uh which he has said what i've tried to do is to distinguish between race and [680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=680.94s)

slavery there were flashes of the notions of race uh very early on um in human civilization recorded history such as we understand it um in about uh 1250 bc in china the china like russia that has uh um uh eugene o'neagen a poem written by a black man as it's uh it's it's its key [714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=714.42s)

poem the magical cologne uh was china's uh sort of original um uh literary uh fear and uh so at this early stage there was a recognition of a distinction of race but there wasn't anything assigned to it that was either negative or positive in the current uh uh iteration um of the discussions on race uh for the most part [748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=748.26s)

um the strangeness of the culture behind the race was the key thing uh that was that was the point of emphasis if we come into uh the period which daniel and i began at uh beginning with aristotle's um uh concept of uh of the slave aristotle did something which he always does he if you ask aristotle which is the best form of government he doesn't [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=778.62s)

tell you he doesn't pick one he says well if you want democracy this is what it would be and if you want monarchy this is what it would be and if you want that and so on and so on so he's not very committal and he made it it seems to me a cardinal error on a very important subject and he's frozen is that so it seems and you want to pick up where he left off cannot i cannot pick up on the cardinal air that aristotle made um in this particular topic uh we'll wait for him to uh come back uh as we do i'm hoping that uh the opening remarks don't [836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=836.399s)

uh take up two months of the time because we really want to get into people's questions and so i'm curious if people as governor gets back online have questions that they want to start populating in the chat that would be wonderful and of course if it is a question is great if it is a comment that wants to [860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=860.16s)

be discussed that is also fine and since i do not know how long it will take for uh gilbert to get back i'm willing to engage any that i am competent to right now oh there he is with respect all right you're muted gilbert but you were back yeah all right we lost you at the cardinal mistake aristotle made yes we [893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=893.1s)

were just having saying that as you got back on and we finished our opening comments that uh we'd get to question so people are starting to work on questions but please continue with what was important i'm not going to say much more than that except to say that what we were able to do i hope was to trace how this open cavity conceptual [916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=916.56s)

cavity that i that aristotle left was constantly filled conveniently filled with notions of race as distinct from slavery and it almost became irresistible and has become something very interesting the people who were formulating these notions of race they knew that their uh their statements and their i wouldn't even say their [947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=947.76s)

attitudes their claims about race they knew that they were false the problem is when another journalism is in acculturation problem and an intergenerational flow of understanding and what eventually happens is the first generation knows what they're saying those claims are false but the second generation this is all they've ever known by the third generation it becomes [972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=972.36s)

uh completely accepted and now it's almost impossible to dislodge and then something interesting happens the victims of this who are speaking very broadly here uh they then having their backs against the wall take up the mantra of these racial nomenclature and definitions and where it is a badge of honor and then a false [997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=997.259s)

or meta-level conversation begins where people having been pushed or ensconced into a racial language and a racial acculturation uh that is misdefined then defend themselves out of that wearing it as a badge of honor and in this way you can never have a real honest conversation about race because both parties are speaking at such an asymmetry that it's impossible now to [1026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1026.959s)

achieve alignment and so what we are seeing with the uh we'll see what is generally called the wilderness although that was a positive thing at one point then it became a negative thing uh strangely enough and uh or like discussions about um discussions about uh um critical race theory critical race [1053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1053.84s)

zeros at one point merely the acceptance of a different perspective on the history some people say the truer perspective on the history to be included in the curricula and because the coordinates of the race conversation have been so bastardized is almost impossible for the two sides to meet in an area of understanding i'll make one last point about that [1081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1081.5s)

um i was having a talk with someone named richard kimball and he writes for a catholic magazine he's quite famous and when i arrived in in america in 1995 i was giving a talk at the saint thomas aquinas society that somehow met at the four seasons in washington dc how the christians have come up in the [1106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1106.82s)

world um but uh what was interesting there um he was talking about charter schools because each side seems to have these very strong positions on particular scenes and so he was talking about charter schools now coming from the bahamas and growing up in a british system where private school means means [1129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1129.559s)

means government school and public school means private school and all these things have to do with class rather than racial divisions or anything having to do with seeing the american situation where taxes are paid or schools are financed from property taxes and therefore the best zip codes have the best schools and so on when we were talking about charter schools and the [1156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1156.08s)

person saying to me oh you know one should have a right to choose which school one child goes to and i thought yes that's true i believe in choice so no problem therefore charter schools are an excellent uh way to exercise that choice my point was but don't you see that means that you've committed to the idea that the government that you everyone pays taxes to the government to run a proper school public school system and while you can have your charter schools you cannot make the argument that there's a clear tracery from the idea of choice to charter schools the real problem is your tax model is vulgar that's the real problem you are not having a real conversation [1210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1210.14s)

about stools because you're you're willing to say charter schools are not available to everyone for democracy to work you have to have broad education for broad education to work you have to have good [[public education]] [[public education]] the bargain that we make in democracy is that we pay taxes so that there's a generalized uh equality of opportunity across the [1235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1235.039s)

political sphere and if you get into these cul-de-sac arguments about fundamental principles and uh what seems to me somewhat exotic choices you're not having a real conversation about the fundamental issues that plague the society it seems to me and so uh i think the racial conversation has sort of migrated into such a cul-de-sac where people are not speaking really from the same position about from fundamental principles about some ideal which uh which everyone adheres to and even if people do adhere to it to them they seem afraid to admit it because it gives too much to the other side in the argument and the capacity seems to have been lost or somewhat [1292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1292.4s)

waylaid in this ability to be to make the proper argument to get to the point of the idea which probably would have broader agreement and where you'd have broader agreements i'll i'll leave it there that's what we we try to achieve in the first discussion and then we can we can go to questions i see some questions that i i would focus on because i think they're knowing [1317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1317.84s)

some of your um solutions i i think they're fruitful areas so just to kind of uh guide the conversation a bit it's so i think for many people it might be like why the do you start with talking about ancient china and aristotle um when we're talking about the situation in the americas and i [1337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1337.58s)

i beg of everyone to have the benefit of the doubt and the attention span to follow what seems like a circuitous route because it is actually fascinatingly relevant and oftentimes when there's a wicked problem that seems intractable it's because the framing is wrong and we actually have to step out of the frame so it's interesting if we take aristotle having been such an [1360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1360.62s)

influence to western thought and the idea of a natural slave that some people are disposed naturally as slaves and then we take motivated reasoning and the desire to answer the question who are the natural slaves like it was a very very good frame by one of the leading thinkers to then have everybody seeking to answer that and then of course economic motive creates motivated [1381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1381.74s)

reasoning and blah blah blah um so i think the topic of motivated reasoning and how mind-blowingly easy it is and destructive it is it would be one of the first things we would say we would want in a conversation regarding racial conflict does racial conflict ends up pertaining to actual conflict around economic issues where there are real [1403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1403.7s)

scarcities like if are we going to actually deal with it intergenerational wealth issues of the the gi bill should have happened those those cities shouldn't have been burned down the you know there should be black populations with a lot more generational wealth than they have are we going to have a situation where nobody wants to [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1426.38s)

just give up their wealth it just there aren't that many people who have it even if it came through non-fair means you want to give it up does that mean that then we use when we write law to change it where law means that it's backed up by police and a monopoly of violence it takes some people's money give it to other people there's hard issues in here right like we get down to [1444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1444.679s)

[[conflict theory]] over scarce rival risk resource that affects the actual materiality of people's lives so to at least say hey we're all subject to motivated reasoning here because the effect of this conversation has real materiality differences in our lives can we at least try to notice our unmotivated reasoning on each side get out of it you know recognize the [1465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1465.14s)

sensitivity of it and see a way forward that is at least possible i think that's a very good thing to keep in mind gilbert you went into the topic of schools and that's obviously one key thing and one of the questions someone asked here is about schools and i know one of your solutions has to do with schools and that given that one of the biggest [1486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1486.26s)

issues is not just could we make situations that have no institutional racism today could we make laws where we fix redlining and we fix institutional racism and police force today that doesn't solve the historical issue and wealth is a big thing and generational wealth is a big thing the historical issue is where the reparations would ever come up that is such a [1507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1507.919s)

of a topic and you discussed in the previous one the difference between restitution compensation reparations but how do we make a path that does provide fair quality of opportunity factoring how much that has been damaged in the past but that doesn't require some of the things that are more impossible to move through politically you have a model with the [1535](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1535.94s)

historically black colleges and universities that i think is really fascinating that i think is worth talking about here and as an entry someone asked us questions right i think one two if we could get to historically black colleges as a second topic and the first is someone asked kevin is there an ideal way to teach about [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1555.62s)

race and racial conflict in schools and he says ideally throughout different levels of cognitive and emotional development elementary up through middle school and high school obviously you have taught about this topic in a university setting uh different states teach about it differently in the us currently is there anything you'd like to share around how [1578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1578.659s)

the uh school education of this topic could be meaningfully better yes there's uh the tedious hermeneutics uh which goes into this because one has to perform a kind of unraveling first and then come forward uh uh because people are ensconced in the points of views with which they have been raised [1606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1606.62s)

and uh there are social um structures which seem to confirm appear to confirm people's prejudices in many respects um i don't speak of racism as an emotion for instance um but rather as a set of a set of structures everyone is prejudiced so for instance you hear the topic well [1632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1632.36s)

everyone can be racist or you know reverse racism or that sort of thing so one of the things we would try to examine without insisting that we had the right point of view certainly when i was teaching and in this case i was teaching the faculty to teach to to explore ways of teaching about race and one of the things i said was [1656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1656.72s)

well let's let's look at it everyone has prejudices who cannot escape that black people have prejudices white people have prejudices women men all these sorts of things but on the racial question it seems to me that when a person has a prejudice and also has the power and there's a structure that allows that power to exercise to make preferences on [1679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1679.94s)

the basis of race that that is racism so that's not an emotion or a feeling that is prejudice with the vertical of power to be able to apply that prejudice in the apportionment of benefits in a society where everyone pays the same taxes but only one group of people because of that prejudice and its relative the power associated with it to be able to uh to coordinate outcomes and [1709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1709.22s)

if we think of it like that it seems to me we get to some very interesting places about the notion of racism it doesn't let black people off the hook uh for being unkind and for having you know virulent prejudices but it also is able to demonstrate you're also able to isolate how power structures work in such a way that certain people can enact their [1736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1736.58s)

prejudices on everyone uh whereas other people have prejudices but they can't enact them they don't have the power structure or the vertical of power to do so so that's one little frame that we speak about one of the things i speak to to uh to black americans about is the term african-american and i try to explain that [1764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1764.02s)

if you think about uh um the continent of africa before the 17th century the the average person in benin could never see himself as an african he saw himself within the terms of this particular tribe so if you were a tiff uh in what is now nigeria or igbo or you were a bassa in what is now liberia or or a vi in one of those places that's [1795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1795.559s)

what you saw yourself as and you saw if you were a vassar you saw the vi as different from yourself as the mongolian from the swiss because you these are ancestral cultures with long oral histories and these oral histories and ancestralism created in fact a sociological divide between these uh these uh uh micro civilizations in some cases uh that separated them from [1826](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1826.039s)

one another so that the argument came to me that uh well the italians call themselves italian-american the you know the french call themselves french american although i've never heard of french american call themselves a french american i think most of the irish uh uh do that and the italians and thomas has a wonderful some [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1847.52s)

wonderful writing about that actually and um uh i would say to them well you've it seems to me you've begged the question because if in fact we're going to claim that the history has been a sort of lost right or at least uh uh there's been a a separation a displacement and a marginalization from the lines and the tracery of the history [1874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1874.279s)

it seems very much to me that you have to leave it that way and not use it you know so in the miniature as a bandage for that and rather leave it the way it is so it would mean that the blacks are just americans because they can't make a historical reference to a cultural or ethnological reference um to their point of origin and that forces the question to have to come up [1900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1900.559s)

over and over again and forces of public debate now you may not agree with that but that's in the framing it seems to me that in all these little areas one has to try and work these things up this is part of the walking back of the intrustication of what is i think are a set of bad arguments that sit on top of uh that sit on top of uh the history last point [1924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1924.14s)

at daniel in our discussion i made this distinction uh this notion that um that somehow people who were virulent um enslavers and also hypocritical enslavers that they were simply people of their [1947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1947.12s)

time and uh i reject that one rather vigorously um and i think we were able to demonstrate if you juxtapose the lives of lords mansfield and and thomas jefferson thomas jefferson takes a young girl who's 14 and uh he makes her his amenuences and amaretta um and he does that [1976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1976.34s)

uh uh and i remember joseph ellis the historian i met him when i first came to america and he was talking about presentism and it's funny that at the time he also made a statement when in discussing presentism uh he wrote a book called american stinks and he was promoting this book [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=1997.64s)

and it was a politics and prose in washington dc i think and uh at that discussion he said something like jefferson was far too moral to engage in an immoral relationship with an underage child and i didn't know what to do as myself i just come from the lse where you know we were methodologists and we analyzed things for the kind of brutality and i [2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2026.32s)

didn't know how to respond to this uh strange in a stranging statement um uh i think that this is part of the asymmetry and the what i've referred to as monumentalist history so there's a relation to history in which people wish there it to be monumental and when i say that you have in the schools at the moment in texas and some other places people deciding on which textbooks to [2055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2055.419s)

use and which not to use and people have said things like if history makes me feel bad we should rather stay away from that because we should have a glorious notion of our of our country and it seems to me that this is an unfortunate proposition it is not the case that the people that we spoke of uh were people of their times were the people of that time slavery was always [2080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2080.44s)

contested at every stage in history always contested racism was always contested at every stage of history the literature shows that all the research shows that in in in in an incredible way and even in america um from about 1630s to the 1690s when the notion of racial inferiority and white supremacy gained its paramount see [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2112.44s)

there were people who were opposed to it uh bitterly and a broad cross-section of people as well in fact you had the raging movement going on in in britain at the time uh with people like well later on with people like wilberforce and and some of those people and then before him uh um in europe uh people like nicholas of kuza and so on who argued against these [2139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2139.06s)

sorts of things and so we tried to give a frame in a way uh to allow scholars to see that the the arguments which have been developed in this late period um of our history but those arguments don't have a foundation and when you press upon them they tend to fall apart thomas soul um i hate to disagree with thomas so really i do [2167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2167.98s)

um but he he wrote a book um i can't remember the name just at the moment but it's about uh slavery the history of slavery uh and um i read i read the book maybe maybe three or four times on one of these online places and so on uh and it troubled me tremendously he gave a good disposition on how [2194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2194.38s)

um slavery evolved throughout the centuries but he completely ignored racism and how racism emerged as the currency for the economy of slavery all right and he at that point he lied it and so that means that he can't really speak to when we come to the american context the use of racism as a kind of epistemology that allowed people [2224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2224.2s)

to feel comfortable with the diminution of others and i think it's a mistake and i would have loved to have sat with him and kind of had that discussion with him and i i i would like to think that uh that we would have come to some accommodation uh uh on that point because if you if you if you throw your hands up and say slavery has always been with us american civilization is nothing [2252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2252.82s)

new that's not exactly true right it's not exactly true um what happened in in in the case of uh john cassar uh the the person who by civil law was uh transferred out of indenture into permanent slavery was an abomination of the law known to the people who executed it they knew that right that passed down throughout the centuries and became uh um uh it became a fixed epistemological point but that allowed everyone to or so many people to excuse uh their racism and their advantages so it gave them jefferson pointed this out and this is the incredible thing about him in the notes on virginia when he said i am [2308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2308.14s)

troubled at this question of the yes of this yes that whites have become accustomed to because in the ordinary uh processes of life you wouldn't have a situation where we can satisfy every need everyone every desire and all we hear is yes yes yes what happens when this goes away we will have corrupted ourselves corrupted our civilization and we would have had [2337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2337.66s)

entire generations of people who were used to this but that's because racism is the purchase for that attitude right was and i was very sad to see that uh that that soul did not address that and in a way that i thought it would have been affected lastly your point about hbcus blacks in america are canada such that if [2367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2367.3s)

the gdp of blacks were isolated from the rest of america it would be probably the ace or tense wealthiest country in the world it would be a member of the g20 if those if that is true it does raise a question uh which also on the other side seems not to be metabolized well on the wilk so-called woke side of the question [2399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2399.76s)

if you have this prowess that you have the wealth of canada why haven't we created a canada in america uh for blacks now that raises all sorts of questions about integration whether in fact there's a black community where the blacks work together whether they are systems that aggregate black wealth effectively whether the by black [2426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2426.52s)

movement which is seems to be more of a kind of folk sort of thing rather than a major economic initiative whether that's an issue um when you run the numbers it's something like one in 60 or 70 blacks is a millionaire and so it raises the question if there was a desire to be a real community in the sense of you say listen america [2452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2452.44s)

doesn't mean we cannot have our own build our own and integrate that with the rest of society because if you're in a negotiation and as a diplomat this comes home to me as a methodology if you have nothing on your side of the table or if what you have on your side of the table is disparate and dissipated across a vast panoply of people with differing opinions who can't cohere [2483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2483.64s)

around the center principles then you're not going to achieve anything in the debate now for people who are romantic about the idea of an integrated america uh this is a problematic thing but the hbcus open up an opportunity it seems to me uh to change that in the sense that they're already considered black schools and colleges although many of [2507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2507.94s)

them are land grant or funded uh not essentially or historically by blacks at all but let us assume that they are black colleges and universities for the purposes of discussion many of them are also in areas where they have large uh um rule they're not in urban spaces they're in large uh sort of places where you have lots of land many of them have [2534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2534.339s)

lots of property and that kind of thing and it seems to me it would be an interesting sort of thing if they were to focus on things like the 600 000 technical jobs in the united states that americans cannot currently fill and begin to educate with the aim of filling those positions after all is a way in which society is competitive and [2560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2560.92s)

this would give a competitive advantage and any negotiation you have to have leverage and this would provide leverage in the sense that blacks would still be integrated in american society in a much higher level and with a set of defensible skills all right defensible skills which means that blacks could not be ignored and it seems to me that uh if one were to build uh such a a a a a [2585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2585.22s)

construct around uh the historically black college and mind you they had it in dentistry and medicine and mortuary science these were the things that flowed into the 50 or 60 black communities in the antebellum period all right to distinguish them in america but those people did not divide themselves from america they did not separate themselves from america [2611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2611.92s)

they did not see them the the white brothers and sisters as their enemies they simply thought that we had to build our own circumstances led them to that and if you think of coming out of slavery for several centuries and coming out of the brutal period of a civil war and out of that civil war not asking for any benefits any help or anything of that sort and going out and building [2636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2636.22s)

those communities and then educating themselves to be able to be successful in those communities it seems to me that that is the greatest greatest ever um uh instantiation and exhibition of the american values in the history of the united states i'm sorry i went on a bit there gilbert i have a question for you that actually i think a lot of people might [2663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2663.099s)

also have i wanted to just underscore briefly one thing that you said um in case it wasn't totally obvious for everyone that i think is so fundamental when you said that thomas saul gave a history of slavery but he kept it separate from racism and that when you combine the aristotelian concept of a natural slave some people are naturally disposed [2688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2688.54s)

to slavery and it's actually kind of best suited for them because they cannot sovereignly figure out what to do with themselves when you combine that with uh darwin and kind of the early natural science that was heading in the direction of darwin with the motivated reasoning with the declaration of [2707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2707.8s)

independence you get something so fascinating and unique and gruesome yes where like if genghis khan has slaves he didn't say all men are created equal and all deserve life liberty in the pursuit of happiness he was brutal and he embraced brutality and it's like okay he's a brittle dude um and he was being brutal across racial lines absolutely but if you say all men [2728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2728.859s)

are created equal all deserve life liberty and the pursuit of happiness these people are slaves because they aren't men right because we we're actually having to say in order to keep intellectual congruency with all men are created equal we have to actually make them some evolutionarily lower type of animal that is a place where slavery with that other [[value system]] requires a philosophic formalization of racism that is really uniquely egregious and terrible and the persistence of that that is still felt today is so up and like i just want it's just such an important point i just want to like acknowledge what an important point that is because it is very easy to bring up the point there's always been slavery which is true [2772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2772.42s)

um but there has not always been a racial philosophy of slavery that had that sub-human egregiousness to it right um so i just want to like underscore that and say i think any remnants of that being fully uprooted and cleared is necessary right like there is no way forward as long as there is any remnants of that memetic complex right obviously there is a [2797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2797.8s)

remnants of it in our institutions and in our culture so how does the culture become free of it and how does the institution become free of it this is now where my question is for you in some ways there are issues that i'm focused on like how do we not all die from advances in [[exponential tech]] in something like synthetic bio when we're doing super stupid like viral hunting and gain of function research and leaky laboratories where you can make super nasty pandemic weapons and release them everywhere but we don't need to actually get everyone to understand that to solve it we need to get a fairly small number of people to understand why that's a really [2841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2841.0s)

terrible thing and create legislation the same thing with nuclear deterrence we don't need to get everyone to understand the complexity of the [[game theory]] on the nuclear deterrence well enough but on an issue that actually arises from culture right and then it's institutionalized and where you as you're saying some everyone can be [2859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2859.48s)

prejudiced but they're not all equally able of enacting those prejudices as systemic racism so those who are subjugated to that need to figure out how to enact power in some other you know kind of way and then when you're bringing up what the solution is that you start with like the concept of african is a problem right like even the word [2879](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2879.099s)

african-american we have to dissect that and we have to go back to the history of race in ancient china didn't have these issues and why the papal bulls were an issue and aristotle like what the chance is there for that level of depth of understanding needed to unwind the fact that even the words have embedded wrong concepts right even the term african-american or whatever have [2901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2901.119s)

embedded wrong concepts and that we don't need a few people to get it to re to do regulation we need widespread people getting it in the presence of vested interests continuing to feed them and in the presence of their own motivated reasoning around it like it actually seems more complicated what how is it how is there a way [2923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2923.44s)

forward there's a level at which it's very complicated i'm i'm i'm very sensitive to uh the choice of language because uh a language carries within it uh in the caribbean we have the belief that uh the the words of your mother carry a spirit in them and uh um and people say things like uh you'd better hope your mother does not speak [2952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2952.24s)

you know uh ill over you over your life so to speak and uh because uh we know from uh a pediatric neuro psychology that when a child is bombarded with a certain framing um of its essence it takes that it takes that to heart and in many respects if it's reinforced in the society you do a lot of work as our friend tristan harris does on the limbic colonialism which [2982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=2982.24s)

[[social media]] engages in so we've seen real-time demonstrations of this power of framing issues and using words and that's the thing when we use the wrong term we're not using words we're creating a conceptual framework and that framework is one uh that can influence people's self-conception and their perception uh of of of the world and what is society but some place where [3012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3012.92s)

we try to align uh the best frameworks uh in order that everyone would assume for themselves uh that uh that they can make uh the best of themselves in that in that social setting i don't think however that i think why we have to work on all these things at the same time i don't think we can get the nomenclature right first i i don't think [3042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3042.42s)

we can correct the school problem first i don't think we can do many of these things i think we have to do all these things at the same time if a if a if a group of people uh dr king asks a question are you are you seeking to change society or do you merely want a piece of the pie so and this this has the notion of the [3074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3074.099s)

export of harm at at the the back end of it so that's just to say if i'm a let's say i'm a black person who believes that the society in america has done me wrong and i demand uh to be integrated into society to get the job at aiken dump if i'm a lawyer to get the job at gilman sachs uh if i'm a banker to get tenure [3099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3099.96s)

at harvard if i'm a professor am i not simply asking to be let in to the very system that is in some senses reprobate in the sense that it never repented never reflected never really reassessed itself it just decided to let me into the same thinking paradigm that had me enslaved and it's now exporting that arm elsewhere perhaps in ways that we cannot [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3128.24s)

see and so the i asked this question in a book that i wrote uh called um uh the triptych papers and epistemologies of displacement the displaced individual exists and the question is whether he or she looks in his displaced situation [3156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3156.44s)

for a way to renew the society or is he looking out beyond his situation into the dominant culture which is refused him and seeking a way to enter that dominant culture but if he does guides it implies that there will be no reform of the culture since he enters the culture on its own terms [3180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3180.599s)

and may in some ways carve out unique spaces and niches for himself but those niches don't have the scale to be able to change the culture in a way that's beneficial for everyone so when uh one of the things i've told my students is don't own don't own atrocities don't own uh prejudice or or rather racism don't own uh these terrible [3212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3212.28s)

things which may have happened to you you cannot say that we as a people are fully susceptible to these things absolutely and forever it just you know that you can't make that argument what you can say is in this period with this overton window with this degree of self-understanding at this stage in history with this political structure [3240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3240.119s)

with these power relations and particles of power it prioritizes this sort of engagement with me or this sort of framing of my humanity now dr king's question if i want to change the culture or i could go with malcolm x here right the first thing you need is an act of [3263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3263.28s)

integrity that's what malcolm x said when you want to change a culture we need first active integrity the blacks and many whites who supported them antebellum period who became state senators and lawyers and physicians and so on that was an act of integrity aimed at changing a culture it's just [3287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3287.88s)

that they were overwhelmed by greater forces uh which they could not control so it seems to me that if we're going to be practical the first practical thing is to is for the blacks of america and perhaps almost everywhere around the world have to ask themselves are we a community for the purposes of our development and the defense not just of our humanity but of human value [3319](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3319.26s)

that would be an act of integrity all right because and and this is not a christian proposition it's not a christian proposition um in every wisdom text whether it's the vedantic scriptures or it's the works of confucius or wherever have you you see this paradigm shaping up those who have been displaced have an obligation [3346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3346.079s)

to both mitigate their situation and then to move forward out of that mitigation not with vindictiveness or revenge because it actually destroys uh the active integrity which was exercised instead you have to reconceive the culture that is the obligation and it's a very difficult obligation and you probably [3370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3370.92s)

will not live to see uh it come to fruition but that is the challenge and that's the human situation and i've tried in my in my in the best way not to to paint it uh to use a cliche with rose-colored glasses it's a great struggle and people have sacrificed both blacks and whites for the defense of human value in this way which currently does not define [3399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3399.24s)

uh the dominant culture so having understood that and seeking an act of integrity and i won't say here that i have the absolute solution i will say that if the attitude is such as the one that i'm describing where you mitigate uh uh the atrocities committed against you by being wise by being sensible so is there is there voter suppression yes [3429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3429.18s)

but then take it as an opportunity for everyone to get ids that's actually not a bad thing that's a very good thing in fact if you exercise yourself from that you can be the first to integrate digital ids among among black people that's a that's a good thing and that drives into a future towards which we are headed if we say that uh well you know blacks cannot succeed in this [3458](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3458.04s)

school or that school then come to the black universities and the society has a problem finding 600 000 persons to fill technical jobs make the degree six years uh as in sea on spo in france or uh french law degree and build the basis and the foundation of an excellent education uh thomasle draws this i'm all over the place at the moment but thomasville draws this [3487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3487.8s)

distinction the blacks the american blacks in russia who uh were there after the second world war remained there after the second world war in japan and germany perform in education at the same level of their japanese russian and german counterparts the literature shows it explicitly [3517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3517.98s)

so in formulating this drive towards this active integrity black americans actually have something to look at they have they have an example to look at in three cases where people of their own uh history uh tradition and culture are succeeding in ways that they're not succeeding in america the answer to that is not to ask what is america doing to [3546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3546.42s)

me but how can i mitigate my situation in fact reflect the success that those people are showing in those places find out what they're doing and replicate that but who is going to initiate this and how will it be initiated at scale all right in order to uh to somehow impact the culture that is the question [3570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3570.0s)

so i'm sorry daniel there's no easy answer no no and i know you know that there's no easy answer and there's no no one thing that can be done we have to promote the idea of the mitigation of atrocity and that's not blaming the victim in every area of law if you if you read law and you understand and i'm not talking about [3594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3594.42s)

jurisprudence and constitutional syria i'm talking about basic everyday law of tort law of contract you are called upon to mitigate the law of insurance you are called upon to mitigate someone burns your house down you saw them burning your house down and you come upon the house and it's half burnt down and you stood there and said that someone burnt it down you did [3616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3616.68s)

nothing all right you're penalized for that and so this principle of mitigation has to be something that in the parlance of today's uh today's uh cultural narratives we must normalize and uh and then this active integrity is another is another element understanding that we are having asymmetric conversations that's another [3642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3642.78s)

element and then building leverage four blacks those blacks who are committed building leverage for them you have the nba players you have these celebrities you have the the wealthy black businesses you have large numbers broad cross-section of black middle class people can an appeal be made to them in any way that is not prejudicial [3665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3665.94s)

against whites or uh sue's enmity against the dominant culture but just to say in our house we are taking care of those things which are priorities to us but having built the house we invite you so in our conversation i made it very clear the historically black university should not try to be exclusively back in fact if they are going to do what's necessary to revolutionize the culture [3692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3692.579s)

and create an evolution in self-conception towards human value and the thing they would do is say this is a place that's predominantly black in which our white brothers and sisters can achieve their full potential and if enough of that is happening the society itself has made itself so sick that these places become repositories of [3716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3716.579s)

human value that have their own attractive power now that may sound like a full speed of idealism but i'm afraid that uh in the circumstances it's a choice between that and nihilism i think it's that narrow it's a choice between that and nihilism and uh um president uh bush the father had this phrase which i enjoy so much it didn't mean anything that he said it i think it was written by peggy nuna who has a way with a turn of phrase and it's a thousand points of light that's the solution a thousand points of light right and if any social efforts that we were seeking to undertake to address the problem [3769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3769.74s)

of the power structure of racism i think this thousand points of light uh approach would be the approach and i do know that people like mark eckert's reagan thomas and some of the others are doing a lot of that work already in a wide variety of communities there were people like marvel columns uh um the teacher in chicago who took people in with no particular system taking [3797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3797.7s)

grandmothers and three-year-olds and somehow got everybody into university what is that an active integrity an act of integrity that was a mitigation against the situation the forces that were arrayed against her and so if the dominant society wants to understand how is spending all this money on children who are not going to university and marva collins can take over a warehouse and teach three-year-olds and grandmothers and get them into university obviously our resource allocation and all the efficiency propositions that we brag about they they don't work and so in this case from the displaced environment comes a new epistemology capable of renewing the culture the dominant culture uh to me [3846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3846.72s)

that is the cycle and we have to somehow ignite that cycle there are so many questions that i want to ask regarding the real politic assessment of what it actually takes to do the thing since the ethics is usually considerations of symmetry but the ability for enactment is usually considerations of power and the bunch that i want to get into but in lieu of [3874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3874.5s)

time i want to get to questions uh oh i'll paraphrase what you've said overall because i think what you're saying so uh mirrors what i end up saying talking about [[metacrisis]] um there's not a theory of change because there's not one cause of the problem there's and there's not even one problem right there's many different aspects of [3898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3898.079s)

problems there's many elements of it so there's an ecology of theories of chains that are needed trying to get too reductive to what the solution is and even too reductive in the problem framing is then where people get polarized on the thing and so this is when you're saying you know a thousand points of light there's an ecology of theories of change [3916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3916.2s)

and there's this dialectical principle throughout everything you're saying which is don't generate enmity in the dominant culture while seeking to change the dominant culture um seek to change it don't you seek to get a piece of the pie and don't just seek to have your own segregated thing but don't create enmity with the thing that currently has more enactment power [3934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3934.5s)

than you have it's it's not an answer it's a it's a set of considerations to hold and similarly when you talked about what should be done in education you were saying don't just say man of their time because that's nonsense and yet i've also heard you say at other times don't throw jefferson out as purely evil you have to hold was a great man but not [3954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3954.0s)

a good man so what i'm hearing you say is in education share the authentic complexity don't share a weaponized uh a cited version that then has other people say hey you left out something critical and then they hold another side try to share inadequate complexity of the things so people don't reduce it to something that then polarizes and um it seems like what [3976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3976.14s)

you're saying overall is it's complex how do we educate people into the authentic complexity and how do we generate solutions to deal with the authentic complexity and it is the reductive process itself that ends up leading to a lot of the intractable problems so i really appreciate that i wanted to ask when it came to questions um teams appropriate [3998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=3998.64s)

yeah people in the audience who are here who happen to be people of color if you have any questions or thoughts first i wanted to offer priority to that and then see if anybody else does in remaining time i have a question it's more along the lines of like [[sensemaking]] and communicating that synthesis because i worked in a space where i was helping um black founders get funding some mentor capital and i came across a lot of the underlying issues of why certain founders have barriers and you know the education system etc like why we had less founders of color in the pipeline and in the whole culture of polarization and people picking one side it's just so [4050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4050.96s)

difficult to communicate truth without giving um a point to the other side like one example is um absent fathers like that's something that has been proven to have a negative impact on someone's life and then their economic outcomes etc so it's like how do we best communicate the truth of like what are real barriers that are [4071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4071.18s)

impacting black people today without giving a point to like oh this is why racism exists so this is why like the culture is inherently bad in producing good people that are contributing to society like i have found that very difficult in doing the work yes i i i can emphasize with that i was a private diplomat to the swiss private bankers association [4099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4099.319s)

and if you want to see superiority you need only spend some time around swiss private bankers and you'll have a clear picture of how they see themselves and do try to understand it wasn't superiority against me for superiority against everybody particularly the french and uh so one has to one has always [4125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4125.239s)

when when you're in this kind of frame you are asking yourself all the time whether it's racism should you be hurt by it right it's probably always unfamiliarity and that you're not part of a tribe and that you're not trusted in some way to act in the manner in which they act and this is a very difficult thing so that uh is a kind of cultural expectation [4154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4154.4s)

which people have in those kinds of circumstances when it comes to the vcs there are all sorts of systems one of the things uh i'm somewhat known for um is a theory of sovereign funds and a new principle of citizen equity and that is that the the lockian and uh or the hobbsian uh constructs um of political science even down to john rawls for whom i have some sympathy [4190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4190.52s)

at least is [[thought experiment]] in a theory of justice um but the idea of the passive citizen who merely and what you have is this problem and it's relevant really in the transition from active monarchies with actual political power to parliaments and congresses and so on the power the vertical of power didn't really change that much so that effectively we've been constantly electing monarchs and one of the ways in which that is true is the notion of government ownership because if the siri is correct democratic theory even john locke's very sloppy theory in the two treaties on [4240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4240.02s)

government it means that government doesn't own anything the citizen owns and the government manages for the sake of the citizen and you know estonia has just made this a principle of their constitution that they are not the rulers of estonia right they are providing government as a [4263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4263.9s)

service to the citizen now i add to that an economic component that says the resources of the country belong to current and future generations and therefore is the obligation of government to create a structure to allow people to realize the benefits of those resources and the preservation of a share of those resources moving [4288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4288.56s)

forward for future generations it seems to me that given everything from automation uh to the wells gap which affects more whites than blacks uh uh to the loss of belief there one of the things i see across the world it's not a question of whether people are conservative or liberal anymore people have lost the capacity to believe [4314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4314.6s)

in government it seems to me almost everywhere so if you took the estonia principle of government as a service and you added to it the idea that citizens are not passive in terms of the economics of their societies and in fact there ought to be something called citizen equity all right by which citizens have some direct measure of control or some direct [4342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4342.199s)

engagement with the economic resources of their societies and and and and and have to actively engage in preserving some of that value for future generations this produces a more responsible citizen but there's no impediment for blacks or any group of people beginning to enact this kind of economic model right now you you are all the all the financial [4370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4370.58s)

architecture all of the various structures are available from churches to social organization to community groups to black colleges however you wish to see them the tools the the financial tools and the structures are available to create a situation where and and let's imagine that it's created wax creators for themselves [4397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4397.58s)

if you have no enmity towards the dominant culture and you're open to them on the basis that they ought to have been open to you in the first instance according to their their primary principles then it creates this new momentum in the social order that that this is what dr king was aiming at with the poor people's march [4422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4422.78s)

on washington he saw almost in an epiphanic way that are i i can advocate for blacks but i'm actually doing blacks a disservice because blacks have to live in a world with whites and they have to integrate with each other on police forces as teachers on school boards and these [4446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4446.36s)

sorts of things in various neighborhoods but the truth of the matter is that the dominant society is prejudiced against these poor whites as they are against the blacks now how do we get them to see that well again this act of integrity right where you use the to end this mitigation where you use the tools to create this new paradigm a paradigm that [4474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4474.739s)

is open-ended that invites all who believe in these in these principles and the the principles of citizen equity human value and government as a service to the people that's a completely that's the 1872 republican manifesto that's what that is which fulfills the declaration of independence more readily than any manifesto in the history of the united states and so you know we i don't think i do think that many of the so-called black leaders have really been kind of racial entrepreneurs in some way and they have operated in this space where the asymmetric conversation they have found niches in that asymmetric conversation that benefited them and the people who accorded with them for an [4533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4533.06s)

economic game and that we don't want to say that there are thieves and you know hate mongers that's not what we're saying we're just defining the model that they have used and we're saying that's the wrong model this estonia model of government as a service breaks the hold of the old monarchal imperative [4561](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4561.62s)

about government as somehow being dominant and the owners of the country so to speak and it becomes a rousseau in democracy such as you have to a limited degree in switzerland probably the the most uh decentralized country in the history of the world um and blacks can achieve that now and you don't have to wait for everybody to get on board there'll be any number of [4587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4587.719s)

large number of whites and other uh groups that would cotton to this kind of uh thinking because it's not socialism which i know is a bad word in america it's not socialism right it's not your typical rapacious capitalism that's based on extraction and the destruction of human value so it's not neoliberalism all right it's not mixed government it's actually [4613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4613.52s)

on the principle of personal responsibility if government is a service to the citizen then you maximize personal responsibility in that paradigm if the citizen has equity and has already a responsibility to preserve some of that equity for future generations you already have the [4638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4638.78s)

economic discipline that militates against the kind of greed that we have seen you see and so if we were able to somehow uh map out such a model it seems to me that we have a message then to send and then it would be a point of connecting to those thousand points of light and then generating the overton window which drives that message and [4663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4663.02s)

reforms society such as we have been discussing jen i will um offer a short additional answer and gilbert was uh going into the economics since you were talking about working in venture capital and being able to you know provide uh economics to people doing startup projects and i think one of the major conflict areas the [4689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4689.9s)

world looks at today is racial conflict one of the other deepest [[conflict theory|conflict theories]] is economic basis of conflict so obviously looking at economic self-determination of groups it makes a lot of sense why there's so much focus there um but i also heard you asking them a medic question which is [4708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4708.199s)

how do you acknowledge yes there are a lot of black children who are growing up without fathers in their home without conceding a point to racist see they cause their own problems um and so i want to offer something to the communication because i heard of a medic question and i would say there are two things that i'll offer one is the [4732](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4732.26s)

question itself is really important which is how do i communicate to whoever i'm communicating to while being cognizant of who is not my intended audience and what they do with that message it is mind-blowing to me how bad we are currently at paying attention to the effect of our message on our on whoever isn't our intended audience right [4759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4759.02s)

and so we don't pay attention to the polarization and blowback of and to a large degree it's because of the actual structure of the political process and voting it's why people like larry lessig really want ranked choice voting is because it would disincentivize polarizing the other side against you currently there's only an incentive to get your support base to support you in [4782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4782.719s)

other rising the out of the other side is fine and but of course if you want to succeed in anything you don't want to engender a very large percentage of the world to hate what you're doing and so the general principle for everyone communicating about everything to say okay who's my intended audience marketing 101 what am i saying to them [4802](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4802.04s)

what am i trying to do but also who else is going to hear this how are they going to respond because they're political actors and they're going to do stuff so how do i make sure i'm paying attention to how everybody's going to hear it i so wish everyone thought about that a lot more to avoid blowback and polarization on the particular topic of fathers [4823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4823.1s)

though that one seems so straightforward to me there's many elements that just to start with if when someone looks at the reconstruction period where black communities were becoming wealthy black people were becoming doctors and lawyers and senators and etc [4846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4846.199s)

you had successful monogamous marriages where the fathers were in the home right there's nothing about black jeans that couldn't do that they did that um so we're like okay what happened and when you look at the total amount of rape that happened during slavery and then following slavery and the fact that the men could not actually protect [4873](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4873.92s)

their wives from it and that in the even the period following slavery where you had all of these reasons to arrest black guys and put them in jail forever for for for really things that had no basis and reasonable due process for jurisprudence for loitering for whatever so so white people and even white police officers could harass fondle rape [4898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4898.52s)

whatever white women and the men were completely emasculated can you spend 400 years emasculating the  out of men of a particular type and not have that have an effect on how they know how to be a man you know so it's like yes there's a problem in the black community with fathers but there's a reason there's a problem and the reason is not because black [4921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4921.679s)

people just suck at being fathers right like there's an actual historical reason so when you communicate about it that's the other part of the story you have to communicate there's uh there are a couple of things there i i draw on what you said uh daniel quite effectively and i apologize i didn't i left that part of your your answer unattended [4944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4944.42s)

um the the the thing i would say is this i always like to ask under what conditions that people do what they did so not only did uh in the antebellum period did people become blacks become physicians and uh uh lawyers and mortuary scientists dentists dentistry was a very very big very big one and insurance uh was another uh a big area but state senators school boards all [4975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=4975.02s)

these kinds of things and all over a gross point in detroit rosewood we know about tulsa also but uh you know people forget about uh north and south carolina these were places where people uh people had developed uh uh interesting and powerful societies um uh washington dc another place uh where people have developed these uh really amazing successful societies with [5002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5002.14s)

good families and good jobs and these sorts of things and if you think about this period daniel this is when the lynching paradigm took place so if you had a father a brother a son a husband right an uncle a grandfather women were hiding their men the black culture is so so if you go from eugene genovese's uh analysis of the plantation system in [5033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5033.219s)

which enslaved men ceased living in the same compounds with their wives or their their their their female counterparts because if the the enslaver knew that you had uh um affection for someone they could use that as leverage against you and they could come and rape and punish you and and draw on your emotions but terrifying violence which was exercised again and [5067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5067.12s)

again and again you can read philip curtin the plantation system all these wonderful books uh which lay this out for us uh uh david byron davis uh also and others so if you if you think about that the circumstances under which during the antebellum period these families were established means that those people had a high inclination this [5094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5094.36s)

position and propensity towards family even after coming out of the plantation system where they were separate from their families right so somehow they had maintained the ideal and they kept that ideal in treacherous circumstances so after 1879 and the compromise made by president grant that removed the northern army uh from the south new orleans for society the first massacre [5128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5128.8s)

all right and then jim crow came in uh after that in in the lead-up to the first world war so so here you are you've come out of enslavement right you haven't asked for anything you built a bootstrap so you can build yourself up by your bootstrap all right and so you've done that so you are an instantiation of the highest performance [5158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5158.26s)

of the american idea all right and what is the response to that slaughter you know mayhem misery and you come to a compromise and and the 1872 shows when the the lincoln republicans were in the position to enact the true values of the declaration of independence america showed that she preferred not to have that and that was defeated right and then in comes jim crow so now you're suffering that and as daniel said both men and women black and white believe two things about men he had to be a protector and the provider [5212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5212.679s)

and black men in the situation could do neither and this is where and at the same time you were fully emasculated not only that a white sheriff could walk up to you on a sunday morning where you're walking with your wife and your children going to church and could harass or fondle your wife and there's [5235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5235.78s)

nothing you could do and imagine a man standing there feeling all the salus of himself and wanting to defend his his wife and his family and she's telling him don't do it this is this is what we have to get the teeming cool tyrion misery of this situation now if you understand that [5261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5261.88s)

and then you go into the lynching paradigm it's further emasculates the male because now he's the pr he's the hunted for the protected the infantilized all right this this is not french theory this is what happened all right and out of that leading up to the first world war there's a fear that blacks will not come [5289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5289.48s)

forward and fight w.b dubois and the crisis magazine writes an essay called close rights and what he's why does he say that well he says that because of the despondency and the nihilism that had taken over the black community he was saying listen wake up let's go to this war and show we're not going to this war [5317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5317.8s)

to win the war that's not our primary purpose our primary purpose is to demonstrate a patriotism to those who do not want us and will abuse us and see us dead close ranks with them and let us damn it because they cannot be so psychologically uh infected with racism that they will see us go to die for a country that has treated us this [5348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5348.639s)

way and upon our return they will not accept us if not as heroes at least as equally patriotic to them uh i haven't seen very many works that for all the studies of trauma and so on and i read them uh incessantly uh i haven't seen very many works on the trauma of this period of people going through this kind of thing [5378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5378.52s)

ralph ellison however writes a novel in which he depicts the condition of a man who has gone through this and that's why it's called invisible men i am invisible to the society right and so this is why dubois says i ever feel my tuness i'm a human being and a black man and and i can add to [5403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5403.3s)

that a fucodian although some certain british friends of mine will never forgive me for mentioning it but foucault advanced this concept of the panoptical if you are black in a lynching paradigm you live in a panopticon if you are black in a paradigm where groups of men get together at night and come into a house and chase a black [5431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5431.86s)

man out and then hunt him in the woods with dogs you live in a panopticon of terror that's where you live blacks cannot nurse this pain this is the problem they cannot nurse this pain this is the mitigation part and dubois was seeking away for both mitigation and an act of integrity and [5460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5460.48s)

active integrity which could not be demanded by whites and active integrity which could not be expected by any reasonable psychology an act of integrity that was so profound and so astonishing the blacks followed dubois went to war performed magnificently in the world with accidentally only to [5486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5486.88s)

return home to be lynched in their uniform and so in a sense dubois himself moved to ghana convinced of the idea okay i get it you you you really don't want me you don't believe in your principles and values and even when you have breached your battles i don't ask you uh uh to repent [5517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5517.6s)

you don't ask me for forgiveness you continue abusing me and putting my life in danger reducing me uh to less than human and so i say i will take the extraordinary step of behaving in such a way that no human mind can deny either their culpability and my grace and yet both [5547](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5547.179s)

are denied both we're talking about fathers in the first world war the men went to war the women went into the factories black women when the men came home the women left the factories thinking that their husbands would get the jobs [5569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5569.32s)

such was the social order at the time but the men did not get the jobs they did not get the jobs when the second world war came iraq the mothers of those women said you will get a job but now you will not make room for this man and um uh orlando patterson the brother of the or cousin of the former prime [5603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5603.88s)

minister of jamaica pj patterson says sociologist at harvard wrote a book called blood of our sons i disagree in the thesis of the book but he lays this out in some measure and so when you're struggling against all of that let us come down to today there is a gentleman who is on youtube he gave a ted talk and he says uh if i go into a radio station or i go into a music um you know someone who commercializes music and say i want to talk about jewish people and i want to talk about killing them and them killing each other and so on they would throw me out of the building okay i want to come and talk about a white women and shooting them [5652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5652.3s)

and killing them and naming them and so on and that this is part of my manhood they will be shown at the door it was an interview with someone who presumes to call himself charlemagne the god as if charles the magnificent wasn't enough um but he gave an interview with a gentleman who is a radio a music [5678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5678.4s)

executive and asked him why do you keep giving people these formulaic songs about black young men about killing each other all right and about having what they call beef with each other that's kind of the sort of thing and i'm not saying that all rap music is bad i'm not condemning an entire genre [5701](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5701.86s)

uh i'm saying that this is a particularly pernicious aspect of this genre and i defy anybody to tell me how you can find beauty in self abnegation i i don't know how one can find beauty in that and he his answer on live television was i have people to feed we have to eat and there's a market for that kind of music [5733](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5733.06s)

so again when young men are being socialized by that and then you add to that that tracery of history that we've just gone through how are you going to have fatherhood how is fatherhood going to be a priority when baby mamas and multiple baby mamas and when you can refer to a human being who has been with you to [5764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5764.02s)

produce a child and i'm not saying you have to speak of them in sanctified tones i merely saying again this language this categorization right is a categorization that denudes the human person of human value right it does not bear bringing its strain affection it does not bring in its train obligation it does not bring [5790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5790.48s)

in its strain responsibility of any kind and so if if if people are living in those circumstances and find themselves having to survive in those circumstances how are you going to prioritize fatherhood family uh the sort of psychological resources necessary to live within a family context to deny yourself to sacrifice yourself for the [5819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5819.46s)

immediate others who depend upon you to keep your word to be of good conscience all right and to be of a sturdy and uh and uh and reflective spirit how is that going to happen what is the context for that and so the cycle continues and i used to tease some american friends of mine who taught with me at george mason university that they they would talk about having [5848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5848.5s)

bad fathers but i would they worship their fathers despise their husbands and idealize their sons and so that's the cycle that's the triangulation it will it will continue because your father is doing what your husband is doing but it's immediate to you so that's the problem but the son who's about to do it to another young woman he's idealized in all responsibility is removed that's not something that's inherent in blacks that is a feature of a social circumstance and a set of constructs any history which has become asymmetrical to its potential solutions [5895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5895.12s)

and that has produced the world uh that we have today so it seems to me i am glad that you answered that and i'm glad that you asked that question i think uh the idea that nihilism makes hedonism an appropriate rational response i think that's so deep for so many issues it's for this issue and consumerism and so many things from from a like moral psychology perspective under nihilism hedonism makes sense from a uh evolutionary theory perspective if i could get killed at any time uh maximizing the chance of offspring in many places makes sense um and so it's it's interesting to think about that we are past time there's so many places [5945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5945.94s)

that i would like to go but uh gregory thomas is with us and he is also a scholar in related topics and i'm really happy to see him here and i wondered if you had any thoughts you wanted to share with us as we're wrapping up thank you so much daniel and and thank you gilbert uh professor morris um i i that's mainly the spirit of my comment in gratitude for what you shared [5971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5971.38s)

um i i'd like to briefly not counter-state but um provide some other narrative approaches to the stories that we're telling because as we know in certain meta theories integral meta theory for example that many things are true but partial [5999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=5999.219s)

so there's such depth of truth in historical content that you've shared that i certainly agree with at the same time there are countervailing narratives that we can draw upon so for example now the period you've been talking about of course going back to aristotle but mainly 19th century through the early [6018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6018.78s)

part of the 20th century in the jim crow period there were certain dynamics many of those dynamics continue so we could point to um the the welfare system where there was a disincentive for the men to be involved in the family because if you put together you know two incomes you reduce the social support and network that's needed and and so [6047](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6047.699s)

other other incentives against fatherhood so that's another example however there are studies that show that even if they are not a husband in the home um that people racialized as black black men spend more time with their children than any other group now that's a whole nother narrative but it's also some [6071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6071.76s)

empirical research behind that but i'm going to go off this to give another something that i'm very familiar with a tradition that probably started at the turn of the century but you it really gathers steam from the 20s through the 70s uh through the work of elaine locke for example you mentioned du bois elaine lock is a very par important part of this story uh zora neil hurston ralph [6099](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6099.96s)

ellison who have you mentioned albert murray um there is a a a perspective on our history that is not just focusing on how much we were screwed over and the devastating impact of that which is true but what we were able to achieve in spite of that yes how do you have a people to create through cultural forms music and other forms that totally influence the music around the world right one of the things that ralph ellison talks about this is not something that people highlight about ellison's work is that he makes it clear that if you are able to get people to dance to your rhythms to uh uh play music that's based on the [6154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6154.199s)

blues which is the foundation of american music if you're able to go from a march orientation where you are told what to do on the one and three but based on music on the two and the four and get people around the world tapping to that and dancing to that that you have actually imposed your values on the society so then you have a book like this [6182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6182.699s)

african founders how enslaved people expanded american ideals by david hackett fisher that talks about how in different regions of this nation black americans influence the concept of freedom and the very culture we live in so in spite of all that we've gone through we've had a profound impact on the culture of the united states and the [6210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6210.54s)

culture of the world so i'll just leave with this there's another book that i would like to mention culture of growth the origins of the modern economy by joel moker economic historian he talks about cultural entrepreneurs you mentioned racial entrepreneurs and yes professor morris there have been many who have gotten their little niches [6234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6234.119s)

through being entrepreneurs of racism race anti-racism but there are also social entrepreneurs cultural entrepreneurs i consider myself one you know those and i appreciate you mentioning me before who will be in the marketplace of ideas and will actually be entrepreneurs of certain epistemological frameworks ontological frameworks that can [6262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6262.86s)

influence the discourse to use it for cohen term to influence the very discourse we're in and we're in a period of such political polarization of such um chaos within your [[social media]] and such that there's opportunity there for people and many of you find this in the heterodox spaces you find it in the [6288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6288.96s)

stores in the rebel wisdom you you find it in these different places you have an opportunity to actually be entrepreneurs of not just ideas but certain collectives certain we spaces that you can develop so that we can influence the larger culture and we don't need everybody to do this the enlightenment didn't happen to the majority of people believe in [6314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6314.1s)

certain a set of people with particular ideas that didn't influence the course and development of modernity itself the same thing can happen now and the last thing i want to say because you obviously you've given me the the floor here and there's so much more i've been i've been chomping at the bit to share so i'm uh you know i'm sorry if i'm taking so much time [6337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6337.08s)

but i really want to set up a conversation between you professor morris and danielle allen harvard philosopher danielle allen who is one of the preeminent political philosophers of our time when we talk about democratic theory she highlights the importance of ralph ellison as one of the primitive democratic theorists of the 20th century in his work she also [6361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6361.44s)

highlights in this article um this essay i have integration freedom in the affirmation of life dr martin luther king as a key 20th century philosopher political philosopher but she is that so are you i love the ideas that you've laid out and the framings we need to have people who are willing to not be reticent to actually be entrepreneurs of ideas [6389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6389.46s)

cultural entrepreneurs social entrepreneurs and who will engage in dialogue with each other to create a vision space a possibility space from which people can then create forms institutions and such to actually affect change and i would say we need a tipping point we need a critical mass we don't need everybody we just need enough of us of a certain [6417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6417.659s)

level of consciousness and culture to do this together and i'm speaking in very general terms and i have specifics to it and i see that the professor has stepped off for a second but um i'll stop i'll stop there uh daniel would you like to take the fluorescence the professor oh oh he went to get something gilbert are you ready to respond yes [6460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6460.34s)

um uh i i love everything that uh that uh greg said and the to show you that uh we are on one accord in the last conversation i spoke about alain lot and i wrote a paper on alan locke's interest in uh becoming a diplomat and and uh working for the mandate [6491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6491.159s)

system which preceded the independence movements and allen locke uh he he he made the application but he didn't get the job he had a young understudy named ralph bunch and ralph bunch went ahead and wrote about the mandate system of the belgian [6518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6518.52s)

congo and that was his phd thesis at harvard he then was given a job first in the middle east and then all across africa but ralph uh um allen locke influenced so by the time in 1945 second world war comes around the equity the united nations declaration the notion of the committee of 24 [6544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6544.32s)

came from ralph ellison's work inspired by by came from uh ralph bunches inspired by alan locke and i was writing that article in turks and caicos which gained its international protectorate status along with cayman bvi and and willa and bermuda they came out of the construct set up by alaine locke so there's no question about the [6576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6576.119s)

influence of of black's uh um across the region many of the teachers the the the the principles of what would then call the normal schools uh all over the south and these were parochial schools that were set up in various communities and so on many of them ended up in the caribbean and then a cross-pollination happened many caribbean people during after the um after the first second world war ended up going into the united states and becoming teachers in new york in north carolina and texas and florida and these sorts of places the point about music um is profoundly true and uh uh our your friend our mutual colleague [6627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6627.9s)

the late stanley crouch uh spoke about this in terms of uh blues and jazz and it's uh cross-cultural influence all over the world coming from the caribbean we say the same thing absolutely about bob marley and bob marley's influence across the world as well and so what we but when we these are all points of mitigation [6656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6656.28s)

these are all acts of integrity where the fulfillment of talent right because that's another type of obligation human obligation beyond above apart from race you have the acculturation of people existing within a particular social sphere that gives birth to something like blues or jazz that's true but the talent in the execution of [6687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6687.36s)

talent itself to the point of skill that's a human trait and so that reinstantiates human value in a non-racial way in such a way that a account basing could live in the bahamas air next door to a 10 year old boy and tell him stories about how what he would call they got down in the old days by this time he was in a wheelchair and [6719](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6719.4s)

i used to push him along you were the 10 year old boy yes oh my god man and so and so that influence was there but that influence did not exclude whites right that's right this is what's amazing it did not exclude whites right because they were there as musical arrangers as percussionists as managers as you know also as as as uh um uh beneficiaries listeners to the music and [6752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6752.94s)

so on so you had this influence that exceeded the politics and the sociology of the dominant culture and so i i agree profoundly with that and i think what you have said uh really um aligns well and drives what i have said in the sense that i have said that this is what needs to happen [6778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6778.679s)

and you have said here are examples where it is happening and how has happened and i think you you you read through my book uh the triptych papers yes if you remember at the back of the book i give about six examples of the types of things people are doing a nurse in nigeria who was not only it not only became a [6804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6804.6s)

nurse but a nutritionist and helped to build uh numbers of clinics community clinics and that kind of thing developed a formula and went all over with that tammy sterling a friend of mine in lafayette uh who started a reading group teaching grant marvel collins was a hero so she taught uh these things uh reading to even grandmothers [6833](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6833.159s)

in their 70s and 80s would never read in their lives all right so that work is being done and we all know and that work is cross-racial there are people of every racial stripe that are doing that work and inspired by that work because that work operates at the level of human value not racial uh uh priorities and so these are examples of precisely what i [6862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6862.08s)

think i've been trying to say so i do think uh thomas your remarks brings the entire discussion full circle and so we have what needs to be done what is happening and what more needs to be done and if i think if we operate on that principle what needs to happen now is groups of people in those thousand points of light have got to find a way [6885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6885.9s)

to talk to each other right the young technologists who studied with me um i would they always they often ask me about things and i said to them well listen why don't you make a market mechanisms are very important so why don't you make a list [6909](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6909.78s)

of those businesses which treat their customers including blacks well and appropriately i never saw the point my father trained me in this of going to a restaurant where you were not wanted going to tell where you were not wanted and you know this uh dr king talks about this a little bit uh harry belafonte i had the incredible thing happen at [6936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6936.6s)

george mason university vernon jordan harry belafontean sydney poitier came to george mason uh university um and my mother had always told me that i was beautiful but i don't think that i could win any arguments on that night and um uh harry belafonte said the same thing that you said that paul robeson told him [6963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6963.0s)

sing your music sing your songs get them to sing your songs and when they are singing your songs they have to ask you what deo means what the taliban means right and what daylight comes and we won't go home what does that mean and now you're engaged in a conversation where there's interest and feeling and you've already touched the emotions of that person and so the [6989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=6989.34s)

disposition to conversation has been established and i do think that uh if somehow i resist movements i'm not a movement person although i do think that people acting in their own spheres who on occasion were necessary and the opportunity presents itself [7018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7018.199s)

work in collaboration with each other and if you can build systems that knit together informational platforms that allows me to know what you're doing and others to know what we are doing then this is how you integrate those points of light and achieve an overton window so we are closing now as we are just [7048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7048.86s)

past the two hour mark and i think we had booked for 90 minutes so i'm grateful of everybody's time and attention and really enjoyed that last uh conversation and greg if you can get gilbert and danielle allen to have a conversation and that can have enough time uh that would be fantastic that would be a [7075](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7075.199s)

really really worth having happened and being like well produced and distributed uh i will support that if i can um i really wanted to thank peter for making the space for these for this and the previous one on the stowa because thank you the racial conversations are so you know have been so culture worry and i think the stowe has done such a good job of avoiding culture war and but [7102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7102.8s)

rather than to avoid it here to say how do we lean into where it's hottest in a way that heals it and so i would say like my hope is and i don't know if it is the stowaway's dharma to do this or not that but i hope that some whether it's the store or other places um take the next step in this which is more voices [7125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7125.84s)

and a longer periods maybe some structured agenda and longer periods to unpack the way forward more and uh whoever takes the initiative to do that if i can help i will whether that is with a budget for production and helping to get the capital together or uh helping with sharing it and distribution networks um if peter or anyone feels called to do [7153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7153.02s)

that and i can help i'm here to do so and peter do you have any thoughts you wanted to share before we close it just uh really appreciative of the session uh for you daniel for arranging it and having this conversation for uh gilbert coming in and dropping so much wisdom today um greatly appreciated and uh greg might be returning to the stowa for a secret [7181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7181.099s)

session to continue these conversations uh sometime in february next year so some of the stuff that you were gesturing towards daniel might be happening so uh we'll definitely uh reach out please let me know ahead of time so i can share it and get more people there and if like if there are things where more [7199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7199.4s)

distribution could happen but it takes somebody's man power to do it and we need to pay for that or whatever like i would love to help i actually have it be as meaningful as it can be so yeah please let me know at any parting uh closing thoughts uh for daniel or gilbert before i close up today's session i i would like to say that [7222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7222.32s)

the fact that people have come and stayed here all this time i'm truly humbled by that i have to say and you know i i have a mentor maurice clinton who's one of the most brilliant barristers and every time i think i've caught him i knew i met him when i was 11. and uh there was a period for about 20 years where i spoke to him every night [7250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7250.28s)

and i was always amazed that this great man would take so much time with a young boy and uh um every time i think i've i've i've become i am the the paul was called emilio or the timothy who's called paul he does something very pauline and i realized that i still have a ways to go and he said to me last week um he refers he calls me young prince and he says um never mind that i you know 57 or 58 but he says uh young prince and he says you've spent a lot of time analyzing the old and you've spent a lot of time criticizing the old it is time to stop criticizing the old and to inspire the young and to me um it seems to me that the spirit of this conversation the spirit of the story is that much has happened in our past but nothing will happen in our future if we don't have the right kinds of conversation that can inspire the young [7328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7328.46s)

and so i appreciate that and that is the spirit in which i participate here today um yeah that's a beautiful way to end um thank you for that gilbert we would love to have you uh back here at the stowa from all sessions um and daniel you're always welcome of course uh and for more sessions you can go to the stoa uh dot ca we have one this saturday on uh seeking [7356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzYOybiP7Dg&t=7356.119s)
