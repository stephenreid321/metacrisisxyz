welcome back to future thinkers podcast part 2 of the three part series with daniels franklin berger on the [[generator function|generator functions]] of [[existential risk|existential risks]] in this episode daniel gets into the past and present systems of [[sensemaking]] and choice making that we have as a humanity and how those will need to change as we transition into the future to get all the links and show notes from this episode go to future thinkers org slash [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=20.58s)

let's get into the show welcome to future thinkers org a podcast about the evolution of technology society and consciousness i'm mike gilliland and i'm uv ivanova if you new to the show and you'd like a list of our top episodes and resources go to future thinkers die org slash start and if you like our podcasts leave us a rating and a review on itunes and elsewhere it really helps others find the show and we really appreciate it can we talk about some of the specific examples of the [[generator function|generator functions]] and what they look like in a society okay so i want to look at these same two [[generator function|generator functions]] through a couple different lenses that end up mapping to the same thing but these lenses are valuable so one way of saying what needs to happen [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=107.72s)

is that we need systems of [[collective intelligence]] and collective [[sensemaking]] and choice making that increase with scale effectively and i'll say why that makes sense if you look at jeffery west's work out of santa fe institute this book scale is a classic example we see that you've got productive capacity or intelligence capacity design capacity of a persons [136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=136.769s)

and you bring a few people together and you get increased productive capacity and for a little while you'll actually get an exponential up curve where more people give you a lot more ability because they're sharing new capacities and this is the startup phase or something but pretty soon you get an inflection point where adding more people starts having diminishing returns [154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=154.65s)

per capita and then you get to this table incurring more people is not increasing it up to capacity really at all and so if i have a curve where more people don't keep adding adaptive capacity well then those people will always have an incentive to defect against that system because they'll actually have more adaptive capacity per capita if they defect against it and so [181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=181.68s)

as long as i have a system of [[collective intelligence]] that can not scale with the number of people it can't include everybody right and and it will always force its own collapse its own defection so far we found that all the things that we all like intentionally made human systems countries and companies have this type of curve and so again this [203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=203.82s)

shows why none of those can make it this is a design criteria saying of if i'm making were creating a [[social system]] if it doesn't have [[sensemaking]] in choice making able to increase at least linearly with number of people through some process then the people will defect against that system as soon as you pass the inflection point and now they'll either defect against it make their own [224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=224.31s)

thing completely unless the big system even though it's less efficient per capita than them is still a lot bigger than them and it would take them out in which case it's not safe to overtly defect then they covertly defect they defect with while staying within the system which starts to look like everything you see in the world today where someone looks at okay what is my [243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=243.72s)

particular bonus structure and how can i optimize getting the most bonuses here even though it's not what fits to the company they have now defected against the well-being of the whole because their own incentive and the well-being of the whole are actually ante coupled or at least missed and we can see that almost everywhere people within systems have actually defected against being [268](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=268.56s)

optimally aligned with the integrity of the system they're basically preying on the system in some way and while continuing to look like they're serving it because that's where the incentive is and that's going to of course make the system radically unadapted and speed up the rate of its inevitable decline and so if i could get a system it could scale its actual [289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=289.29s)

adaptive capacity with a number of people that were in the people being in the system would always be better for them and participating with it than defecting against it in covertly or overtly one way of looking at it is of what we have to solve is that [[sensemaking]] in choice making processes fit scale add activity right were the adaptiveness scales number people will [312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=312.78s)

come back to this in a minute as this into being a very central way of thinking about it when we talk about rivalries dynamics creating problems antirattle risk dynamics coherence dynamics of agents with other agents are core to the solutions that we're looking at it also ends up being the coherence what solves a lot of the problems of the open-loop syntax because just how when [333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=333.65s)

we were talking about in democracy the process of making a proposition somebody's sensing something they care about they make a proposition the benefits it but it harms other things that they might not have even been sensing how do we bring all the sensors together to say what is everything important connected to this hold those as design constraints and then go into [350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=350.66s)

an integrated design process that is trying to meet all of those design constraints that sounds like the future of governance but it also sounds like the future of technology design right to make technology that's not externalizing harm and that also means infrastructure design and so coherence between all the agents that are sensing a part of the system means that all the information [369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=369.98s)

from all the parts of the system get to be internalized to the decision-making processes right to the choice making processes which means that externalities get internalized and so interpersonal coherence at scale ends up being a central way of thinking about this now another way of thinking about it is the [[generator function]] of all the extras so one thing we just said is the [[generator function]] is social in coherence right how it was actually what we just said as a [[generator function]] spoke through the language of [[collective intelligence]] this ability to scale another way of looking at it is that the source of all of the risks and also the things that have always sucked the risks are just the things that have always sucked bigger is the relationship between choice and [413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=413.74s)

causation an inappropriate relationship between choice and causation as two types of change and this is going to get into a very tricky philosophic area which is partly why i said the thing that we call science and tech is necessary but not sufficient so science is a theory of causation right when we study law what we're studying the laws of physics or the laws of any domain are [439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=439.88s)

the rules that create change causal chain train and we study and even more curly in computer science computation means rule-based transform and so something is changing it's transforming from one state to another state in a perfectly predictable way governed by a rule set all set so causation not true we don't have a serie of choice which is [464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=464.63s)

why every philosophic conversation gets into free will and determinism and get stuck there and sam harrison dennett debate it out and get nowhere and at the end of the day say we just have different intuitions on this and that's happened since forever in philosophy and we could actually get into that topic at depth at some point does require some nuance to do well but we are making [484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=484.97s)

choices we are at minimum operating as if we were making choices and we are making choices that are extended by text knowledge of causation so before i got the tech and i was just predator i could hit somebody with my fist but then i could understand causation and say the heavier the thing is and the faster it goes and the harder it is very causal principle some more damage it causes and [509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=509.33s)

so i can extend my fist through a stone hammer then i can extend it through a sword right then i can extend it to a gun then i can extend through a and so i'm taking my knowledge of causation science and creating technology applied science that allows my choice still to be extended through levers very powerful levers science is giving me a a theory of causation that can create applied [538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=538.01s)

causation without giving me a theory of choice that tells me how to use that increased causal power and this has been a classic thing in the philosophy of science from the time of descartes that science says what is not what ought that it is the realm of objectives this is but we can't say anything about what ought because we don't deal in objectives and you know through most [559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=559.0s)

interpretations of physicalism the entire thing is meaningless and deterministic anyways and so it just means something that we can't even make sense of well now there's a real in here this is a real problem which his science gives us the ability to understand the physical world very deeply and to create technology that can change the physical world very deeply [582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=582.23s)

and so it is the most powerful avenue for affecting the physical world technology right which is applied science but it has absolutely no compass for how it should do that and not only does it have no compass it says that all compasses are gibberish right because it's gonna be some religious ideas and moral some whatever but they're not science [606](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=606.32s)

they're not objective and we've equated objective with real and subjective with gibberish and the relationship between subjective and object if we don't even really take seriously because we don't know how we don't have good tools for that intellectual tools then we say ok well if technology is the power to change like to create nuclear bombs that can blow up the entire world to [628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=628.82s)

create all kinds of dystopias or all kinds of proto pia's right if it's all this power to do anything what determines how we use that power and it's not natural framework it's not a theory of choice what it ends up being is well who paid for the science who can pay for the tech how did they get the money to pay for the tech remember money as a concentrated choice making system [649](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=649.19s)

so what we end up getting is well capitalism well what that ends up meaning is social darwinism that means [[game theory]] and so when who's [[game theory]] still ultimately guides the development of all the tech and so if we're now get growing [[exponential tech]] with no basis for how to use that other than to keep winning at win-lose games where every time we increase our [670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=670.67s)

technological capacity so do all sides and a multipolar wave so we're just upping the ante it's a playing field this is a very important principle it is impossible to have a kind of technological asymmetric advantage and maintain it indefinitely once you employ it you can maintain it well you don't employ it in which case it's not really a bandage just on the [690](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=690.5s)

potential advantage at the moment that you deploy it then everybody else sees it and it's much easier to copy then it was to do the initial innovation it's easy to iterate and find some other examples of and so all you did was up the playing field which is where he went from one country with notice to lots of countries with nukes and somebody with ai to lots of places where they i and [709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=709.97s)

etc etc right and so the idea well we're gonna develop this technology for our good purpose let's just silly because it's going to be used by all players for all purposes so this is why i call naive techno optimism naive is because could technology solve some problems sure and we addressed loop closure and complicated systems where it's not [734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=734.12s)

externalizing harm somewhere else no and have we recognized that that same technological capacity will be used by everybody for all purposes all purposes that are incented in a system that has a big greatest perversion center all right well that's a problem so the answer is not just that we technology ourselves out of it all right we actually have to change that [754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=754.34s)

underlying basis what that means is ok if we got all this power what should we do with it well how the do we answer that ultimately that's an ethical question it's an existential question and this comes to the forefront we don't like to ask this because we only know physicalism which says this is not even a question right basically physicalism we have a couple different versions and [774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=774.98s)

they all suck right they're all nihilists unless you do some mental gymnastics to try and pretend that they aren't which i would say is not intellectually honest because either i get consciousness is an epiphenomena of brain but that makes it a causal right so that brain is a causally closed physical system where voltage differentials and the brain move [795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=795.17s)

ions across membranes and neurotransmitter goes in one way versus the other so you think you love her or not or had this idea or believed this thing or not and it's all basically controlled by particle physics and your consciousness is epiphenomena for some reason but could not be causal because what is consciousness that is not physics that could causally affect [814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=814.31s)

physics right if physics is causally closed ok so you don't really have choice for your experience of yourself as a choosing agent is ultimately an adaptive illusion which is also a problematic argument because why would it be adaptive to have that thing if that thing doesn't effect causality at all and what is the weird metaphysics of how first-person pops out of [834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=834.86s)

third-person david chalmers speaks about in a very interesting good way when he says ok so you've got a bunch of atoms they're non experiencial and you arrange them in a particular way and experience pops out of it right they've got position and momentum and mass and like that and now we've got like feeling and emotion and it's like a different type of stuff but if i have tools to [853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=853.34s)

study third person i'm gonna find third person because that's my tools right so if my epistemology is measure and then do math across the stuff that i measured i'm gonna come to a belief in the reality is measurable  if i went the buddhism direction and my epistemology was inquire into the nature of my own experience i can do the exact opposite i can say i actually [877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=877.49s)

don't know that there are any particles here i might be dreaming i might be a brain-in-a-vat being stimulated by electrodes i might be a crazy person i might be who the  knows i can't know any of that all i can know so the buddhists send a card to the same thing what can i know for sure prima facie i'm experiencing something but the thing [895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=895.01s)

that i think is i and the thing that i think something might not be what they are but i know for sure is experience so let me explore the nature of my experience and so then of course the the buddhists typically do the opposite reductive move what's real is consciousness in the physical universe is either not real or an epiphenomena and because if my epistemology is to [914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=914.18s)

inquire into the nature of experience but i'm going to come up as realist experience and so what you end up having is epistemology x' that bias ontology x' in our self referential but on the physics side and the physicalism interpretation of physics you get dreadful nihilism or incongruencies and other than that you get weird religious  and we're just not happy with any [938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=938.72s)

of this so we just like try not to think about this too much and we actually can't because we have to actually address what do we want why do we want it what is worth wanting i the attic one stuff that makes their life suck and the little kid who grows up in front of the screen with a bunch of flashing lights wants it again because they were programmed wanted their sovereignty is [959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=959.09s)

hijacked what is worth wanting what actually creates a good life what is good mean right and the fact that we didn't like the bad religious answers for these doesn't mean that we get to throw these questions out completely because you end up getting the [[existential risk]] of where we're at right now which is we don't ask those we just build the tech based on who pays us [977](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=977.57s)

great so we all get to go extinct in a world where we have no theory of choice but we are choosing based on shitty theory of choice prima facie game-theoretic theory of choice and we have a theory of causation so we're extending our shitty choices through [[exponential tech]] and so another way of saying what we have to actually get right is individual and [1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1000.06s)

collective choice making that doesn't suck and another way of thing doesn't suck is individual and collective choice making vit is omni positive or at least vectoring towards omni positive it is omni considerate in terms of considering all that will affect realizing that it's interconnected with all these things and that if i act in a way to beat the other guy i'm engendering his enmity and my [1023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1023.7s)

own insecurity in the future if i'm harming i'm polluting the air i breathe the air and this is where we have to shift all the way down to an identity level which is the idea that i'm a separate thing you're a separate thing over there i can advantage myself independent of you or even at your expense is just actually ontological ii not a well [1044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1044.13s)

formed idea ontologically when i say i i might think i and i've got some idea of what that means a set of atoms contained in a particular boundary that looks like this guy called me he's on my facebook picture and a set of memories whatever but when i think of i usually don't think of all the planets on the biosphere without which i would not exist because there would be no [1068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1068.04s)

atmosphere and i would be dead and i usually don't think about all of the soil bacteria without which the plants wouldn't exist and all of the pollinators and so but i don't exist without all those so if i think about without those it's a ill-formed concept but when i think of that ill-formed concept and i think that it's a good concept to real thing i can think about [1086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1086.91s)

advantaging that are a at the expense of the things that i depend on and that is a kind of insanity but it is a kind of ubiquiti sin sanity currently and so for me to make a choice for me i have to know what the i am and i am not a separate thing in games here at a competition with everything else i am ultimately interdependent with and dependent on so much other than me so [1111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1111.3s)

then i say all right to not debase the world upon which i exist the foundation upon which i exist i start to get i am an [[emergent property]] of this whole thing if there weren't the bacteria and the plants and the pollinators there weren't the people that before that made up the ideas that i believe in the words that i think in and the aesthetics that i perceived through [1135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1135.03s)

if there wasn't gravity and electromagnetism making the whole  thing possible if it wasn't for so much just that i consider other than me i don't exist and so then i get i am an [[emergent property]] of the whole and i am both interconnected with everything and totally unique within it and for you and as soon as i get that i get a couple things because we're totally [1159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1159.84s)

interconnected i cannot advantage myself at your expense in a real way i only can if i haven't factored loop closure everywhere but the way that i harm you is gonna end up being an open loop that is going to harm the substrate of what they care about and when i factor all the closed loops we get to david bombs the evolution of wholeness this whole thing [1179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1179.22s)

the evolution of wholeness the the the schrodinger equation of the whole thing right am i evolving in its complexity so i can't advantage myself at your expense in a meaningful way and now so i can't understand myself without understanding myself through the my interactions with you and your feedback and reflection so choice we have to have a theory of choice it comes from a philosophy that [1206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1206.159s)

can actually relate choice and causation and can have a theory of causation and a theory of choice that are inter commensurable with each other right it's not a made-up kind of theory of choice and it can serve as a basis for how to make good choices in the presence of all of the technology we have and that there's something we said last time we're together is the technology is [1229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1229.47s)

because it's a causal extension of our choice has us extending our power to be like the power of gods the ability to create new life forms of genetic engineering to destroy whole life forms and species to blow things up at like nuclear bombs are bigger than juices lightning bolts was depicted or i'd like the power of gods if you do not get the love and wisdom and consideration of [1254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1254.19s)

gods as a choice making basis for that power you'll use that power in just a good ways that will end up causing self-destruct on a very tiny plane and if i want to make choices that are good for me and i'm interconnected with the whole i have to make choices that are good for the whole and that means i have to understand that i'm not a separate thing and i have to be able to [1274](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1274.59s)

progressively consider my relationship with everything the impact of my choices and be on everything and be able to internalize the things that would have been externalities into my choice making process and not just at an individual level but at a group level we're doing group process and this becomes the future of design as opposed to the open-loop harm externalizing method that [1302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1302.42s)

we've had is how do we have progressively more omni considerate design that is more omni positive that is a safe vessel for the level of effect that is the idea of us being separate from the world in many ways it's modern because if you look at how some of the what we call primitive tribes looked at themselves and considered themselves it was not the same they considered [1325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1325.92s)

themselves a lot more connected with everything or just a small part of the whole but like you said those tribes a lot of them got killed by the other tribes who considered themselves as more separate and so how we place our sense of agency and where we place our sense of what is us and what is not us actually has a very significant effect on the outcomes and i think that in the [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1355.38s)

modern world a lot of people don't even realize that this sense of separation between self and world is a construct that because we have certain definitions you know scientific definitions or whatever of where body ends and the environment begins but if you start deconstructing that and you can do it through any number of things like just intellectually deconstructing it or in [1381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1381.48s)

deep meditation looking at where like your sense of self ends and sense of the world begins it just breaks down that sense of self is very strong and maybe it is because capacity to affect the environment is so much higher now with technologies and all these tools that kind of have become the extension of ourselves maybe that's part of the reason why people are so attached to [1407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1407.69s)

their sense of self because they actually see the effect so strongly whereas in the past people would see the effects of nature a lot more strongly than the effects of themselves i think it's strong because of the dynamic of experience in time you know you don't see the direct results of your actions coming back to you after a long time until they become external and [1428](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1428.42s)

separate and then when they come back at someone else or something else affecting you in a way you don't want to be affected but you don't loop it back to your original actions this is something i've been thinking about quite a lot as you've been talking daniel is this sort of natural experience that people have and how these theories might contradict those natural experiences even though [1450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1450.17s)

the natural experience is incorrect how do we communicate these concepts in a way that even though it can conflict with someone's day to day minute-by-minute experience but i could cause them to think differently and expand their identity but people's experience is also dictated by their concepts you know like those two things affect each other because when people [1472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1472.06s)

have an idea about how a certain thing is they tend to experience it in a way that is consistent with that idea mmm true so if we look at the tribes that had more of a there's a web of life and we're a strand in it few that we were mentioning long ago they had a informal theory of choice they might have had some moral or ethical principles this was not like a formal systems of [1501](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1501.08s)

formalized ethics but they had some theory and they had a very weak theory of causation they saw diseases happened by like ghosts and obviously didn't know how to work with tech all that well and etc so they didn't make it through with other people that understood causation better and so the causation leads to physical adaptive advantage and there's a theory of choice it's just a theory of [1527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1527.78s)

choice called win out win those games right game there's only theory of choice it's just that that theory is tapping out right that theory itself leads to its own self-determination ones because as the power keeps getting larger it becomes more than you can keep winning at all we said this before the win-lose eventually becomes lose-lose omni lose lose when [1548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1548.559s)

you have levels of war that nobody can win when you have tragedy of the commons that are completely ruined commons you know when you those types of dynamics when you have an information ecology that's so broken from the incentive to dissing form that nobody has any idea what the is true so you either figure out how to create omni win-win as a new solution against win-lose other [1568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1568.94s)

than members or you get omni lose-lose as the inevitable byproduct of trying to keep winders and it's funny because there's this very mythopoetic way of thinking about what we're talking about that is otherwise a very kind of just technically clear thing you know we said scaling to get the power of gods we have to have love wisdom of god's a guy that similarly we say we either create [1589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1589.82s)

omni win-win or we get omni lose-lose it sounds a lot like heaven or hell on the other side of purgatory and we get some hard choices to make and we might even ask if maybe those stories had were metaphors for seeing hey we're making choices that we kept getting more powerful that this would be problematic and you know not just the heaven and hell and purgatory story but we're in a [1613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1613.97s)

kali yuga and you know satya is the next phase there's there's a lot of these stories that in a joseph campbell like way we can say like oh that's actually a very interesting way to think about where we're at right now but we can't depend on jesus to come back and solve it or aliens to come fix it for us or a fifth dimensional library from the galactic center or whatever it is we [1635](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1635.45s)

have to actually become that jesus for those aliens we have to actually become a being that has the right capacity to make the right choices and you know do the right [[sensemaking]] the right choice making so it is true that it being this a shit-ton more effective at good choice making needs to comes all these things then the types of beings we've been it's just we have to become them and with [1658](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1658.58s)

regard to mike your question on what experiences are natural obviously it's natural for me to think in english not mandarin but if i grew up in china i would think in mandarin and that would be natural and because i think in english i have certain constructs of thought linguistically that are related to the syntax of english that if i thought in [1680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1680.94s)

mandarin would be different my aesthetic would be different and if i grew up in the plane to the sioux indians what would be natural to me would be different and my identity ethics aesthetics etc so this is very conditioned now in the modern world where we experience rubik wit ously feeling separate we also experienced a bit courtesy feeling alone and lonely [1703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1703.859s)

not just alone be lonely and we can see that loneliness as a major source of depression anxiety and ultimately even suicidal impulse is pretty much ubiquitous in the developed world we say is that a natural experience well it's certainly a new bit courtesy conditioned one was there ever a person in an indigenous tribe throughout the history two and a half million years of hominid [1728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1728.309s)

history or turn fifty thousand years of homo sapien history that felt lonely not that much you live in a tribe with 150 people that know every thing about you that you've known forever and that you can fully depend on you know everything about them and you got no you know secrets and lonely it's not really a thing right and separate from them is not really a thing and so we say natural [1747](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1747.96s)

i think what you mean is conditioned ubiquitously then you have to say alright so humans are more susceptible to being conditioned by their environment than most creatures obviously a dog that grows up in the wild or captivity is going to be different but we're even more susceptible because and this is a really important thing to understand about [1766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1766.71s)

sapiens the gorilla or the chimp that's close to us can grab onto its mom's fur in the first five minutes while she moves around and we can't even move our head for three months and a horse is going to get up and walk in 20 minutes and it takes us a year and just to have a real sense like to do the calculation how many 20 minutes fit into a year to get how many multiples it takes us to be [1790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1790.259s)

adaptive in the most simple way and we're like well we are embryos for an extraordinarily long of time we're helpless for an extraordinarily long period of time why is that well because the horse comes kind of pre-programmed how to be a horse it's gonna be a horse pretty much the same from generation to generation in a while and so it coming pre-programmed [1809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1809.379s)

works because it adapted to fit its environment and so then it can hold the code of how to be adaptive in relationship to its environment but it used to be really adaptive to throw spears and probably none of us are all that good at throwing spears and we're pretty adaptive because we like text and podcasts and that they didn't do because what's adaptive for us changes [1829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1829.629s)

pretty rapidly because unlike the other creatures that are the product of their environment we are as tool evolvers creatures that not only go and exploit every miche gorillas didn't leave and go find islands and be in the water and go to the arctic and right like they adapted to a niche we went and found every niche and then we made new niches right we made cities and treehouses and [1852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1852.129s)

all kinds of as a result we had to learn how to adapt to the new world that we were in because we were gonna keep creating new worlds finding and creating new worlds so as babies were born pretty much open to just start imprinting what world of my end and how do i not have a genetic program to do this but how do i connect tomic lis program to be able to do this but it's not just in childhood [1876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1876.129s)

cuz we can change stuff so fast as the whole tribe might get up and leave and go somewhere else we went from gathering to farming or to hunting right like something super different this is why we need adult neuroplasticity to be able to change our kind of basal orientation even later in life and so we are radically affected by our environments and it's part of our adaptive advantage [1896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1896.709s)

and we are mostly affected by our social environments by what the other people around us are paying attention to in doing and what the nature of the relationships are like you'll notice that mostly now people live in nuclear family homes on their own don't interact with other people all that much and then they spend all their time addictively looking at other people on screens they [1916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1916.569s)

watch tv and their watch people and then they go to facebook and they look at people and they read news articles about people they're fascinated by people but then we're conditioned currently to both suck at interacting with people too capitalism has largely been a way not needing each other directly and being able to indirectly inter mediate [1934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1934.87s)

needing each other through money right so the money can just buy whatever i need so i don't actually have to have friends or neighbors or you know give a  about anybody or have anyone give a  about me and that seems really convenient and everybody is in a crisis of loneliness at home looking at people hoping that they're getting likes which are not real relationships this is [1953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1953.83s)

basically sugar rather than nutrients this is porn rather than a real relationship this is a [[hypernormal stimuli]] having co-opted real stimuli but also having desensitized us to real stimuli well being comprehensively bad for us so in he'll asked how could people have a different experience realizing that we are conditioned by our environment to think in words of a [1976](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1976.12s)

certain language to experience in a certain way i could say lots of things that won't matter i could say go spend more time in nature but nobody will do it we both know other people listen to podcast nobody will do it maybe one time and then their life is busy and they will be the product of their amount again very largely and because the [1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=1992.59s)

relationship with us here was a tiny part of all of the relationships that were influencing and so i could say go spend time in nature and i could say you have some good psychedelic journeys and you know do this kind of breathwork and contemplate that the atoms that make up your body where plants not that long ago i but there would just be nice words to say that wouldn't perfecting people that [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=2013.83s)

much if you want to ask how could people really change their experience only thing i can say that is statistically really going to work is immerse yourself in an environment that makes that likely around people that are doing them so if you went and lived as a tribe for a while in the amazon you go live with the ottawa or something you will experience the world differently before a couple [2034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=2034.919s)

weeks passes you will start hearing things in a different way experiencing yourself in a different way feeling a connection to people in a different way and if you even change the group of people you're hanging out around at what they're motivated by and what they think about and you change the quality of your relationships with them you will end up changing the basis of what seems like [2054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWpKVTyx8R0&t=2054.57s)
