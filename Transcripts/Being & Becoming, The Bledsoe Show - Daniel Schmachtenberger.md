welcome to the blitz oh show does your host mike bledsoe and today's guest is daniel smacking burger he's an evolutionary philosopher systems designer and strategist there's a special show because i bring to him some things that are on my mind that i'm working with and working through and he helps me see things on a deeper level and unravel some truths that are within myself he does this regularly for me [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=23.13s)

when i say regularly i mean every few months i seem to have some type of question that he is extremely skilled at helping me see a different perspective on and i think he will help you see a different perspective as well additionally he is the guy who created qualia that's the no tropic i go on and on about all the time and a co-founder of the neuro hacker collective so if you [48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=48.51s)

like what he has to say you might want to try as product out too so if you do want to do that go to neuro hacker.com and add that qualia product to your cart use the coupon code bledsoe 15 and you'll get 15% off i highly recommend just going over to the website and doing some reading whether you're gonna buy the product or not there's a lot of really cool stuff over [70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=70.95s)

there beyond just nootropics there's a lot of cool discussions that that if you do dig what we talked about here you're gonna dig what they've got going on over there additionally one other thing make sure to go over to itunes give us five stars positive comment please and helps this podcast reach more people enjoy the show music daniel good to have you good to be here with you my friend i'm looking for today's conversation every time we have a conversation i leave feeling like i definitely having learned definitely having learned and today we're gonna dig into being versus doing i think a lot of people one of the reasons i want to bring this up is this is something i've been working on myself and being in a [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=128.039s)

culture and society where so much value is putting on what we do and even when i'm asked or we ask children what do you want to be when you grow up they the answer ends up being a doing answer versus a being answer even though the question is being and so we get this association you know what do you want to be when you grow up it's like oh i want to be and then they name the job which [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=156.75s)

is interesting something that's come to my attention recently i watch kids only be a firefighter or an astronaut that seems like a very doing thing would you agree that that's that's just how our culture has been molding us up to this point oh yeah and it goes deeper than that not only is it a doing thing it's one very specific specialist role and it's a specialist role that is usually [186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=186.57s)

related to how they're gonna make money and so it's what do you want to be when you grow up first it takes them out of the moment into the future it takes them into wanting to develop who they are right in the framing of their essence as a job so you can look at how that is the effect of macroeconomics forming people to be effective cogs in that system there's a [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=212.13s)

whole bunch of things going on right being in doing is definitely one of them as you're as you're exploring that inquiry yourself if we reframe it to something like who do you want to be rather than what do you want here what do you want to do what the what comes up for you as meaningful answers to that i want to be honest trustworthy want to be a community be an [239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=239.91s)

asset to the community and and that things like that things more along the lines of characters or not characters but yeah what what uh what's the value of my character am i i somebody who tells the truth things like that and how does it relate for you to what that character is doing what is the relationship those qualities of being and doing it's some but it's something i [272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=272.73s)

can do it's something i can be right now it's not uh it's not even it's something that aspire to as it as choice you know i can just i want people to trust me then i know that i need to behave with integrity there's a number of embedded dialectics or dichotomies here there's now versus later so you said this is something i can be now versus something that's [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=305.72s)

aspirational in the future and there's something that is more around qualities of character versus specific types of action someone can show up with integrity as a artist or as an inventor or as a entrepreneur or as a mother right lots of different roles and those roles are meaningful they are deep and meaningful to who that unique being and their expression and their dharma and [331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=331.699s)

their purposes and then there's also the difference between the qualities of character of how other people feel in relationship with them and their own quality of experience how they've experienced life yeah and so when you look at the fact that we have choice over our own experience and we also have choice over how we affect the experience of others right all of that kind of [355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=355.94s)

shows up here so there's something around optimizing the relationship between all these dialectics our own acting in ways that optimize our own experience and the experience of everyone and everything that we touch in effect showing up right now in the fullest way we can now and in a way that optimizes our growth trajectory into the future and qualities of being and [379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=379.13s)

specific types of doing that are both aligned with each other and the deepest aspect of who we are yeah i think it's challenging sometimes to think about what it is that we do i find that sometimes there's a challenge between who we are or who we want to be and who were showing up how was showing up in the world for others and i've had conversations with others and then i've [410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=410.0s)

had this internal conversation with myself around am i showing up for the purpose of am i doing this i tell myself and i've watched other people tell themselves they're doing this because they love other people like i'm doing doing this out of love when in reality it's the motivation is born out of out of need in that if i am not this way or i don't behave this way or i [441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=441.5s)

don't do these things then this person won't love and accept me and so we end up in this we end up in this place where i either have to behave the way other people want me to behave in order to be liked or i do whatever i want to do and no one's gonna like me i can't do both that seems to be a reality that's being created for a lot of people and a reality i've had to wrestle with myself [471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=471.17s)

so we have more things where you have two different things that are both meaningful framed as being dichotomous right so you have your individuality and your authenticity and your sovereignty on one side which is who do i really just want to be for myself and this is prima facie meaningful right obviously meaningful and then you have the relationship connection communion side [502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=502.81s)

which is how do i show up in a way that is enriching to other people so that they also want to show up with me because this so much of what's meaningful that only expresses itself interpersonally which is obviously also meaningful if we believe that there is an inexorable that cauda me between those where we have to sacrifice who we actually are for a relationship or [530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=530.18s)

sacrifice relationship to be who we are then life will suck and it's not actually true it is true that those are poles but they're poles that are actually complementary and when navigated properly are symbiotic with each other that you being who you actually are and you relating with other people in the way that creates most meaningful relationship are symbiotic [553](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=553.77s)

now you might be in a relationship with someone where they want you to behave a certain way because you kind of made that contract with them where from the beginning you acted a way that you thought that they wanted that was never true to who you were to get something from them where the whole thing is a bullshit commodities exchange but that just might be an unauthentic [569](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=569.52s)

relationship to begin with would you say that a lot of people have that relationship with their parents sure defect though most people have that relationship with their parents if their parents weren't really focused on facilitating those people being who they actually authentically were which is not most parents right and so then they are being who they think their parents need [590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=590.76s)

them to be and this is why they don't like going home for the holidays right now there's then one can rebel and say i'm gonna be whoever the fuck i want to be and lose connection or they can sacrifice who they are and their authenticity in a codependent way for a connection that isn't real connection at pseudo connection or they can see what is the authentic overlap between who my [621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=621.72s)

parents actually are who i actually am what is the what is the overlap of that venn diagram that's authentic and let's see how we can explore that let's see how we can expand it yeah what what would you say to somebody who say grew up and i was just talking someone earlier today who grew up in the mormon religion and then they leave that religion and when we look at that venn [647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=647.55s)

diagram there's really not a lot of overlap or maybe there is overlap but it's it's very difficult to find how do you go how do you go about do we do we'd need to reconcile those relationships is that something that we owe other people so we talked about being i environment i think you do to where the new the relationships that are new are easy to get into because we're showing [678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=678.209s)

up as our most authentic selves more than we ever have before and so there's you start the relationship without the bullshit but a relationship that where you grew up with it and now is it something worth cutting away later on in life and cutting people out or is it something do we ople something i think there's another way to ask if [706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=706.73s)

that's more insightful it's not do we owe our parents in obligatory false relationship which is not actually very meaningful for anyone or on the other side do we just cut it out i think one meaningful question is as we are interacting with our parents can we feel comfortable being who we are hmm without needing their approval and without needing them to understand us and agree [738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=738.529s)

with us and can we let them be who they are and even if they can't even if they don't have a worldview maybe they think we're gonna burn in hell or they think whatever it is right can we accept them get them where they're at and be who we are or do we go into some trigger where we think we need to change who we are for them or we need to change who they are and to the degree that that trigger [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=761.18s)

arises is there an evolutionary opportunity for us to heal that and are they a really good mirror for showing us where those triggers live inside of us i've been that conversation with people before too is like you think you're you think you're enlightened or whatever you want to call it let's go hang out your family and they'll show you it's a very classic statement that yeah if people [785](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=785.0s)

are focused on some kind of [[personal development]] one good measure is if you hang out with your parents the degree to which you can be authentically you and at peace around them without trying to convince them of anything and let them be who they are without being triggered on who they are is a good measure for how you've come yeah that's powerful because they pretty much installed the [809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=809.54s)

triggers yes so this is why it's such a deep mirror for the triggers you know they are for you yeah which is why you disproportionately react to them in a way that nobody else does right other people won't see them like whatever it's it's irritating it's cute it's no big deal and you're freaking out about it is because all of your trauma you know has history there and to the degree you've [832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=832.73s)

healed your trauma it's not so getting pushed yeah and to the degree you haven't seeing it shows you where you're gonna work yeah so coming back to i just want to dive in just the definition of this which is we talked about states of being and and i personally been looking at you know doing versus being and you know i think a lot of us in the western culture [859](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=859.58s)

consider we go oh if i do these things then i'll be this person and then we do those things and then we and we gonna become a piece of this person we thought we would become once we do these things and now we have to do more things in order to feel good and i've been investigating the possibility of going straight to being and then once you become the person that you want to be or [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=886.49s)

the person you were you remember the person you were before you were imprinted you become this person that has that is this being and this being just does the things that they're supposed to do or it just unfolds easily so a lot of my focus has been around how can i be different without focusing on the doing first and then coming from a lifetime of being taught that you do to [915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=915.5s)

become and now i'm going in reverse going okay i want to be different and i need to go and and can the motivation and is the motivation pure it's like do i want to be so that i can do and in which case is that even possible or do it do i need to have the pure motivation of look i want to be for the purpose of being and being authentic and then i need to trust [944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=944.69s)

trust them the uncertainty of what that looks like when the doing happens mm-hmm there's a bunch of elements kind of wrapped up in there let's let's pull them apart and see if we can address them i'd actually like to address the topic of dichotomy and paradox a little bit more essentially because it's right at the heart here of is being really what we care about we actually care [974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=974.1s)

about who we are character-wise or we care about our state of experience right and all the doing is really just so we can be happy or good or something and if we're there already then how do we have any idea what we would do and who cares and does it matter or is doing really relevant because we're actually evolving the world and we have a role to play and what is the relationship between those [994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=994.74s)

and is there causal influence both ways does doing affect being and being effect doing and can they be recursive and so think about this very simple analogy but the analogies illustrative to think about a cylinder a cylinder is a three dimensional object it's a very simple three dimensional object we're used to thinking in three dimensions three spatial dimensions so it's an easy thing [1022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1022.459s)

to think about but if you imagine a two dimensional creature right a plane on plane or creature they can't see a cylinder they can see a two-dimensional slice of it now there's an infinite number of two-dimensional slices since they're infinitely thin that stack on top of each other to actually make the thing up so they're actually reducing the total information of what that is [1043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1043.88s)

infinitely right one dimension reduction is infinite right reduction so they slice the cylinder one way and they get a circle and it's very clear that the reality they're seeing it's kind of passing through their space as a circle if it passed through perpendicular to that they'd get a rectangle right the other and a cross-section from a two-dimensional perspective like is the [1067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1067.91s)

cylinder a rectangle a circle well it's obviously whichever one is happening like it being a circle is true it's very clear that from a two-dimensional perspective like that is what is being seen it's true if there's the perfect fidelity to it right from the other direction as a rectangle it's also perfectly true and those two descriptions of reality in two [1092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1092.07s)

dimensions cannot commensurate right they are disparate mutually exclusive descriptions of circles is totally round thing rectangles these corners and so then what are the opportunities well you can either just say i saw a circle so i know it's circle and the other side is just wrong mm-hmm that's fundamentalism which is kind of like there's some truth and i'm sticking to it right and i'll [1114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1114.73s)

fight with the people on the other side or you see the circle and then you for some how you happen to be on the other plane and see the rectangle too and you go shit there's seemingly truth to both of these now i have embraced paradox what do i do with this and you have different options one way as you say well maybe there's a middle path but you're still trying to reconcile in two [1134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1134.02s)

dimensions cuz you're two dimensional creature so you say well what's kind of in the middle of a circle and a rectangle and you get a rounded rectangle now you kind of round the corners of the rectangle make it a little more circular like now that isn't even partially true right like that isn't even a little bit of any part of a cylinder or you just say well they're [1150](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1150.43s)

both true and neither are true and we embrace paradox and that just means you gave up on understanding its really what it means the truth is a cylinder is a very straight forward thing which is a circle translated over the space of a rectangle or a rectangle rotated to the space of a circle but you can't understand it in duty you can only understand it in 3d which means you need [1174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1174.76s)

an entirely higher dimensional framework of understanding to get the nature of reality when you're trying to reduce reality to a dimensionally smaller perspective you're fucked right because that dimension simply can't understand it so then you have false paradox because the the perspective the view itself is reducing the total reality and you can even see just looking at the [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1196.33s)

east side of a building versus the west side you could argue over what the building looks like and it's because perception is inherently reductive you cannot see the whole of what something is because there's many many different views of it right so you need a trans perspectival understanding that can reconcile them so the the reality of the cylinder is [1215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1215.04s)

different than circle or rectangle but both of those are partially true from that kind of perspective well when we come to many existential questions it seem paradoxical or dichotomous like being and doing is what really matters my state of being in the moment or was is what matters my state of becoming and that i'm becoming more and more right being side says outside of time and am i [1244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1244.96s)

touching the infinite am i touching the eternal am i in wholeness my own fullness now becoming side says universe itself is evolving am i evolving with universe am i adding to universe and my self actualizing and realizing right circle rectangle these are both true but we're not just saying well it's both a circle and a rectangle we have to put those together and say how are they both [1272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1272.29s)

true how do being and becoming reconcile in that way and they the key thing to get and we can see all the other dichotomies that come with this based on the being model it's well i'm gonna love and accept myself exactly how i am i'm gonna love and accept others in reality exactly how it is i'm gonna see the beauty and everything right now on the becoming side you're like well i want to [1293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1293.56s)

make myself better i want to help make others better i want to make the world better right well which one is it do i want to love what is or do i want to make it better this is exactly the struggle i think i've been having and that i go through phases where i'm going through accepting and then i'm going i'm going you know what i need to really step it up yeah and there's things that [1317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1317.11s)

need to change and i want to i want to see the progress and and see the evolution and then i it's almost as if i get caught up and pushing the ball forward and then i feel as though my state of being there's static line and then i have to go back to accepting things just as they are and in that state of being so this is as fascinating to me is i've been living [1348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1348.45s)

i've been living a life where i'm switching between truths right because i can't reconcile the two so we can be in a place or we flip flop between truths that both are self evidently true and yet see mun reconcilable or we can reconcile and live them both more fully simultaneously but we have to go higher dimensional to do that we have to go to a place where they can really reconcile [1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1377.16s)

and that requires and higher-dimensional here isn't spacial dimensions it's how we understand the complexity of reality so we're gonna get to i'd like to add another element of a model because it'll really help with this and i think i think might find interesting i want to compare for a minute roughly generalized very oversimplified an eastern model and a western model of the [1403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1403.31s)

nature of reality and meaning and spirituality obviously it's oversimplified because there's a lot of eastern models and a lot of western models and the delineation between them isn't clear at all but let's just take by eastern i mean they kind of vedantic buddhists the primary interpretations which are very being focused and we're using these as a reference for for this [1427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1427.89s)

particular dichotomy here so you notice in most interpretations the buddhist tradition the focus is exclusively on being right not doing not becoming in fact any chop wood carry water doing is just because if that needs done do it but it's all about the quality of being while doing it it's the only thing that matters the reason why or one of the reasons why [1454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1454.11s)

that becomes insightful is the buddhists and the hindu vedanta model of time is a circular model of time all right they have this system of time called the culpas or the egos where where the time and universe itself is believed to cycle cycle through birth and death so you know if you if you think about it these people watch nature very deeply and they saw seasons spring and fall and they saw [1478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1478.32s)

empires rise and then fall they saw people born and then die they saw relationships come together and come apart and they just saw everything cycling they watched the precession of the equinoxes they saw cycles within cycles days within months within years within galactic cycles right so they saw it was all cycles and so because of that if everything cycling and then then they [1502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1502.23s)

extend that up to but this is just a intellectual extension everything in universe is just cycles then nothing is actually going anywhere we're just going in circles there is no actual thing called progress it's just the wheel of time right so they have this concept of the wheel of time so so if you're trying to push something forward you're just moving to the cycle more quickly you've [1523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1523.95s)

bought into the illusion that you're going anywhere right that spring means anything other than its way towards fallen death right mm-hmm and so this is why then they talk they talk about it as maya right illusion or even more some sort of suffering so then if it's just this fucking loser e wheel it isn't actually going anywhere going further is [1546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1546.57s)

meaningless so then there's actually a movie samsara on netflix you can watch which is just yeah it's demonstrating that if you want to go see it that concept to concept right and so then the goal there becomes getting off the wheel and so that means getting out of time in the concept of linear time completely so then the goal [1571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1571.29s)

is being able to access the eternal through the now and so the idea of becoming or of progress or making the world better when the whole thing is illusory to begin with meaning fundamentally to begin with just means you bought into the illusion you don't get the ultimate truth so the goal there is is to step out of time to be now full complete in a way that doesn't have [1599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1599.4s)

progress built in at all mm-hmm right and that's the kind of pure zenith of a being model you notice that happiness in that model is a model of happiness it's like contentment or serenity like fullness right now with what is right and in fact anything like passion or desire or excitement is called the cause of all suffering right because that means that you believe something good is [1623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1623.97s)

in the future so you sacrifice being in the moment for wanting something in the future and that just leads you to getting all feverish and fucked up and then when you get it you weren't even that happy and you want something else and then you're anxious of losing it so just don't desire anything don't have passion or anything just be full and content now all right this is also yeah [1639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1639.87s)

this is great because this is also something i've been i've been studying you know like how do i be and then how do i and then also it's hard to not believe that my passion and my my drive in my just my desires are for nothing well they in that model they are for nothing that isn't a losery and stupid right right they they are for plenty of sound and fury leading to suffering and [1672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1672.65s)

nothing and so that's that model but that is circle right that it's kind of true but it's so far from true that it's just actually infinitely off okay i'm so far from the whole truth it's a dimensional reduction so then let's look at the western model so everyone think it sounds boring it can sound boring but of course then the idea of boring in that model would be a mental trap and [1697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1697.08s)

that when you come into the fullness of being right now you can access and this is true a state of serenity that has a kind of blissfulness to it it doesn't need you to do anything and that is unperturbed well so be like no you actually don't get what the fullness of being and you drop into it is right that is eternal and that's unfuck with abel so that's that [1723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1723.43s)

now the western model of time kind of originating judaism we can say and then the greeks and modern science and you know i've told most of the world now because early jews were very focused on history and noticing their kind of progression as a as a people new technology as it emerged and new law and new ideas and etc they and they were recording that they were actually [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1754.69s)

noticing net change over time and that new things were emerging that didn't exist before and so rather than focusing on the cycles and in nature and seeing everything as cyclic they were focused on the emergence of things humans were creating that were additive and actually going somewhere and so they had a linear model of time so time was actually going somewhere and so that led to a dialectic [1775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1775.72s)

of progress and a focus on becoming more than being then that in that model there is their what i've seen is there's a beginning and an end maybe or maybe not sometimes there is a beginning and an end and maybe the beginning is the beginning of universe in genesis maybe the beginning is when you were born maybe the end is heaven right there's different kind of [1803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1803.59s)

theological x' they can disagree about where the beginning and the end is they can even have a reincarnation model within it but that there isn't that progress along the whole thing right because universe itself is actually going somewhere and so you're going somewhere within it and you're adding to universe going somewhere well if you're if you think universe is actually going [1823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1823.75s)

somewhere then adding to universe going somewhere is inherently meaningful and you being part of where it's going is inherently meaningful so then just being in the moment is not that interesting becoming evermore in a universe that is itself becoming evermore so developing oneself right in which case being just completely content in a way that has no drive is is antithetical to what's [1848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1848.41s)

purposeful so you notice their definition of happiness has a lot more it sounds like passion and excitement right right and which way you were to look at if you look at those cultures there's a lot of singing dancing you know even partying whereas you look at some of the more eastern philosophies and it's things very quiet and and it's the traditions are that i that i that [1876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1876.56s)

i'm that i'm imagining right now like a tea ceremony yeah very just it's very calm not a lot of excitement very bland or vanilla well you're giving a western bias here so you're calling it boring and bland and vanilla sure they would say profoundly serene i'm am i insulting people that come from that perspective you think well probably but what's more what's more interesting is that you're [1907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1907.6s)

not getting it yet right because you haven't you haven't dropped into that place of getting it but you probably have if you think about it you might have had moments where you're surfing and you stopped and everything kind of stops and you just see sparkles on the water and thinking about what's coming next stops and the moments full mm-hmm and it's more full in a certain quality [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1926.39s)

than excitement about the future is yeah there's no doubt about that i've definitely had moments right staying there so the whole eastern process would be staying there right each moment being fully with that need the endless wave except it doesn't it's about it independent of circumstance right it's some you're in the eye of the storm no matter what's happening around you you [1956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1956.27s)

keep your peace yeah a part of the enlightenment and that model is being able to be fully with what is no matter what is no matter what is happening because everything that's happening is in illusion right it's all just changing and flexing but the consciousness that's witnessing it is ever-present and identifying as that and that that is actually the fullness right that the [1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=1979.49s)

light is actually the light of consciousness that's what waking up means there now so if one wanted to bias from that direction they could look at the other thing with all the singing advancing and say look how feverish it is hmm look at how kind of immature and it's excitement when things go well and disappointment things don't go well look at how little [2003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2003.09s)

sovereignty that people have where they're so affected by their environment and their circumstance look at how they rush around trying to change their circumstance to make themselves happy look at how attached they get to other people and how fucked up they get when things don't go the way they want look at how unhappy they are when they lose something look at how when they get what [2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2019.26s)

they want they're only happy for like 15 minutes and then they want something else and that there's like almost nothing of seeming enduring depth there right now these are both true right so we're talking about circles and rectangles so to just finish a little bit on the on the western model so time is going somewhere dialectic of progress so the focus becomes purpose because [2043](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2043.5s)

purpose is a time bound concept purpose unfolds in time right and evolution is a time bound concept and so evolving ourselves evolving others evolving the world around us becoming more being able to express more of infinite potential through the finite through time work and and in there in that model it would say well of course when you get what you wanted you aren't just enduring ly happy [2068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2068.97s)

because then you would stop becoming the goal is to be becoming forever the goal is actually to be in the process of blossoming at the depth what universe is the evolutionary impulse that brings subatomic particles together into particles and particles into you know higher order particles into biology the whole thing from the big bang on that that that what keeps organizing universe [2089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2089.37s)

towards more orderly complexity is a becoming impulse an infinite blossoming into higher order potential of universe and that you resulted from that and you also have the ability to choose in a way that aligns yourself with that and so of course when you get something then you're not you're happy for a moment because you're in the becoming but it's actually the being in the becoming [2112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2112.41s)

that's what's interesting right what tear chardin called the lore of becoming but because it's about becoming and it's also ever every moment right and so there it's more about excitement passion you know associated with becoming now what's interesting when you put these together you have a circular model of time and a linear model corresponding [2140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2140.38s)

with the circular is being with the linear is becoming with the circular as presence with the lanier's purpose with the circular is contentment serenity in the fullness of the now and with the linear is passion and purpose and the promise of possibility you notice that the circular model maps to the serotonin like happiness and the serotonergic systems right and the linear model maps [2167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2167.23s)

to dopamine right and the dopamine kinds of happiness like processing and that the practices are tying this to the there are transmitters this brings so much application and if anyone knows anything about how those things are impact or if you've had experiences where you had an excess and dopamine or serotonin right and it's like oh that's why those experiences were it that way [2198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2198.88s)

people have interesting people who've explored it might resonate with thee they took a serotonin urja faint right they took mdma and they became very in the moment very sensory very feeling very in the fullness of everything being overwhelmingly beautiful now yeah almost no awareness of other than now okay someone took dopaminergic thing right they took adderall or cocaine or [2222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2222.01s)

whatever they become profoundly focused on what they wanted to create and they all they wanted to do is be in the process of creating it right and we can see the beauty and the crashes of both of those and what becomes more available and less available in both of those we can see them the practices right a lot of the eastern practices are serotonin erick practices being in the moment [2246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2246.13s)

breathing slow being nature having all of your awareness your sensory awareness and what is a lot of the western practices are create goals achieve the goals feel good that you achieved them check them off reinforce having goals create more goals check ray and those are dopaminergic practices now if we come back to our 2d 3d technology i mean dopamine is addiction yeah right [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2272.95s)

dopamine dopamine and its relationship with opioids the dopamine opioid system is feels good do it again because it is time-bound what things were evolutionarily relevant to do again right nobody said in terms of addicted to serotonin if you're having an experience that is more about being in the moment you're not jonesing for the next moment [2293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2293.83s)

right that would explain why people tend to get hooked on something like cocaine and maybe mdma is not as addictive right now someone might have a serotonin imbalance so they're gonna keep wanting to go back to some serotonin magic thing does all you see all ssris are focused on that but it is all addiction relates to the dopamine axis hmm other things are involved but it will always involve [2322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2322.54s)

that okay now come back to our 3d 2d analogy with the cylinder but let's look at their models of time here and the circle and the the circular model of time linear model of time and if we embed those on each other in a higher dimension because those are both one-dimensional right one dimension curved back on itself like a circle or one dimension you know if time that just [2347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2347.8s)

continues straight if you bring them together you get a spiral of time right which is a circle that isn't closing on itself it's a circle that is actually moving along a line so then you say are there cycles yes there are cycles and there is net change from one cycle to the next now why this is meaningful as we see we look at the ecosystem and we see that you've got spring and fall and [2372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2372.07s)

spring and fall and things are born and die but over the course of deep time you look at the fossil record there's evolution of new organisms that weren't there before so there is net change over time while there are cycles and how that occurs it's important to understand that there are cycles because that means that in how you proceed in becoming you need to [2389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2389.71s)

have phases of activity and phases of rest phases of going outward and phases of coming inward phases of learning new things and then phases of applying that learning phase of learning new things phases of digesting and you know taking taking that to process with everything else you know if you don't understand it there are cycles every time it's time to come inward or to digest or to learn [2414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2414.58s)

something new or to step back you'll feel like you're not making progress but the key is that those like this or you'll never want to sleep right mm-hmm i've gone through phases where i'm pushing pushing pushing and then crash and it looked you know in hearing this i could have been more sensitive to the fact that it has to cycle in that way so you don't have to push and then crash [2443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2443.53s)

where the cycle forces itself on you you can go with it and you actually you optimize yourself over time hmm now at the same time you realize that within that cycle net growth is happening so you might come back to it's interesting how i can see this in some aspects of my life but then i completely neglect them and others right right well now the area's you've neglected [2466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2466.18s)

them and you can start looking at and saying where am i pushing where it is inexorable that there is a cycle that if i give space to it i'll actually get go further faster and i'll enjoy the process more my being and my becoming well both of all yeah so now we put this together right and if we have a model of time in which cycles happen but net growth also happens then and we start to [2488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2488.02s)

simple to reconcile all the elements of both of those do we want to be unconditionally able to access fullness and contentment now yes do we want to be able to access creative desire and passion about the future yes do we want to be excited about making something happen and not devastated if it doesn't happen yes both at the same time right do we want to be [2517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2517.21s)

optimizing our dopamine or jick circuits or our serotonergic circuits yes both right the fullness of the human experience and so we can see how different cultures were or pioneering the insights that now we can synthesize right they were pioneering how to really bring those insights and practices about where now as a global people that can harvest the wisdom from all these [2544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2544.12s)

cultures right here together we can really start to synthesize how do we be in the moment fully and be becoming fully and so the fullness of the human experience is both and if we look at it like this so here's someone and i want to love them unconditionally the way they are right now i also want to help them grow which one do i do to go back and forth between them when i really get [2566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2566.71s)

it i realize that they're the exact same thing the cylinder is actually one thing it isn't a bunch of circles stacked up is one thing right yeah if i love them the way they are completely the way they are is not actually a static thing they are a verb right they are different than they were yesterday they will be different tomorrow there's a sameness but there's a becoming that is part of [2590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2590.11s)

their being and because there is an impulse in them to express who they are more and more fully to self-actualize to self realize to add to universe to realize the depths of what's possible for them loving them for who they are is wanting for them is wanting for their fullest expression is also helping them become that so loving them unconditionally the way they are and [2612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2612.13s)

supporting them to be what they're becoming are the same fucking thing when you actually get that those aren't dichotomous at all the built within the being is verb ness this is this is extremely helpful and then i as you're talking about that some visualizing a couple different relationships i have where in the past i had a heart had a hard time accepting [2639](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2639.87s)

people where they were at mm-hm and then wanting more for them but the simple fact but i wasn't accepting them for where they were at in that moment and who they were becoming like potentially stunted that or it harmed the relationship in the least yeah in which case there was no way for me to be support think about this you were born in a particular place to a particular [2670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2670.26s)

family you really have much choice in that i'm not gonna get into if there was a spirit that did or no whatever you as you understand yourself to know much choice in them had you been born somewhere else right had you been even given up for adoption as an infant and had you had you grown up with the [2691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2691.109s)

matcha ganga tribe and in the amazon or had you grown up with the sioux indians or had you grown up on the upper east side manhattan with a banking family or almost every part of your identity would be different mm-hmm your aesthetics what you like what you don't like the language that you think in and perceive the world in your your everything right you know so so much of what you think is [2715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2715.2s)

you is other people it's other people that condition that in you and so when you are mess is true of everyone else - so when you're interacting with someone and there's something there dealing with some jealousy or laziness or pettiness or anger or whatever it is it's not them it is it's a part of the reality that they are dealing with and being right there's not essentially them that's what [2746](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2746.999s)

they were conditioned into now what you'll notice is the person's dealing with that jealousy but they're like i really want to show this jealousy and just love unconditionally why do they even want that if if who they really were was just jealous they'd just be stoked with it like yeah i'm just jealous fuck i'd like to be more jealous right like it is essentially something i [2767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2767.309s)

value but no they're like no i want to love more in canada i don't want to be angry i actually want to be a kinder person with it where does that want to come from even deeper than where it was conditioned as a moral or a value even when you strip those away there are deep impulses that connect to the deepest parts of the being of who they actually are and so what someone is wanting if [2789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2789.359s)

they don't know how to access it is deeper to the truth of who they are then what they're working through and stuck with so when you really love someone you're not you're not looking at all the conditioning bullshit that was put on them and in them you're looking at what is trying to express itself through that and saying wow i actually see underneath all of the drama and fear and [2809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2809.549s)

conditioning and nonsense actually see the being your and i love the shit out of it and that being is actually totally beautiful and totally unique and a nun conditioning loving that and accepting that it's dealing with this shit that it has to deal with i want to help it deal with it when i help it express who it really is more this reminds me of i i like i think i [2832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2832.2s)

create almost look like workarounds when i recognized something in a workaround i i came up with i'm not recognizing as a workaround potentially and then you can tell me what you think about it which is when i if i'm getting upset with somebody or somebody's getting upset with me i the way i've been framing it my mind is their story is upset with my story who [2865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2865.15s)

they are is not really upset with who i am they love you know if they were seeing me just for who i was or who i am and i'm seeing them for who they are then i would just love them it's the stories that are that are in the way would that be would that be accurate or do you think that's a workaround yeah so let me say it another way rosenburg the developer of the nomadic [2898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2898.41s)

communication system had a good way of saying this point said our fundamental needs and our fundamental values always work together sometimes our strategies for how we go about acting on those values or meeting those needs don't work together and sometimes we get very attached to the strategies and don't even make a distinction right so there's a couple and one of them is having [2921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2921.839s)

they're fighting about like you never go places and go to parties with me and you never give me fucking space and you know like that they're in that dialogue and they and one of them is really wanting the other person to go interact with their friends and the other one is really wanting to be about themselves and it seems like they are unreconciled things that they want and there's a [2945](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2945.15s)

million versions of this right but underneath it one person is usually wanting more that their actual need or values around connection when the truth is most people value connection and one of the and the other person might be valuing sovereignty you know or individuality freedom both people actually value freedom right and so when you get to [2972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2972.0s)

what is actually the essential value that i have here you'll realize we actually share this and they're like oh shit i want you to have freedom i want to freedom to oh i want you to have connection i want to have that too then you say if we were if we stopped being focused on i can only have connection if you do this thing with me this way which might be something you actually hate but [2990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=2990.45s)

there's plenty of other things you might like to do that we could connect on that's the strategy that's the strategy or i can only have freedom if i don't do this thing and i do this other thing and right maybe i can have the freedom to choose to do that rather than feel forced into it knowing that i'm choosing it right you know so if you let go of the strategies and you come to the needs [3009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3009.32s)

you say are there ever a time where those needs don't work together no they always work together or those values those values always work together so then to the degree we can actually chill out on the strategies and say is there a strategy that meets all the needs that fulfills all the value simultaneously there always will be yeah okay and this is another place of like getting past a [3032](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3032.72s)

false dichotomy it seems like these are unreconciled but when you can step to a higher level right the level of values not strategy they are reconcilable with this with this perspective i imagine people are thinking now what's there's nothing stopping us from loving each other fully why do we prefer some people over others and and who we connect with mm-hmm it's [3067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3067.0s)

a very deep question why do we or why should we continue to as we have all were very different oh we do historically for a bunch of mostly unconscious and not really great reasons right we prefer some people because they're the color that we're used to or because they're wealthy or because they're hot or because they're mostly like one that one is their right that's [3098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3098.98s)

that's a where your biology program to you i was gonna ask about that how much of that is biology and how much of that is culture well because there's definitely you know our our you look at what a model look like fifty years ago even now any difference and what different cultures find beautiful there are differences there's also similarities the similarities our [3125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3125.44s)

evolutionary biology and that relate to fertility right signs of fertility and the the differences are culture but the point is those are both conditioned now you relate with those but how many people are there that i could find really hot from an evolutionary biology point of view it would be absolutely terrible matches for me most of them ain't like it's not hard to go to a gym [3154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3154.44s)

or go to a beach and see a bunch of guys or girls that are hot regularly and yet they you might have almost exactly opposite core core worldviews values ideals beliefs you might be very symbiotic with supporting each other on a path or not and so it's not that that is a completely meaningless metric but it it's a metric that's important to make sure does not override your [3183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3183.43s)

assessment of all the other metrics and especially as you if you are thinking about enduring relationship if that metric will fade period it will fade because aging will change aesthetics and it will fade because even before aging changes aesthetics chemistry wears off as soon as it's no longer new and novel and if you think of it from an evolutionary biology point of [3211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3211.28s)

view there's a lot of evolutionary advantage to staying together long enough to make sure that offspring happens and then there's a lot of evolutionary advantage to have more offspring in more places so that some of them will get through right yeah and so that looks like serial monogamy right that looks like fall in love and then fall out of love fall in love somewhere [3236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3236.33s)

else if it's not falling in love it's falling in biochemical procreation patterns and then rationalizing a lot of love that is all really nonsense just so realizing that that is going to fade then you say all right how control by that do i want to be versus how much do i want to create something enduring what is an enduring basis of relationship and this is going to be now [3260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3260.3s)

this comes to being and becoming again our beings need to connect and our b comings need to connect if we're gonna have a relationship that's enduring who they are becoming and who i am becoming actually need to connect so that as time goes on we are on deeper and deeper paths so you see a lot of people it's like they're vectors are crossing so for a while they're coming closer together [3281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3281.39s)

and then they cross and then they start going further apart and to stay together they actually have someone has to pull the other one off their path mmm or they go further apart there are other people where it's almost like two converging vectors right like they're asymptotically converging towards each other and this is why part of a good fit is is not just does our lifestyle fit do [3302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3302.84s)

our way of being now fit to our chemistry's fit but it's actually do our deepest aspirations and our basis for choice and our visions of the future fit which is this is super meaningful right very and because this is something that people i imagine are exploring superficially mm-hmm and it might be superficially like do you want kids i want kids or you can make enough money [3333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3333.16s)

yeah okay cool we can do this but as it goes much deeper it's one of the metrics of a healthy relationship is that you're becoming paths right as you are evolving you're becoming paths that you are evolving better because of being in that relationship then you would being out of it right or being in a some other one that was less good of a fit in that way [3359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3359.01s)

and so who you you are actually being who you essentially are more fully because of their influence in your life this doesn't mean that you're codependent lea depending on them for it but it means they are an enhancement to the degree they're influencing you of your own being and your own becoming and you are for them oftentimes will have relationships that are more about [3380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3380.22s)

addiction than love where i'm actually being less of who i really want to be and then becoming less right i'm i'm less available to my friends and families i'm absorbed as fuck in the relationship i'm doing my work and my dorm and my creativity and my art and my etc and i practices less but i really really fucking like them right and and what you notice is my relationship to [3401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3401.72s)

them is a lot more like a relationship to cocaine or heroin than a relationship to an evolutionary path right it's more about i like the hip i'm getting from them and my life is getting worse because of it rather than i am actually evolving in who i essentially am one of the key criteria is with an addiction you become less able to enjoy anything else other than the addiction right this [3429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3429.48s)

if if you're addicted to coke when you're coming down off coke the sun sets not beautiful right flowers don't smoke only getting some more coke is the only thing right and if you don't get the coke fuck everything else and so you're focused on pleasure but it's becoming more and more and more focused on one source as one is moving in their actual enlightenment right there being [3453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3453.81s)

direction right the eastern side of this is their ability to love everything more to get to get connection pleasure with everything more and as they're evolving they're becoming they have ability to contributes everything more and that their being is evolving through they're becoming right they're actually evolving which is a becoming thing in their being and so if i have a relationship that's [3474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3474.119s)

like cocaine what it means is if they aren't calling me back there it takes me back i can't think about anything else i can't chill out i can i'm fucked up right life's meaningless and but when there when i get the hit everything's great that's addiction not love if it's actually a meaningful evolutionary relationship my ability to show up to [3497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3497.0s)

everything else in my life increases because of them my ability to love and appreciate everything else increased because i become a better friend because i'm learning how to communicate better from them i started loving and appreciating other people more because my heart so many more how long i didn't think we'd get into dating but i find myself people asking me for advice about [3527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3527.99s)

it and and you know i think i've given good advice in the past for sure this is actually really helpful for me and and even being able to to see what it is that i have in my own relationship and being able to direct others into finding something similar how long does it take to identify for somebody to go and this is a this is an addiction or and because we're really good at tricking ourselves [3555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3555.77s)

and you know this doesn't just apply to relationships but you know we may take a job or we may we make a lot of choices and well technically every everything in our life is a relationship you know we take a job where we're we're doing a thing in relationship with other people because everyone in the company is a relationship and business is just a series of relationships so at what point [3581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3581.119s)

are we how long does it take for someone a spot this is you know an addiction versus you know growth well you can actually notice the vector shift in the moment you can actually notice the quality of being in the moment so am i relating to this thing in a way where my presence to the rest of life is decreasing hmm or my presence of the rest of life is increasing i'm doing a [3615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3615.38s)

bodybuilding competition and all i can think about the bodybuilding competition and if i lose everything sucks in life and i actually don't really love the people in front of me actively and i mmm that might be an effective mindset to take to be obsessed about doing the bodybuilding thing but here's your question does doing create being will you actually be meaningfully happy with [3636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3636.98s)

who you are at the end if you win no because on the becoming side right okay so i became buff but then that's just gonna it's becoming forevers so then it's i'm not happy because it was only mr. world need to win mr. universe or whatever so then it'll lead to more becoming it'll never lead to being in that way unless the things i'm working on becoming are related to my being [3663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3663.17s)

right i'm actually evolving in my presence my character my and so one of the key things is am i even evolving the right things am i even focused on the evolution of the right things or do i have a wrong causation believed i have the belief that this strategy is how i will then be happy and so i'm trying to pursue happiness or how much money or how buff [3683](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3683.81s)

i get or something it is actually a wrong causal strategy no amount like yes i might get richer yes i might get buffer no i won't get happier that actually isn't related to a mechanic of happiness right and the happiness actually accessible now so then do i still have a reason to get buff or do i realize that was actually just nonsense maybe i do still have a reason to be [3704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3704.66s)

buff it might be a different one yeah so your question around how when do you notice so kind of all the time you can notice do i feel like my i am being more of who i really want to be your question and i might becoming more of who i want to be because of the way i'm showing up in this relationship in this job in this activity and if not if i'm being less of or becoming less of what i really most [3734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3734.63s)

value switch something yeah that's it's a sounds like a checking in process mhm i think that's that's something that we might want to look into doing more is how often are we checking and reflecting on what's going on well this is what mindfulness means is that can become continuous there can be a continuous noticing so there can be real-time [3759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3759.48s)

correction because especially as one gets more powerful there so they're moving faster then it when they get a little bit off if they don't check in as fast they can get much further off of what really matters right quickly so there's there's a good argument for the practicalness practice and is an argument for why it's some more important the more powerful you get yeah [3783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3783.599s)

absolutely it's the faster you're going the more steering matters what what are your favorite mindfulness practices or what is your what is your preferred method of improving mindfulness it's a huge topic right mindfulness basically means noticing what are you noticing so i can be mindful of my breath and so i'm noticing my breath and [3812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3812.6s)

the process noticing my body rising oh i wasn't i wasn't actually breathing very much or there's tightness or pain in my body i'm haven't been paying attention to or there's a lot of anxiety i wasn't paying attention to what do i want to do about that right that may help you feel a lot better in your body might help you change things you need to change and i [3832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3832.46s)

hope you live longer right because you notice something you tend to it so there's you know there's body based mindfulness there's noticing your thoughts and noticing how many of your thoughts are fundamentally in a positive empowering direction and how many of them are basically have no meaningful utility right like they are negative but not [3858](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3858.25s)

negative in a constructive way and then as soon as you notice that when you don't notice that you really have no choice cuz it's just an automated program running itself out you didn't choose the moment you notice it choice enters the possibility for choice enters you can say well do those thoughts affect how i feel yes do they affect how i perceive you [3875](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3875.019s)

have to they affect how i act yeah so how do i want to shift the thoughts so that i perceive enact it feel differently you can notice your emotion similarly and say oh when i notice i'm feeling angry or agitated etcetera then i want to actually stop and see what i can do to shift my state and recenter because if i'm acting from that state that's [3895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3895.569s)

gonna be subtly affecting how i perceive and how i behave there's a lot of things you can notice you can notice that we're talking about here being in relationship and your own sense of being on path and being in relationship and how those relate to each other so there's a lot of good mindfulness practices for various aspects of it and they cross apply right [3920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3920.88s)

just increasing awareness is valuable but i would say a very deep one is if someone takes some time to write around being like you were saying i want to be a person that invokes people's trust in is worthy of it want to be a person who has character that leads to me being a support and a pillar for the community not because i asked to be but because people just recognize that i show up in [3950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3950.579s)

a way that supports me buddy so you kind of look who do i really want to be and then what how do i most want to become what i most want to do what are the things i really want to contribute to it and you mind this and then you ask why on all these things and you say how much of that is still because of some unconscious shit that my parents taught me how much of it is still because i'm [3970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3970.71s)

insecure and don't think i'm enough and this is my compensation strategy and then you see can i let that go and then what do i actually want underneath that and you get deeper and deeper of what do i really value and then you're mindful of is what i'm doing right now is what i'm thinking right now is the state i'm in right now aligned with what i most deeply value [3995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=3995.46s)

and if so great and if not shift simplicity i think that's a it's probably one of the not probably i think that's the best explanation around mindfulness and the argument for why you might pick up a meditation practice which is a practice of noticing with is not yeah there's not intentional plug even but the supplement quality which [4033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4033.39s)

you created i've been taking it for a year i've noticed that it has helped create an expanded awareness for myself and then i would say my wife even explain what she's report has been much more dramatic even so that there there's it's taking a supplement like that adding if you're not having that mindfulness practice and just taking it unconsciously you're gonna fire the [4071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4071.18s)

rocket in the wrong direction good yeah we've had many people describe being unqualified that the effect it had on neuro chemistry getting more balanced for them actually help them get clear where they weren't before because it helped shift their state and so as they were shifting out of agitation or anger or depression or whatever into more centered empowered [4103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4103.71s)

states none of these are medical claims make no medical claims but this is what people reported some of their experience that it led to them being able to hold clarity morin you know etc many people because there's there's things for the body's endocrine system to balance it out so you're less likely to get swayed by triggers so or maybe we shouldn't get can you make these types of comments i [4130](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4130.92s)

guess let me finish we're was not sort of acting on the mechanism because it's all relevant so other people have described that when they feel on right they feel generally centered they take qualia they feel a lot better they feel like they have more power nitrous right into the system when they are off they're angry they're agitated wherever they take qualia then they feel more [4158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4158.07s)

empowered but they're not directing it and in a way right like the not directing their thoughts very sovereignly and so now they actually feel kind of more of that going on so for most people it has been supportive for them coming to center if they are not but for some people the order of operations assets that more centering would be more software side would be no [4180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4180.63s)

relevant first or at least in conjunction with well you think about it and relate it back to like or what would a supplement have to do with anything we're talking about if you think of the brain and the associated rest of the physiology as the hardware right the bio hardware mm-hmm that the kind of software of thought and emotion is running on except that the division [4207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4207.99s)

between hardware and software and computers is a hard one right the software is not affecting the hardware the hardware has to be adequate to the software to run on it in us every time you change the physiology it automatically changes the predispositions for thinking and feeling and every time you have a thought or a feeling it is actually an [4230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4230.4s)

electrochemical process that is then changing physiology so there it's all kind of firmware that's interacting each other yeah it's not fair to think about it as a typical computer it's not that distinct but it is a fine starting place to say that most of what we call psychology is on the software side of the gradient it's a gradient rather than a hard binary right and so it's a the [4252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4252.24s)

psychology is looking at what do you focus on what meaning do you make from things you know etc so mindfulness also would fit in there that most medicine and biohacking neuro hacking biophysical optimization is focused on the hardware side of things but these automatically and or affect each other because everyone has experienced having their body out of balance having a headache or [4278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4278.31s)

their hormones are out or a hangover or whatever where your physiology affects your psyche no doubt and you're angry or you're depressed or whatever because of a physiologic process people have also noticed when their physiology feels great say they recover from a sickness now they feel good in their body again how that automatically affects their psyche [4298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4298.63s)

right we also have noticed where you get really stressed out psychologically and you get sick right or you feel great psychologically and you feel increased energy so you can see that there's this psycho neuro in so the optimal process is to pull the levers one can in both simultaneously leading to virtuous feedback loops and up cycling so how do i work with my focus to focus on [4327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4327.79s)

empowering things how do i work with my meaning to create empowering meaning to that which i'm focusing on how do i work with my just energetic state through visualization through breath through subtle kinds of movements etc how do i work with my body through chemistry health diet fitness supplementation where each of these lead to a system that is up regulating in or affecting [4353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4353.17s)

all the other aspects so qualia is something that the first product that we designed in our collective to help up regulate certain aspects of neuro chemistry and neural physiology so that the hardware that is mediating thought and emotion is both more in tune right more balanced and moving towards more net capacity through things like neurogenesis development of more neurons [4377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4377.8s)

or more synapses more actual computational capability and the reason why we developed that and all the other projects that were in process of developing on the hardware side is the goal of neuro hacker collective is actually evolving sovereignty may helping evolve the collective sovereignty of humanity and we define sovereignty as as the relationship [4398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4398.05s)

between three different vectors and you know so we imagine three vectors xyz axis perpendicular to each other one is intelligence one is agency one is sentient so intelligence is our ability to understand things our ability to understand they caught them as things together and how to optimize for both them and right our ability to think critically to think systemically to have [4424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4424.93s)

a total body of knowledge that's meaningful memory intelligence right agency is our ability to in disposition to make choices or follow through our responsibilities or drive or resilience or all you know all the things that move us in universe and our sentience is actually our depth of feeling and our feelings of our self our feeling of whether we really are in tune or not our [4454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4454.63s)

depth of being right presents connection with life at the moment and others are empathy and our ability to feel other people so you actually see how agency very much relates to becoming and being and sentient sar very related and the intelligence can help reconcile the relationships between those so if you think about evolving sentient evolving sentient fully starts to look like [4485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4485.83s)

bodhisattva it looks like the embodiment of deep compassion embodied awareness etc evolving intelligence looks like polymath right like full genius across multiple spectrum evolving agency looks like power the ability to have more power to actually create in reality fully empowered bodhisattva polymaths we believe our will be the new normal in the future and have to be the new normal [4514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4514.9s)

in the future because the scope of issues that the world is facing actually require people who are fully caring for the whole have profound capabilities complex thinking problem-solving capabilities and a profound amount of agency to do to actually take care of a lot of shit right and so we define all of those together the volume of the sphere defined by the shortest of those [4538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4538.48s)

vectors as kind of proportional semi proportional roughly to one sovereignty and so what we're talking about here is you can also think of then that being and becoming are both parts of defining the sphere of what matters right and the relationship between them being becoming in the and the relationship between how we navigate those yep [4563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4563.34s)

i'm gonna have to go back and listen to this show it's been i'm not sure i have anything left to ask i definitely want to have you back on for another round is there anything that you want to mention or something i didn't ask that i should have asked i run into this a lot of times when i'm talking to somebody who knows a lot more about what they're talking about than i do [4590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4590.4s)

and there's always you know what question that i not asked that maybe i should have it's a very meaningful application of this dichotomy and looking at the situation in the moment which is is everything really fucked up or is everything actually perfect right and everything tending to itself mmm and it's both in neither but it's [4628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4628.639s)

actually again the cylinder isn't just both in either circle rectangle there's a deeper way of understanding what that means we can look at how all the exponential technology you know your phone has the computational capability of supercomputers not that long ago we can look at all the all of the places where technology is giving us the capability of building better technology [4656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4656.749s)

faster that is enriching certain aspects of the quality of people's lives and when they're tremendous metrics on how everything's getting better the same time there's all these metrics regarding biodiversity loss and ocean acidification and overarching environmental metrics problems and war that's empowered by more and more powerful technology and where [4682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4682.659s)

everything's getting worse and you can cherry-pick the data on either side you want look at big enough data sets things are getting exponentially worse and exponentially better at the same time you'd say well what does that mean if things are getting exponentially better next one and she worse but obviously neither of those in our the trajectory to project what we're going [4704](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4704.239s)

what it means is the current system is destabilizing right things are moving further and further away from a center line the system's destabilizing because we have a [[world system]] overarching lis it is coming to the end of its lifecycle at the end of its phase where we've you know we've had a [[world system]] that had exponentially increasing population with exponentially increasing resource per [4726](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4726.499s)

capita all based on extracting more and more stuff i couldn't see more stuff from the earth each year and turning it into trash how long can you run a linear [[materials economy]] where you take stuff out of the earth unruhe new ibly faster than it regenerates and then turn it into trash put it back in the earth on a finite planet you know with an exponential rate of you can trim it that [4745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4745.789s)

long and we're basically at the end you know so and yet that system has given the technologies and tools that are necessary to build the next system right and so we're at this very interesting place what is necessary for the emergence of a new world it is at a radically higher quality of life possible for everyone than has been possible so far is [4770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4770.57s)

emerging but it will be a fundamental redesign of everything of economics of governance of infrastructure of world view we're also to place with a current world it really is ending and having to change and so then we it feels antiquated i'm not sure if it's a generational thing on if every generation feels this well no this is not just generational there's [4793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4793.01s)

generational stuff but there's there's since the plow we started you know removing stuff from earth faster than we were regenerating it and since the [[industrial revolution]] you know exponentially faster and we're actually talking about the end of a phase that started then so it's not that long well not that long in evolutionary terms but the entirety of what we call [4816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4816.17s)

recorded history yeah yeah considering so from evolutionary not long from you know from human awareness of our own history standpoint the whole of what we've had so far as a phase coming to an end which has been a phase defined by finite games zero-sum games finite amount of resources and the total number of us are growing and were competing for those finite resources and if you have [4844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4844.28s)

them i don't if i have them you don't and so our answer is pull the resource set a nature faster and compete with each other harder and now our tools of competition our tools of warfare are big enough to destroy the entire planet and we our ability to pull the resources out is enough that it can also destroy the whole planet so we've outgrown the playing field and so that game is coming [4864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4864.02s)

to an end so either we end with that game or we create a new game in the new game will be an infinite game not a finite game it'll be a positive something zero-sum and it'll be one where fundamentally our ability to thrive another business ability to thrive or not in opposition to each other yeah and that is an economic model shift right it is a [4886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4886.49s)

worldview shift it is and we could do another show just focused on these topics that's exactly what i was going to suggest i've been we're going from the micro to the macro here's where we'll tie them together yeah we live in a time when there is more at stake than there has ever been where [4913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4913.49s)

because of the magnitude of our technology we can all affect more than anyone has ever been able to affect gandhi couldn't put things on youtube and get virality right and so we we have the potential to affect things in a way that it could actually contribute to moving in the direction of humans mount continuing or a higher quality of life than anyone has ever been able to realize emerging so this is this is the context for all of us contemplating our becoming so the being side is i can access the same state of timeless fullness and beauty now that people could in the time of buddha right because it's eternal it's timeless and that can be a place i can access as respite and as fuel to then come in to this actual time which is very different [4969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4969.89s)

than the time of buddha or any other time and say my becoming is not to win at a game that is dying but is to actually try and help change the game what is my role what is the role that i could have in self actualizing in a way that serves not just me but all life so i'll just leave it as a thought to tie the micro and the macro i like that that's a it's a [4996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=4996.56s)

purpose worth pursuing i like that you know excellent thank you for joining us tonight i think everyone it's gonna get a lot out of it like i said out i'm gonna go back listen again and make sure i harvest this fully and i encourage everyone that's listen to this to do the very same so thank you for joining us daniel thanks for having me always fun [5022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqq840poanw&t=5022.48s)
