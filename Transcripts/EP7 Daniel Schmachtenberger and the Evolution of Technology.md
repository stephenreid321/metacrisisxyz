howdy this is jim rut and this is the jim rut show music this is the gym rut show and i'm your host jim rut today's guest is daniel sh mutton burger daniels an independent thinker focusing on the future of civilization the sensitivity and potential of our current situation and how we may navigate the path forward he's also director of r&d [30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=30.2s)

and co-founder of the neuro hacker collective welcome daniel thanks for having me jim and looking forward to this conversation yeah i followed your work for some time and while i keep my eye on several thinkers who are thinking about the future of our society your perspective is perhaps both the most dire and the most hopeful interesting that you can be both yeah i call that [51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=51.02s)

kind of a hard fork hypothesis i like that it's a good way to describe it you know on the dire side you know you say pretty explicitly you believe humanity is going to end relatively soon we don't address some of our fundamental design issues in our social operating system yeah i basically say that when we look at history we see that most of the previous civilizations obviously they [73](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=73.52s)

don't still exist and they underwent internal decay that led to how their collapse occurred and we can look at the way that tainter studies this oh the way jared diamond did or the way that kind of straus how or baudrillard or different models of civilization will collapse describe it but they're just like people have a life cycle there seem to be these life cycles of civilization [94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=94.729s)

and there are certain things in common that lead to their breakdown the difference now is that we have a fully globalized civilization and rather than just causing local environmental harm that can lead to a limits of growth issue we can affect the habitability the biosphere at large obviously we didn't use to have weapons of mass destruction so there's a total [113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=113.75s)

difference of the capacity for warfare etc rates of technology both the globalization and technology have changed the magnitude of the issues in a way where the change of magnitude actually becomes a change in kind and yet we haven't figured out not [[civilizational collapse]] so if we forecast all of the different possible [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] or [[existential risk|existential risks]] there's a lot of them and what i would say is that they all are the result of some under common [[generator function|generator functions]] and so as a result if we just tried to deal with a particular agi scenario or a particular [[climate change]] or a particular biodiversity loss or world war three scenario we don't buy ourselves that much time before another scenario [153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=153.63s)

emerges because the situation is basically over determined so we actually have to address the [[generator function|generator functions]] we have to address it categorically rather than just instances and if we do that that becomes the kernel of a new civilizational model that is radically different than any civilizations heretofore which is the more optimistic picture and this is kind of like a hard [172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=172.319s)

fork between very different scenarios yeah that was i was gonna say on the hopeful side you're basically trying at least to define a new social operating system and at least for me and my kind of naive way of looking at things it's still a very rough sketch but i can see that if you are able to fill this in it may make human life vastly better and more humane than it's ever been before [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=193.35s)

before we get to your specific so i would like for our audience and keep in mind that our audience are smart people i hope but they're not necessarily experts on the way you and i and jordan and some of our friends talk so i want to make sure that neither of us get too far afield in jargon and that we make sure that we bring substrate issues up before we dive in deeper specifically [214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=214.709s)

i've heard you talk in the past very eloquently about how human created technology is a fundamental change in the dynamics of the world and that technology i invented technology is fundamentally different than evolution and produces fundamentally different dynamics we'll talk about that a little bit before we jump into the more specifics of where we're at yeah it's [237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=237.09s)

definitely a kind of central thing for us to figure out especially when if we don't realize this we try and use evolutionary biology and evolutionary theory to model human systems like reifying theory of markets based in evolutionary theory and social darwinism writ large and that actually my assessment doesn't work a lot of this insight on the fundamental difference of [258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=258.209s)

and evolution and highlighting it with something forrest landry helped me understand but model goes like this in evolution in evolved systems we can kind of think of evolution is defined by three primary characteristics which is mutation occurs and then selection occurs but selection is two things does the agent survive and does it reproduce so survival selection mate selection and [281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=281.03s)

then obviously that is survival and mating with in evolutionary niches now something to understand about that is that the mutation pressures that are affecting everything in an ecosystem there's a kind of evenness of the distribution of mutation pressures whether we're talking about gamma rays or oxidation or just copying errors or viruses they're affecting all of the [301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=301.04s)

lions pretty similarly and the lions and the gazelles and the plants so we don't have radical mutation occurring in one place and no mutation occurring somewhere else and so as you have a mutation that would make a lion faster or any predator faster you have similar mutations that have a distribution and the fastness and slowness of the prey animals so then of course if you get a [320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=320.15s)

little bit faster in one and they say the lion eats the slower gazelles then the fastest gazelles reproduce and that leads to doubling down on those genes so that's the next part is not just a evenness in the distribution of mutation but also co selective pressures and so the advance is anywhere lead to a pretty strong symmetric coupling of power across the whole system and so this [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=341.09s)

leads to a situation where you do have rival risk dynamics in nature you do have something like individual agents doing self maximization of course it's not purely that we have a lot of symbiosis we have animals that are paying attention to their yog and animals that wouldn't survive it's not for the whole group of animals that you can model individual self optimizing [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=360.17s)

agents and get a certain successfulness if you have the cemetry of power so you have this line in this gazelle are in rival risk dynamic but all lions and all gazelles are symbiotic with each other meaning the lions would die without the gazelles the gazelles would die without the lions and as either one makes an advancement it drives the other one to make an advancement so this is kind of [381](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=381.74s)

where when we think of social darwinism we think of the idea that competition drives innovation and advancement and those types of things the difference when tech comes about is so again these changes in the animals are happening mediated through genetics mutation of the genes and then survival and then recombinant parts of the genes so the genes are physically instantiated [399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=399.79s)

pattern replicators when technology technology i don't just mean [[physical tech]] i also mean language i also mean [[social tech]] coordination tech but so techne and the sanskrit sense of consciously mediated methods of doing things basically things that come from the capacity for abstraction and creating abstract pattern replicators the abstract pattern replicators can [420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=420.88s)

change much faster than the instantiated ones can and they can change and with an uneven distribution so when we think about [[tool making]] starting with you know homo habilis and stone tools right which is very different than a chimp using a rock that it finds but not whittling sharper you know we're chipping a sharper rock which is the chimp or the bird or whatever it is that's using [443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=443.77s)

something can experientially notice that this thing is better at doing what it wants than this thing is in the moment but it can't understand that between all three rocks why this one is better at cutting the thing is because of the abstract principle of sharpness and then say oh i understand what mediates sharpness and i can design something with more sharpness that abstraction [462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=462.46s)

capacity seems to be part of how we define early humans and then got double down in homo sapiens and it's a different process than evolution of bringing new stuff into existence it's not occurring through kind of random mutation and just selective dynamics it's occurring through an agent that's actually understanding something abstractly and intentionally creating it [482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=482.11s)

and so if you think about evolution as the stuff that emerges there wasn't a conscious choice to have something emerge it emerged as the result of complexity dynamics so it's unconscious it's radically parallel it's radically distributed it's radically combinatoric it's slow almost everything fails but you get a interoperability of everything so what makes it through or very [503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=503.05s)

self-stabilizing [[complex system|complex systems]] with technology it's actually consciously created it can happen in a local way not everywhere so it's not radically parallel and decentralized it happens more in a serial fashion and it creates parts that are not necessarily in equilibrium with whole systems and so it really is mathematically almost an [523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=523.7s)

opposite kind of creative process and the thing is if you have an evolutionary agent like a human that has evolutionary motives but is now able to say human operating as [[apex predator]] can increase its predatory capacity orders of magnitude rapidly faster than the environment can increase its resilience to that predatory capacity now we have a fundamental problem this is a lion [548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=548.06s)

getting a thousand times faster in a hurry without gazelles being able to make a mutation in adequate time and lions eat all the gazelles and then go extinct and so we have a situation where technology has broken the power cemetry that is what is necessary for the meta stability of evolved systems and so you see that not only is there cemetry of power between the line and the gazelle [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=570.8s)

there's also a symmetry of power between lions and lions and gazelles and gazelles the most badass lion is only you know 2x or one and a half x more than the median lion but if we look at putin's killing ability or trump's compared to yours or mine it might be billions or trillions of times more and the same we could say for economic capacity and if you look at [591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=591.62s)

sapiens writ large compared to the rest of the biosphere it's similar and so when you think about like you know one lion just even if it went rogue and didn't just kill to survive to start killing everything it could it has such limited destructive capacity and that's not true and especially as we get into decentralized [[exponential tech]] one actor or a small group of actress has really [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=611.51s)

radical amplification of agency so if you keep having rivalries agency rivalries basis for agency but with very high power relative to the overall playing field you end up getting a basis for fundamental instability and of course it's not always all about destruction either you know two data points that jump out at me that we are doing things that we think of as constructive that have to be getting well near our limits are you know for instance the fact that of the large mammals on earth it's now thought that the majority of the biomass is humans plus our domesticated animals and when it comes to birds it's even more radical it's thought that the domesticated birds represent 70% of the biomass of all [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=656.329s)

birds on earth and so nothing destructive specifically destructive about catching and killing but we've essentially engineered a technology which is co-opted a majority or 70% of the energetics and biomass of the biome and it's continuing to grow exponentially which strikes me as a very strong signal which is very little talked about yeah so this is you know [680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=680.66s)

kind of a limits of growth thing as opposed to say a warfare or terrorism or you know intentioned destructive thing so think about this we think of [[apex predator|apex predators]] they evolved to fit a niche and because they're adaptive capacity is mediated through genes through concrete pattern replicators they don't do very well outside of that knee and so polar bears don't leave the arctic right and [703](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=703.339s)

cheetahs don't leave the savanna and orcas don't get out of the ocean but because our [[apex predator]] capacity was mediated by tools and we could make different tools including different coverings for ourselves and in different environments when we would overkill an environment rather than have our population stabilized we would just move to a new environment to become the [[apex predator]] there and so we went and became [[apex predator]] everywhere over hunted and over farmed environments everywhere over fished etc that is really different than every other animal and like again if we think of the examples you were just giving this like total biodiversity loss and the relationship of total animal life in domestication versus wild if you think about an [[apex predator]] like in orca or a great white shark in the ocean and how many fish it can kill in an hour and then you think about a ocean trawler with a mile long drift net it's just not even like obviously we aren't [[apex predator|apex predators]] they can't destroy whole ecosystems they also can genetically engineer new creatures so we have to stop modeling ourselves as [[apex predator|apex predators]] competing with each other to be better [[apex predator|apex predators]] and take the top because the destructive capacity even of not intending to destruct just of intending to extract is well beyond the replenish rates of the system yeah and on top of that and on our first episode with simon today oh we talked fair amount about the rate of social evolution is accelerating the rate of invention of new [789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=789.32s)

technologies new capabilities is way faster now than it was just 30 years ago and if we're already approaching the limits probably exceeded the sustainable limits of our society and we have social evolution that's going exponential and we still have a rising world population last i saw projected to top out 11 billion with many of those people expecting a increase in their lifestyle [811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=811.72s)

quote unquote towards the american and european one looks like to me a trainwreck coming at very high speed right and so again this idea that we didn't start over hunting an environment and then it became harder to eat and breed so then we came in to sustainable population with the environment we just moved to another environment there is this kind of rebound effect that we see [835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=835.279s)

with humans and we see it in all of evolution right like our friend bred why interesting we'll say if there's an evolutionary niche it will get filled with something right so in the similar sense though with humans we don't have to wait for a genetic mutation we can have a memetic mutation to figure out how to exploit some new niche and so this is where we get rebound effects [854](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=854.99s)

where it increases in efficiency don't lead to us being more sustainable the environment they lead to us figuring out how to have profitable exploits on more area and so you know when you look at something like the jebin's paradox or other abstractions of it if i give a 20% increase in energy efficiency we don't just use 20% less energy we find whole new markets that weren't open based on [874](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=874.97s)

now the what's gonna be profitable we go exploit those and in the abusing more net energy as a result and so when you look at like trying to figure out a steady-state population steady-state population doesn't actually work it doesn't work the way that we like to model in evolutionary biology with the way that humans continue to advance increases in capacity and efficiency and [895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=895.34s)

then exploit all yeah and you've spoken quite a bit about you combine exponentially increasing technology with the core rival risks win-loss dynamics of at least our [[economic system]] and a goodly part of our [[social system]] you talk a little bit about how the coupling of those two together are spectacularly different than either by itself yeah so this is i mentioned earlier that all the [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=919.28s)

catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] have underlying [[generator function|generator functions]] what i mean by that is that so like let's say we're looking at wanting to stop or take your kind of environmental destruction or war or whatever it is well we can look at why are those things caused and we can find some things that seems special to specific instances but some things that are part of a causal set [942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=942.83s)

that are true across all of them so obviously we can look at something like [[perverse incentive]] and so with the environmental destruction if the wild birds aren't worth very much to us in the wild but domesticated ones and farms where the farms take over the wild areas are if cattle are worth something to us when domesticated and then killed and not when they're free and of course we [964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=964.19s)

have an economic incentive to exploit everything and the same would be true if we have a for-profit military industrial complex where war is more profitable than pieces and so the underlying idea here is that you can't prevent a harm well there is a very strong incentive to cause it because that incentive is kind of an evolutionary niche for a particular and way of getting ahead and [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=984.05s)

it will end up getting filled so we try to make law to bind that but as we know strong economic power ends up being able to influence law pretty heavily so the thing that is designed to bind the problems of the incentive system ends up getting corrupted by the incentive system so we can get into that more later but this is an idea of something like [[perverse incentive]] that isn't unique to one issue it's underneath lots of issues so if we want to abstract and say what are the generators that give rise to all of the possible [[existential risk|existential risks]] in the future the first one is the one that you just mentioned first one i would identify is that if humans are running rival risk games and by right wrist games i mean some in group that is seeking to get ahead in a way that can [1022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1022.77s)

occur at the expense of an out group and/or the comments so whether that's a person or a company or a country if it can beat someone else via a war or it can exploit an environment and get ahead or it can corner the market or whatever it is it's playing a game where it's win is going to require or at least reserves the right to be at the cost of something else if we run rival risk games but we're not limited in our rival risk capacity the way animals are because we can innovate new ways of winning and rivalry via abstraction ie tech but then the moment we deploy some new asymmetric tech everybody sees it reverse engineers it makes mutations on it and so we keep ratcheting up power then we get an exponential power equation but we're [1068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1068.04s)

we're using power in ways that inexorably cause some harm to the total system when you you can't actually run exponential harm in a finite playing field and not have more entropy than the system can handle so rivalries games multiplied by [[exponential tech]] self-terminate and right now [[exponential tech]] is inexorable we cannot put the cat back in the bag we can't stop it so [1088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1088.83s)

either we figure out rigorously anti rivalry systems or the human experiment as we know it is finite in duration but the thing is to say rivalry systems that's a big deal because separate [[nation state|nation states]] are the basis of rivalry systems and so our private balance sheets and so the changes that we're proposing are very very fundamental ones they're ones at the level of the axioms [1110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1110.49s)

of what we think of as civilization but that's why we have to start by saying all previous civilizations also failed we actually have to change things at a deeper level right we're not talking about just making a new civilization where this is similar to the enlightenment for the renaissance or the founding of america or the beginning of sumeria it's it's actually different in [1129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1129.0s)

kinds in each of those changes because each of those changes have been an ratcheting of rival risk capacity some new coordination capacity or technological capacity that led to more capacity to win rivalries games against an out-group i'm basically saying now humanity as a whole with no out group has to figure out how to do trailers games as you know i'm [1149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1149.99s)

interested in this and have worked on some of it and thought about a little bit but i'm gonna play the cheerful skeptic here for a moment if you don't mind and offer a possible argument that says maybe we don't have to go that far and again i'm not gonna say this is my actual belief but let's say this is a well-established argument for a less radical approach which we might call [1170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1170.87s)

democratic liberalism and you know in passing talked about the fact that our legal system our political system has been hijacked by our economic and financial systems we could in theory fix that it may require an amendment to the constitution and some other things but it could be fixed secondly the depletion of the commons the democratic liberal argument is if we priced the [1193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1193.46s)

externalities correctly we could defend the commons we also look at ostrom theories of managing the commons and those are assumed to take place in a world with rivalries economics around them well how would you respond to those who say rather than changing the jet engine on the airplane while it's in flight we'd be better off attempting to be smart about fixing our democratic [1216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1216.559s)

liberalism by breaking the hack between money and politics and by rigorously and probably initially very conservatively meaning expensively pricing externalities i will say that that is formally impossible and explain why but there's a few aspects to it so well like this we'll take a minute take us what stop me feel like this is really important i would start by wanting to [1242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1242.12s)

just be clear on the fundamental difference between a market and a government and the relationship between those because what you're talking about is a government regulating a market yes in fact that would call that the modern democratic liberal synthesis that started in the 1920s was fully in existence by the 1930s and was locked in in its modern form in 1948 great so what [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1264.11s)

i would say is that there are certain architectures within markets that lead inexorably to certain issues other within governments and i'm gonna try and abstract us at the most abstract level that works which is this will be true for any form of government whether it's a two-party system or a three-party system or has a parliament or doesn't do too simply the nature of it being a [1285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1285.85s)

top-down imposition of law via monopoly of force and the same is true for whether we're talking about any different version of how one might think of a market so if we think of a market you can actually think about theory of markets like pure lays a fair theory and try and model it via evolutionary theory and people do and this is where social darwinism kind of comes right which is [1307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1307.03s)

these three things mutation survival selection and then mating mating selection are what define the success of markets so you have an environmental niche which here would be called demand people need real stuff and so then that creates a impetus to try and figure out how to fit that niche which is supply it will make some product or service to try and do it but they'll make slightly [1328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1328.09s)

different versions that equals mutation the one that actually meets people's needs best of the best value is the one that will make it through survival selection and then if a few of them have different properties that are all really desirable they might mate and meaning you know merger and acquisition or ip trade or whatever and you get a recombinant oriole dynamic and that's [1345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1345.7s)

main selection and that's the idea right except as we mentioned that's true but you don't get the meta stability of an evolved system because of the a symmetries are gonna be intrinsic to abstract replicators that aren't therefore instantiated replicators so if we think about a market as a bottom-up coordination system and bottom-up meaning that we aren't we don't have [1367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1367.929s)

long term central planning of what we're trying to do everybody's not trying to agree on something we're just interacting with each other via supply and demand dynamics and stuff gets up regulated so that basically the society is all [[emergent property|emergent properties]] of the bottom-up interactions so that's one kind of thing and we can really think of as having certain characteristics of [1387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1387.55s)

just the bottom-up math of it one thing i would say then and this is a critique of libertarian ideology free-market kind of ideology writ large is that without regulation markets are going to have [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] that they cannot resolve and by a [[multipolar trap]] it's a generalization of weather it's a tragedy of the commons or an [[arms race]] or any kind of race to the cliff a [[race to the bottom]] these are scenarios where somebody can do something that is bad for the whole over the long term but very good for them over the near term and provides so much competitive advantage that without law to bind it people will still buy the thing they will still be able to get employees right like the market forces won't stop it and so then everyone else has to [1430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1430.929s)

compete to do the same thing or they will just lose by default in the short term so now you have everybody competing to get the cheaper material that is comprehensively damaging the environment or racing to cut down the trees faster than they actually need them because if they don't the other guy will cut down the trees anyways or one guy makes a i weapon so everybody has to make the ai [1452](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1452.11s)

weapons where they're going to lose by default and so [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] in the past when we had limited power could lead to boom and bust cycles where we start polluting the water because say everybody else isn't polluting the water my pollution of the water doesn't make it that much worse but not having to deal with my pollution properly increases my margins [1473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1473.71s)

because i externalize some of the cost so i'm getting ahead then other people say it that guy's getting so much more ahead everybody starts doing it eventually the water is so polluted that everybody is doing worse because the fish are all dead so then there's now a new market for selling water purifiers and so we start doing that thing until you know then there is a new scenario [1491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1491.38s)

for the pollution to occur so you get these kind of best you get a [[race to the bottom]] and then some new market opportunity race to the top with exponentially more people and exponentially more power per person more moreover you have situations where the bottom can be so bad that it's unrecoverable let me jump but here you're drawing the classic 19th [1510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1510.26s)

century adam smith quasi-libertarian model suppose though we take a more modern social democratic perspective where we assume it is the job of the legal political government side as instantiated through democracy to put limits on the market and when i call what i've called in the past parametric social democracy where instead of a bunch of fine grained regulations used a [1532](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1532.82s)

dozen or so very powerful settings on the gravitational attractors within the game itself i'll just throw out two examples which i've talked about the past in some detail one would be a high and rapidly rising carbon tax let's say $50 a ton to start rising $10 a year for 15 years to $200 a ton which would send a magnificently powerful signal to stop using carbon would empower alternative [1560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1560.66s)

energy production in a very major way a second one much simpler one of the hacks we know that our current system does is you psychologically informed advertising to invent demand suppose we put a two hundred percent tax on all advertising i have ten more i could throw out there so why can't a list of powerful parameters tame the market without having to undergo the radical shift that you're [1584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1584.09s)

talking about forgive me i was starting with an unregulated market because i wanted to establish something about theory of the markets which is why we can do just a libertarian thing and why there is a good case for a regulated market now once you then do a construction on what's wrong with governments and then i want to do a construction on what's wrong with them [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1605.03s)

together because i have to refer to what's wrong with each one individually before i can do the combined test all right you go right ahead okay so basically anything that has bottom-up coordination only but abstraction mediated capacities like markets is going to fall to [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] with [[exponential tech]] will be catastrophic ly bad that's that [1622](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1622.88s)

then this is at least of the story of a major reason why we justify creating states which is okay we don't want everybody to cut down all of the trees just to store them as lumber because if they don't do i will and were left with no trees and yet how do we deal with this we have a real coordination problem well we need to create some entity that has the [1644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1644.35s)

ability to stop everybody from doing it and so that entity needs some kind of monopoly of force to be able to actually uphold an agreement so we want something like rule of law we want the ability to come up with good laws and we want the ability to enforce those laws so we agree to bequeath to a government a legitimate monopoly on violence which internal is a police force without which [1667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1667.39s)

law doesn't actually exist right the thing that we think of as law doesn't exist and then externally a military force so that the freedom for us to do this thing is upheld against other groups now we can say why do we create states well one reason is to unify groups to be able to win wars and defend themselves and the other is to solve [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] ie create rule of law so that we can coordinate better and arguably the actual reason is to consolidate power even more but that is not the answer that is given it when justifying it so if we think about a government the government is now not a bottom-up system it's a top-down system meaning that there is some centralized rather than decentralized body that can actually make choices whether it's a [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1711.61s)

monarchy or a oligarchy or democracy or whatever so it's one person or it's a majority of people there is some process to be able to say okay this is the law we're going to do and here's then how that law will be upheld via the agency of that central body in its monopoly force now we can identify things that will end up going wrong with top-down systems and we're trying to bind the [1734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1734.649s)

problems associated with incentive and yet the agents who are mediating cuz the government isn't actually an entity in and of itself even though it's acting like it it's run by people who are all still agents within the [[economic system]] that all still have incentives themselves to the judge and the lobbyists and the lawyer and the politician all still have their own [1755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1755.529s)

fundamentally still largely rival risk basis for wanting increased status power it is yeah the famous economic problem of agency risk right every company has that problem right every employee in theory is out for their own good and so they have to build structures so that at least to a first-order approximation the company achieved some level of good for the shareholder so yeah this is a common [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1778.74s)

place of any [[social structure]] yeah because the corporation is also a top-down system like a government is and so we can see similar issues that occur and so this is public choice theory is basically the critique of the wrongness of the incentive structures of government agents associated with markets and it's a classic libertarian critique of the regulatory process on [1800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1800.4s)

markets but so let's look like this some examples so unless i have a fully global government i'm gonna make a lot the level of say about a carbon tax or whatever at the level of us say a [[nation state]] and if anyone doesn't make that the [[nation state|nation states]] are still caught in a [[multipolar trap]] with each other so i can have multicolor trap at the level of individuals or corporations or countries [1821](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1821.01s)

or trading bloc's and so then anybody doesn't do the thing and they economically get ahead in the short term even if what they're doing is totally unbelievable aw on everyone else and this would be true for things like ai [[arms race|arms races]] this is why we tried to make a un after world war 2 is recognizing that national only governments won't stop world war so we wanted some [1849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1849.12s)

supranational force to be a monopoly force for everyone except when individual [[nation state|nation states]] have catastrophic level capacity ie they have nukes what we find is that there is no monopoly of force that can be exerted over them because to have the monopoly force work you have to be able to exert it so the un can't tell a member country that has nukes you have to get rid of [1868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1868.65s)

them because they're like we have nukes  off what are you gonna do invade us and this is one of the big problems is that the nopalea force only works when you can exert it that's why it obviously doesn't work for nuclear deep proliferation it's why it doesn't work for a lot of global issues but it's also why even as a national with the evolution or the emergence of [1885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1885.36s)

decentralized exponential technologies where small groups and non-state actors and even individuals can get catastrophic capacity through gene drives and drones and whatever if i have a gene drive pandemic type weapon connected to a deadman switch there is no rule of law that can be exerted over me and we're not that far from those types of things being possibilities so [1907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1907.86s)

this represents an emergent breakdown in the capacity for rule of law writ large and less you run a perfected surveillance state that doesn't allow anyone to have capacities which is a china strategy again i'm gonna argue here the moderate ameliorative position even though it may not actually be mine let's take the example of the carbon tax that other countries want to freeride [1928](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1928.2s)

and defect from right which you can easily see there being pressures to do so free riders and defections are the essence of [[game theory]] and at least in my mind you're [[multipolar trap]] is slight generalization of the concepts of predatory [[game theory]] so there is a personal fix whether it's enough or not i don't know which would be to have an implicit carbon tariff on imports so [1951](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1951.119s)

let's say the chinese want to defect and not collect the carbon tax we don't really care to the degree they don't collect the carbon tax that we do care but at least partially we can penalize them by putting a tariff equal to the implicit carbon tax that we would have charged for the equivalent amount of carbon in a product and in a worry especially in countries like china and [1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1973.049s)

increasingly india which are very dependent on trade this is at least a partial way of raising the cost quite significantly for those who defect or attempt to be free riders how would you respond to that yeah so let's say the u.s. agreed to do that but then let's say brazil under its new presidency says  that all buy the stuff from china and they have some capacity to and say [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=1994.95s)

russia does say some other places do china is still growing in its gdp externalizing cost and those other places are and now we're losing relative to them now you get increasing citizen pressure to revoke that law so this is again the essence of a coordination problem from the view of it make sense if we all did the good thing right in the prisoner's dilemma if we [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2016.82s)

all coordinated would be good but if we don't have the capacity to ensure the coordination anyone can defect it becomes very easy to have the strange attractor be everybody default to defection yeah the answer the prisoner's dilemma as we all know is you have tony soprano right that if you defect i'll kill ya yeah which is basically you know some kind of even worse punishment than [2035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2035.629s)

the original thing was its outside of the scenario and that ends up being how we do it right which is underneath our tariff situation we're willing to go to war to uphold a lot of these things but now let's come back to even within a country so we know that right now someone's ability to get elected has to do with largely their access to not just capital but also a lie ship so that's [2061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2061.339s)

going to affect how other representatives support them and how much they can do campaigning and media they can get and all those kinds of things and we know that we don't have an educated citizenry and so you have a situation where people are going to get elected proportional to really the incentives of the system more than anything else and because people can say [2083](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2083.27s)

stuff that isn't true and people still believe it and they can do russell conjugations to give people the wrong sense of things and appeal to emotional triggers and in-group defection dynamics and stuff like that so let's say that we try to make a law then of course everyone who has financial interest that would be damaged by that law supports the other candidate so then we have to [2101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2101.81s)

do something like campaign finance reform but who is gonna bring the campaign finance reform through this isn't of being one of the key things is that the lobbyists are paid for by somebody the people who are working to change the laws continuously are paid for by somebody and whoever it is that would the ability to get money to someone who is campaigning also is very [2121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2121.55s)

easy to hide through offshore banking and through third party entities and think tanks and whatever so because we don't have something like perfected transparent accounting if tried to bind incentive using law everyone who has the incentive to change that law has more resources than those that are trying to bind it and they end up basically winning and the gist there [2145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2145.08s)

is that economics is deeper than law is in the stack of power and so you can use law to bind economics to a limited degree but let's say again the company a country tries to put some law forth it's particularly bad for a multinational company the multinational company says i'll move headquarters to another country that doesn't do that i'll give them the taxes rather than you guys and [2166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2166.619s)

we will you know support whoever is campaigning against you and we'll put a  ton of lobbyists on changing the law this is all the critique of public choice theory is that the incentive of the agents in the system doesn't align with the well-being of the whole and the government is mediated by agents in the system and we don't have the right coordination dynamic so each actor doing [2186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2186.27s)

kind of a utility maximization function each actor doing what makes the most sense for them in the near term rationally creates a maximally stupid whole because of the misalignment in agency of the various actors and the inability to coordinate effectively across them and this gets worse with the more we can corrupt accounting the more we can actually hide that these things [2209](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2209.79s)

are occurring and the larger the system is the easier it is to do that because who can actually monitor all of the things that are happening in the system actually a lot of this was prefigured and talked about in a very underappreciated book by mansur olson called the logic of [[collective action]] i don't know if you ever read that if you haven't i would strongly recommend it [2229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2229.47s)

he's more well known for the it's the rise and decline of nations but the deeper book is the logic of [[collective action]] really as it lays out the fact that strong small groups that have a strong interest in an issue are very likely to dominate against a much broader community to have small levels of skin in the game and it you know it's a pretty strong critique and it does [2251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2251.609s)

exactly public choice but it's close that's okay let's deem that it's both who has the most incentive we'll work hardest and smaller groups can coordinate better than larger groups and this is why if i had two groups two countries say they had an equal number of people in an equal number of total dollars to begin with and one of them tried to create a law that bound [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2272.999s)

economic inequality so the richest person couldn't have more than 10x more than the poorest person the group that didn't bind economic inequality would win over the group that did in any form of warfare if the group was fairly large because if you end up getting a power-law distribution of wealth where three guys own almost everything and everybody works for them the one guy who [2292](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2292.799s)

has almost all the resource can coordinate with himself better than the million people can coordinate with each other at least so far and i think there's an interesting possibility to think about what comes next you know really all these are coordination and signaling problems right and we are operating on a single relatively low dimensional signaling and coordination [2313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2313.769s)

system that has given rise to the system that we have today what i often call the money on money return signal right molds our world so presumably if we're gonna get past this we have to think about multi-dimensional signaling and multi-dimensional coordination this is exactly the centre of what i'm focused on is that the problem is fundamentally the inability to coordinate between [2336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2336.539s)

agents where their basis for agency intrinsically has delta's right there's a what's best for me in the current system of a private balance sheet and money and those types of things which best for me is not what's best for you and best for the comments even though it would be over the long term over the short term it doesn't seem to be and so everyone is doing utility maximization [2355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2355.829s)

functions but with again unlike evolution with [[asymmetric power]] relative to the environment and supply-side relative to demand side and things like that and this then ends up creating a situation where it gets worse like this actually very important point if i have true information about the nature of reality that is a source of strategic competitive information so i want to [2378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2378.71s)

withhold that information we call this a trade secret or classified or confidential information or intellectual property but i don't just want to withhold that i also want to make sure to throw anyone else that would figure it out off the scent trail so i want to do not just withholding of information with disinformation and we have a situation where everyone is incentive to [2396](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2396.8s)

do withholding of true information and signaling of disinformation and then we have information technology that's exponential information technology where i can do customized disinformation for different persona types and all the way down to individuals we get to a world where we stop being able to parse signal from noise because there's so much radical disinformation and we have a [2416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2416.15s)

situation where a coordination actually becomes impossible because of these agency issues everywhere it's supposed to be the two different intelligence agencies within a country perfectly coordinate with each other to support that country because they're all on team country right team usa against the russians and the chinese whatever but really those two different intelligence [2433](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2433.28s)

agencies are also competing against each other for a larger percentage of the budget and then even to different departments within that organization and even to different people competing for the same promotion will withhold information and maybe even dis inform engage in corporate politics corporate politics is where someone's optimizing their own bonus structure and their [2451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2451.76s)

fealty relationships at the expense of what's actually good for the whole because they're not actually coupled to the whole effectively and so you get a situation of fractal defection everybody defecting on everyone to some degree while signaling that they're not doing that and this basically means a catastrophic breakdown in the [[sensemaking]] necessary to make good choices while having an exponentially increased amount of choice making power and if we think about that exponentially decreasing quality of [[sensemaking]] relative to the overall situation with exponentially increasing choice making power that's another way to think about inevitable collapse yes certainly recent evolutions in our information infrastructure have raised even higher [2491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2491.18s)

the power of bad faith discourse and there's nothing else it's very substantially reduced the cost of bad faith discourse right and if we talk about as we often do in our world [[sensemaking]] the idea of [[sensemaking]] and then the bigger issue of choice making in a world of predatory disinformation and bad faith discourse leaves us in a very [2511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2511.79s)

dangerous situation yeah exactly that is the central thing for us to solve all right let's stipulate now that there's no way out within the present game what do you suggest we do next okay so i would say that the consideration that rival risk games are necessarily causing harm to some other agent or to the commons but that's when they are multiplied by the leverage of [2536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2536.63s)

technology that that harm becomes larger than the ecosystem can handle if we take that as one [[generator function]] of x risk we know we have to have a situation that creates an anti rival risk basis for coordination that is necessary but not sufficient there are a couple other [[generator function|generator functions]] of x risk that we also have to address because we can show that all of the [[catastrophic risk]] this would take longer to do than we have but we can show that all the environmental degradation issues pollution issues [[dead zone|dead zones]] and ocean ocean acidification biodiversity loss species loss [[climate change]] all of those issues all of the what would cause world war three or large-scale war and all the exponential techne da 'td issues like gray goo or agi scenarios or biotech scenarios and [2579](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2579.74s)

all the things that would cause collapse grid collapse economic collapse that all of those have a few [[generator function|generator functions]] in common and we could actually do a construction where we put forward these three [[generator function|generator functions]] and prove that set is actually some some t'v that there are no risks that are not a result of those things so then coming up with a solution to those things is solving for [2602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2602.81s)

the class of what creates all of them rather than instances that becomes the kernel of a new civilization system and we can say is both necessary and sufficient requirements for a non-[[self-terminating]] civilization so complicated systems subsuming their complex substrate increased fragility and evolved systems not the technology systems we talked already about [2624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2624.77s)

evolution being different because of the nature of the metastability of evolved systems we get antifragility so if i burn a forest it will regenerate itself if i cut my body it will heal itself if i damage my laptop it won't heal itself i burn my house down it won't heal itself so humans take the antifragility of the natural world and turn it into fragile [2643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2643.37s)

stuff we turn it into simple and then complicated stuff so we turn a tree that's anti fragile and complex into a 2x4 that is simple and then a house that is complicated but both fragile but we don't stop at a certain place we basically have complicated systems subsume the [[complex system]] so we're creating an increasingly higher fragility to antifragility ratio that [2663](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2663.74s)

we're then trying to run exponentially more energy through an exponentially increasingly fragile system and this is a way of thinking about what tainter said in the collapse of complex societies which is the relationship between the complex and the complicated as we continue to grow the complicatedness of the scenario ends up breaking down and so it's important to [2684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2684.56s)

know humans only know how to build complicated stuff we don't actually know how to build complex stuff and we also don't know how to limit our growth that's what i was saying whenever there's an increase in efficiency we just exploit more stuff so this is another kind of [[generator function]] is a we both have to learn how to build stuff that is either anti fragile itself or in [2702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2702.95s)

a fundamentally different kind of well to some degree we have to build stuff that's more anti fragile and we have to not exploit all exploitable areas and so this is really different than everything we have ever done this is kind of one way of speaking about it the other thing that we can say is a [[generator function]] of x risk is that it's much easier to break stuff than it is to build new [2724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2724.94s)

stuff just from a kind of entropy or thermodynamic perspective second law of thermodynamics the one law that you can't repeat all right and so from a information theoretic perspective on the second law one way i would say it is the problem i'm interested in solving is that the way humans solve problems tends to create worse problems so whether we're talking about us coming up with a [2749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2749.21s)

and logical solution or a government solution or a kind of social ideology solution or an economic solution for the solution to solve the problem that means it overtakes the problem the solution has to be larger faster somehow bigger than the problem was but the solution typically is to solve a very narrowly defined problem so we're defining a solving one metric or two or three [2771](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2771.119s)

metrics and yet it's gonna interact with [[complex system|complex systems]] that affect lots of other metrics where we'll end up having harm externality but there will be larger than the original thing so the plow solved the problem of local famines but ended up causing desertification and [[species extinction]] and all these things writ large globally right the internal combustion engine solved the problem of [2790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2790.95s)

too much horseshit in the cities and the difficulty of horses but [[climate change]] and oil spills and wars over oil and the destabilization of the middle east are all the unintended externalities of the internal combustion engine and we can see the same for like the value of facebook then compared to the unintended externalities it created or twitter or whatever it is and so in [2812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2812.43s)

general it's because i can define a problem in a narrow way but that's actually not the problem right that's a little part of it and this is the same with biotech right it which is i can say the problem is one biometric that i'm trying to address ldl or whatever it is and i can give something that lowers that but it might also do a bunch of other things that are negative which are [2831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2831.24s)

the side effects of that thing in the overall system which is why that approach is not a really good approach to medicine and so to formalize this even further what we can say is that the information and the computation the information processing that it takes to come up with a new piece of tech is orders of magnitude less than the information processing it takes to [2851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2851.07s)

ensure that that tech won't have any externality in its long-term application and it's not just orders of magnitude we can say that the safety analysis is gonna end up being np-hard relative to the work that it takes to come up with the tech being expressible as a polynomial yes that's absolutely right one of the things i've learned in my 17 years of rolling around in [[complex system]] sciences the truth of the matter is the ability to project the future evolution of a [[complex system]] is way less than most people think if only for the very simple reason of dependency on initial conditions we know from the very simple lorenz ian strange attractors that surprisingly simple systems are effectively impossible to predict [2893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2893.279s)

because they're highly dependent on very small differences in initial conditions and when you add into that strategic agents the problem becomes i would say effectively impossible so what's the answer that basically says don't ever do anything yet we can't do that and this is the tricky thing so this is kind of why i say there's a something like a hard fork hypothesis which is if you [2912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2912.539s)

look at the history of humans the recorded history that we have at least nobody would consider us very good stewards of power we've used our power to do some lovely things and we've also used our power to torture and oppress and kill and destroy environments and whatever and everybody's done that and the few that didn't do it got killed in war by those who did do it and so let's [2933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2933.96s)

say there's a gaussian distribution on the goodness or badness of our choices the rivalry or non-rivalry of how we use our power if we have beings that are at all like the beings we have been for a long time and you exponentially increase the power of those choices itself terminates so you can't get the power of gods without the love and wisdom and prudence of gods to guide it and have [2954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2954.509s)

that be a sustainable scenario so we actually need humans to be safer vessels for power given the amount of power that we're coming into and we have no idea how to do that and what that means is we need a different basis for human choice making than we've ever had to have the level of choice making power that [[exponential tech]] is bringing about and so then we have to really get into well [2974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2974.91s)

why is it the humans are making the choices that they do and what is it that is conditioning the rival risk basis of those choices to basically have us suck with choices yes so we can talk about what are some systems that we could suggest get there but i would say that's the core of the thing that we're trying to address is how do we create a system in which any agents that are making [2994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=2994.589s)

choices are making choices that are not directly causing or indirectly causing harm to the system because that leads to the ratcheting of others doing that and that leads to self-determination and we're too powerful to do that so how do we get something like on the consideration of the agents leading to any positivity of choice making sounds nice but how do we [3013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3013.93s)

do it in a world where with the ability to project in a [[complex system|complex systems]] environment the impact of any change is well nigh impossible i would also add another thing i'd love to hear your thoughts on this one of the things we know from human anthropology is in essentially every society on earth somewhere between 1/2 of 1% and 2% of humans are sociopaths right and i'd had [3034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3034.57s)

in my experience as a corporate executive that that number may go up to 10% or more in the c-level suites and probably higher than that in the world of finance so we have this problem how do we evaluate the impact of a proposed change in a [[complex system]] which is inherently not very predictable a little bit predictable but we lose our ability to see quickly and that some noticeable [3056](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3056.32s)

percent of the actors you say 1% of sociopaths doesn't sound that bad that means in the united states there's 3 million sociopaths right and they gravitate towards power and a lot of them are pretty damn good at manipulating people how do we get across those two traps yeah if i look at all of the cluster b personality disorders in the current dsm i would say they're all [3078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3078.58s)

pretty concerning so you know not just to see apogee but narcissism and etc but the most current stats i have seen were 3 to 5 percent of the general population in the developed world tests for sociopathy and 30 percent of people in the c-suite of fortune 500 companies i'm gonna share a thought on this that i don't have all the data to back up but i don't think would be hard to come up [3101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3101.59s)

with so why do we get so much concentration of sociopathy in the top of fortune 500 companies and politics and then especially things like finance well because they're basically systems to attract reward incentivize and condition sociopathy because to get to the top the power game it's going to be people who are attracted to power and people [3122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3122.09s)

who are good at winning a bunch of win-lose games because at each step they move up the ladder they're winning against somebody else usually the involving things like disinformation and defection and whatever it is and so if you think about the nature of what a government or a corporation or any top-down power system are it is basically a strange attractor for people [3141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3141.65s)

who want to have power over for people who are running power dynamics and this is why you know let's try and save that i have a benevolent dictator well there's a reason that we don't get sustainable benevolent dictators is because let's say i have a benevolent dictator and we can get this in a corporation from great founder theory sometimes because if the founder holds [3161](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3161.27s)

the you know majority of stock in whatever but it never out lives them and usually they end up getting kicked out so let's say i have a benevolent dictator all the people who are one step under them are doing things that they require to be able to stay as a dictator because it's pretty easy to kill somebody or to oust them or whatever so if i'm at the top of a top-down power [3183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3183.05s)

system i have to keep everybody under me preferring me to be above them rather than overthrow me which means that rather than do what's best for everybody i have to do what's best largely for those who are right near me and they have to do that for those who are under them and that ensures a kind of power law distribution of power and again there's like a [[multipolar trap]] on corruption if anyone's willing to do a really up thing to try and overthrow me i have to be able to play at the game of up things where i get overthrown so we can see how top-down power systems are going to both attract condition reward incentivize things like sociopathy and so then we end up having a world run by sociopaths which is not a good thing for anybody [3221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3221.03s)

but now let's think about something like a tribe and i'm not gonna over romanticize here i'm just kind of thinking through the dynamics in a first principles way if i've got 40 50 70 up to our number of people living in a tribe there's an extraordinarily high degree of transparency that is forced in that scenario everybody pretty much sees [3241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3241.58s)

everything that's going on with everybody and everybody knows everyone everyone has fealty relationships with everybody in the tribe so sociopathy is not gonna be advantageous you're not going to have an evolutionary niche in that environment for much in the way of conspiring and lying because it will get found out and it will get punished and so the forced transparency creates an [3262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3262.4s)

accounting system where you don't get an evolutionary niche for somebody the other people in the system and so as soon as the system starts to get large enough then one there's anonymous people so i can harm people who i don't really know and care about as opposed to everybody who is in the system as somebody that i know and care about and two i can do stuff that people won't be [3282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3282.23s)

able to see they can kind of have a corruption of the accounting in the system now we get an evolutionary niche for rather than participating with the system doing internal defection i'm not externally defecting and leaving the system i'm internally defecting and playing the system and that's what most everyone inside of a corporation or a government is optimizing what is good [3303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3303.86s)

for them and their direct fealty relationships rather than what's good for the whole and nobody can tell and this is a particularly hard scenario but the reason i'm saying this is because we do our social science inside of a world where these systems have become a bic with us and then we assume that those properties where there's ubiquitous conditioning are intrinsic to [[human nature]] and i think we have to be very careful about that i think a lot of them are not intrinsic to [[human nature]] they are a result of the ubiquitous conditioning and we could create conditioning environments in which things like sociopathy are just not advantageous and so they don't get up regulated the answer probably just seem to find sociopaths the varying ratios [3342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3342.35s)

that they find them at a least half a percent ratio pretty much every place and in fact i've thrown a challenge out some anthropologist so they've not been able to reject it one of the big questions and anthropology is how did human society transition from chiefdoms to early states and my conjecture has been that it's based on the arrival of a sufficiently [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3364.76s)

charismatic sociopath and that's the story right and they've pulled their beards and that's an interesting theory here's even some ways to measure it so i think if we're gonna design a social operating system we're gonna have to assume some levels sociopathy and have some defense mechanisms for saying well so let's go ahead and do the analogy and say that sociopathy within a social body [3384](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3384.89s)

is like a cancer cell inside of a animal body which is not cancer cells inside of a human body are doing something that is good for them and good for the other cells around and good for the whole simultaneously and they have an evolved coordination system to be not in rival risk dynamic with each other the heart and the lungs are not rivalries with each other they're not competing to [3405](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3405.109s)

extract scarce resource and order they're in this you know kind of radically necessarily symbiotic relationship now a cancer cell realizes that it can actually consume and reproduce faster if it defects on the agreement and that happens all the time but that cancer cell is only able to affect the cells immediately around it and so then they're able to either fix [3423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3423.589s)

the cell or kill it and limit its effective action if the cancer cell could broadcast uncle genes to all cells in the body simultaneously because it had something like technology to be able to leverage what it wanted to do we'd be  and so when we think about the world today and the capacity that exponential technology gives for anyone to have a much stronger coupling to the [3444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3444.71s)

whole system not mediated through having to have that flow through a bunch of other agents where error correction can occur this is one of the things that's really problematic with the world today is it's even small numbers of people that become sadistic sociopathic whatever can really the whole system up and so you actually have to have something that creates [3464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3464.99s)

antifragility for this particular thing and so we can say to have a system that doesn't have catastrophic collapses eminence it has to be able to limit this and one way of doing it is the china strategy which is a bit of surveillance and anyone does anything that looks at all concerning and there hours removed from them and i would argue that that system will also [3487](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3487.109s)

inexorably collapse because even though it won't collapse because of [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] it'll collapse because we noticed that markets are much better at innovation bottom-up processes are much better at innovation than top-down processes tend to be if you control the bottom-up processes that rigorously you won't end up being able to innovate enough to keep up with changing [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3507.39s)

environments and you'll fail too red queen dynamics that's my prediction for the china strategy but what i would say is that a tribe is actually like a family and a tribe or a village is actually a really good method for being able to do surveillance and i mean a very healthy rather than a up type of surveillance it's not a top-down one-to-many surveillance [3528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3528.77s)

it's a many-to-many and where the goal does not prevent someone from doing bad things but actually caring about people and so rather than the sesame credit version or the institute a religious idea where everyone shames everyone out of fear of god version this is a have a situation where no one can actually be a shut-in right we noticed that when somebody goes and shoots a bunch of [3549](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3549.45s)

people up with ar-15 typically they weren't in interaction with a lot of other humans they were able to because of modern society they were able to live for a while where afterwards and interviews their neighbors say we never saw him he was real quiet he kept to himself he never came out as we have increasing technological capacity to agents we can't have agents that can [3567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3567.69s)

evolve in their psychopathology unchecked we also can't have situations where they are interacting that they can hide the results so we need something like both real accounting of what's happening and everyone having to interact with other people in local ways that ensure the health of people and if not actually take care of them so that's one of the first things i can talk about [3588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3588.839s)

is that as long as the defect on the whole is more advantageous just two things one is as long as the defect on the whole is more advantageous than participate with it it will happen and so you have to have the kinds of accounting that keep that from occurring and the other thing is as long as individuals can become psychologically damaged and have [3609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3609.18s)

that not be noticed and still have access to power that's also a problem so there is a process by which the psychologic health of people has to be noticed and the process by which the [[social system]] has to be more advantageous to participate with and to defect against you have some ideas and how we might structure this sound like a cell network essentially where people [3631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3631.529s)

are assembled at the [[dunbar number]] or below in an intense solid way and presumably with minimal ability to migrate because we all know that the stranger in town is a much riskier character than the person's that's been around for 30 years talk a little bit about how that might actually be accomplished i am gonna go somewhere that's gonna be really bothersome i [3651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3651.299s)

don't know of any model where that's accomplishable as long as there's private property okay we certainly have alternatives such as syndicalism which is quasi private property but not in the same sense we have here and then there's an rg which is another similar model so i don't think we have to keep private property on the table so i would entertain any proposal that you think [3672](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3672.42s)

could implement this theory i think if organs believed that they could live at the expense of the other ones and that a famine might come so they needed to hoard resource because they wouldn't be able to get it from other ones and they were actually in competition for scarce resource we'd be  right the body would break down very very quickly and so you don't see [3689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3689.22s)

the coordination dynamics of cells or organs or tissues involving something like private property you have a situation where things are stored wherever they're stored the calcium stored in the bones fat cells are so really they are for the utilization by any part of the system that needs it as it's needed so you don't have a situation where any cell or organ has a [3708](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3708.18s)

delta between what's good for it and what's good for the whole cuz it depends upon the rest of the whole i do believe that we have to create a similar thing in the human systems and specifically my ability to increase my own private property ownership my own balance sheet increases my quality of life not only can id couple that from you or the commons i can ante couple it i can [3730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3730.17s)

directly the commons or you and get ahead in that way that becomes the basis for misaligned agency and i think we assume that basis for misaligned agency kind of across the board and of course i'm not going to present something like marxism but i think if you actually study something like how the resource provisioning of something like a body works [3748](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3748.94s)

it is obviously neither socialism or marxism or capitalism it's a much more [[complex system]] with different underlying axioms and so let's say that rather than you possess a good in order to have access to it your capacity to access it is to be a possession but your possession means that i no longer have access to it and the scarce or something is the more value we give to it so then [3769](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3769.25s)

we also have a incentive to create artificial scarcity because abundance makes the stuff not worth anything and you also then have an incentive to possess more stuff than you need especially when you get compounding returns on the stuff that you have so your incentive is to extract as much it is possible to drive scarcity in the system to hoard information to cause [3789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3789.02s)

disinformation all of those things associated with the private ownership type advantages so then anything that you own that i no longer have access to i'm not stoked on you owning stuff right i'm actually don't want you to own the stuff i want to own the stuff if instead you have access to something that is part of a common wealth resource where your access doesn't remove my access via [3810](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3810.829s)

possession like shopping carts at the grocery store because there is enough of them for peak-time everybody doesn't have to bring their own shopping cart which would be a pain in the ass take a lot more resources and you know obviously be more difficult so you having access to smother me a dog doesn't live in my access we start to say how many places could this be the [3829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3829.73s)

case and we see that with the sharing economy we could replace transportation comprehensively with common wealth shared resources rather than possessed resources have just enough for peak time plus maintenance which would be something like a twentieth of the total number that are there now have them be higher quality for everybody and obviously lower accidents higher quality [3850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3850.099s)

much lower cost to civilization because you don't have a bunch of grotesque duplication and you don't have having to go to marketing budgets and financial services it just goes to product developments you don't have designed in obsolescence you have modular upgrade ability built right into the system so you can see a much higher quality of life for everyone with a much [3868](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3868.09s)

lower load on the system and you also then remove the destructive competitive dynamics in doing so now let's say that rather than have a central company like an uber whatever mediating that which now still has a misalignment of agency we use something like a [[blockchain]] type system to be able to make that actually a common wealth resource where the money that would be extracted from the system [3891](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3891.97s)

doesn't need to be extracted from the system you start to see oh we could actually create things that are like commonwealth access based dynamics were you having access doesn't decrease my access that it's actually better than that that would just be non rival risk rival risks is your access mediated through possession decreases mind so  you rival risk is an t coupled your well-being and mine are actually ante coupled non-rival risk is just uncoupled which all argue is not strong enough ante rival risk is rigorously positively coupled your well-being in mind go up and down together so in a situation where you have access to the transportation and access to other commonwealth resources it actually [3929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3929.05s)

increases your capacity to be creative now you can also get to the maker studio into the art studio to make art and music and your motive isn't to get money by selling the art because you already have access to all the things that money would normally give you so getting stuff doesn't confer advantage and also doesn't grant identity your identity is now only gonna come not through what you [3948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3948.19s)

get out of the system but by what you create and contribute to the system and we don't get the same zero-sum dynamics on contribution to a system through creativity as you do through getting stuff because it's much harder to compare a salvador dali and an mc escher than it is dollars and dollars right the creativity ins of being non fungible yeah very high-dimensional right and so [3968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3968.17s)

now if i have a system where if you don't get stuff you die and then if you don't get stuff you don't breed and then if you don't get stuff you don't self actualized at every level of maslow's hierarchy you have to get stuff and you're getting stuff involves other people not having stuff that's the best way to condition greed jealousy and sociopathy and everybody [3986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=3986.44s)

and then call it [[human nature]] if i have a situation in which having access to those things is a given and it's utterly boring and the only way that you actually have self-actualization is through that you create but as other people are more creative the commonwealth that you live in is better and you actually have access to more stuff then you both have a much [4003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4003.29s)

better basis for real creativity that's one master not two masters and you're also incentive to support everyone else to sell factorize because your life is directly better when they do so in a world where you have access to the transportation and the maker studios and whatever then i get a listen to better music and have access to better so this is one part of it is how we move [4021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4021.35s)

from rival risks through non rival risk to anti rival risks is we have to have situations where we are actually coupling our incentive and our agency rather than having it ante coupled and so there's much more to say about it but this is one example now here's the key part i will buy that this would be great if we could do it in fact jordan green hall and i and some other folks cooked [4044](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4044.78s)

up fairly naive political program several years ago and we identified maximizing self-actualization as the highest goal and we weren't as structured as this thinking but we had some things that were moving in this direction which eventually became a concept called [[game b]] but [[game b]] at that point at least failed because it couldn't convince any of us or at least [4064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4064.58s)

that critical mass of us that there was a reasonable way to get from here to there you know the current system is pretty damn optimized for doing what it does and how do you get people to switch from the current activities that they're engaged in which are relatively economically optimized to this new alternative system that's the hard question and i would put to you that [4089](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4089.45s)

that transition from game a to [[game b]] is the part that so far many of us have never seen a reasonable path yeah so first i think an adequate blueprint for [[game b]] has to become clear and so we have to say that we have a set of architectures that mean necessary and sufficient criteria otherwise know how to reverse engineer then yes there has to be an implementation path [4113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4113.2s)

first i want to say that i don't think the current system is close to economically optimized and this actually a very important point let's say that i'm one of the richest people in the world today and bill gates or warren buffett or whatever there's really important stuff that the world could produce that it can't inside of capitalism that i don't have access to [4132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4132.819s)

and this is actually kind of everywhere and it's really basic the best phone the science could make involve some intellectual property owned by apple and some owned by google and some owned by a few different companies and the same is true with the best laptop in the best car and even with ilion's of dollars i can't buy that thing and all the things that i can buy are produced by someone [4152](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4152.859s)

where not only do they have limited ip but they also have whatever designed and obsolescence and desire for proprietary stuff so you use the rest of their ecosystem stuff so it's not interoperable i have to deal with that shitty sub optimality even from the richest guy in the world goddamn apples the perfect example right at one level they have some beautiful [4171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4171.339s)

engineering nice integration but on the other side they're you they're  you the at you all the time right it's amazing  you and the environment and people and all kinds of things right and so then i go to things like okay let's take a look at and this might be more controversial but i don't think it should be let's take a look at biotech [4191](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4191.29s)

and health research there's a whole bunch of that makes sense to research where there's just no money to research it so we did so much work in small molecules because they were patentable and it was really critical they were patentable because if i had to go through fda trials that cost a billion dollars and i needed to make that money back i had to be able to have [4207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4207.58s)

the patent on the thing so that people couldn't undercut me just on cost of goods so we were only gonna research it was patentable the patentable stuff was only gonna be synthetic stuff because you don't want people to be able to patent intrinsic parts of humans or nature so that means that anything that was a part of how my body worked when i was healthy doesn't get to be something [4225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4225.04s)

i do research on because i won't be able to ever make the money on that research and a synthetic molecule that wasn't part of the [[evolutionary environment]] it wasn't part of how my body worked when it was healthy it doesn't even make sense that that would actually be a real cure and that's the only shortened research and of course i live in a world where war is more likely in the [4242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4242.74s)

environment as factual reasons that even from the richest person in the world i can't control and where near-term [[catastrophic risk]] affects everybody including me so i think today even the wealthiest people if they are willing to think about it can recognize that the world that we are discussing if it was possible as comprehensively better for them and the current world is the mature [4263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4263.02s)

i believe that but i try to sell that to peter thiel yeah so i won't name names but i have had conversations like this with many people of that class and both in the face of the inexorability of [[catastrophic risk]] and the incapacity for this system to produce some really important stuff and they would care about a lot of people are increasingly capable of recognizing that they just [4285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4285.73s)

don't feel like they know how to initiate the new system either well that's good news actually and of course you know i think ecocide is at now becoming the forcing function anyone who is really thinking seriously about this stuff has to realize that we are have either already overshot or are about to overshot the carrying capacity of the earth and that alone ought to be a [4307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4307.39s)

pretty strong argument to go on a different road but as we talked about before people are locked into these rival risk structures and their fractal in their nature they're a goodly amount of their self definition is about where they sit in this complex multi-leveled pecking order that's a big lift to get three hundred and thirty million americans let alone a billion people in [4326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4326.53s)

the world to retreat from the game a hierarchical fractal structure and move towards something else yeah everyone is stuck in a kind of [[multipolar trap]] regarding incapacity to coordinate better because let's say i got a billionaire and they say okay well that makes sense but i have no idea how to build a new system and i have no idea how to get people to participate with a [4346](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4346.0s)

new system and as long as other people are doing the thing then it doesn't seem like there is any other game for me to play it's kind of like there is really only one game in town so if we can even take like let's say kilo and musk as an interesting example where okay argue one of the highest agency people in the world currently right and after he came [4361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4361.12s)

across boström stuff he became very concerned about [[existential risk]] from agi created open ai to work on it and then when you saw him on joe rogan a few months ago he was saying i spent years trying to get the world to understand this agi issue and to create different you know safety protocols and their own incentive to be their first first mover advantage whatever is such that i can't [4382](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4382.84s)

do anything about it and i basically have kind of given up on being able to protect against this risk and all we can do now is just hope that the risk isn't terrible and try to mitigate it so if even the most agentic powerful people feel like they actually don't have the capacity to do anything in the presence of you know [[multipolar trap]] type dynamic since like alright how do you do it this [4403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4403.57s)

is the transition question well one thing is the what is the new thing you transition to has never been adequately specified so we have to be able to specify something that meets the solution to these [[generator function|generator functions]] and again that's a longer conversation but we could go further we're starting to lay some of the ground work and as far as transition goes i'll share one [4421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4421.21s)

example of a way to think about it i'm not saying this is how it will happen i'm saying this at least provides a [[thought experiment]] first there is no such thing as sustained competitive advantage from a single innovation because if i have an innovation whether it's better extraction tech or economic tech or [[social tech]] or warfare tech the moment i deploy that capacity then [4443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4443.08s)

everyone else will see it reverse-engineer it you know make their own kind of innovations on it and so sustained competitive advantage is an ongoing innovation competition which is the up ratcheting of rival risk power which is the dynamic that we're looking at here and so there's this question most people get stuck in which is like okay well the current system seems to be [4462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4462.7s)

[[self-terminating]] so if we need to make a new system that outcompetes this system what source of asymmetric advantage over the current system is it gonna have and how does that not just is that not just part of the same power game because we're used to thinking in terms of outcompetes and so like if you think historically that there were less violent cultures [4479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4479.44s)

that invested less in military and more in quality of life arts and sciences and humanity and lived in more harmony with the environment and lower population they just got slaughtered by the warring cultures and then when the warring cultures intersected the most successful one subsumed these successful parts of the other one and there was this basically distillation of [4497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4497.78s)

successful warfare capacity then we're like okay well we don't want to try and beat tibet in the presence of china again or any of those scenarios so i can't make some nonviolent thing that will simply just get killed and yet whatever else i create if that isn't the case seems like it's still just competing at the game of power so what is the option so there's a question [4515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4515.12s)

of what could provide increased capacity that can't be weaponized that's a very interesting question we could say that every technology that increases capacity can be weaponized meaning can be used by some agent to increase their capacity relative to other agents or the commons except if we had a social technology that was anti rival risks but it actually produced increased coordination [4540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4540.949s)

capacity you actually can't weaponize it because it is the solvent for weapon ization itself it is actually the basis of how agents interact in a way that doesn't incentivize weapons and so for anyone to instantiate that thing they are actually changing the nature of their agency so in the current system again private balance sheet i'm in a big corporation i'm gonna do the thing that [4564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4564.56s)

optimizes my bonus structure and my status and the company even if it other people in the company and the company as a whole and that might include spreading disinformation withholding information etc well let's say i could create a situation where i couldn't get ahead of the expense of the whole so i had both the right kind of transparency and accounting systems and [4584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4584.03s)

access to commonwealth resources where only as the commonwealth does better do i do better and things like that then we can have a situation where no one let's just say if we could invent a situation in which no one had an actual incentive to spread disinformation or to hoard information if they shared true and maybe they'd be wrong but they at least had the incentive for full earnestness [4608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4608.04s)

and full transparency if you had a situation where that was the incentive you figured out how to do that and i will say there is a way to do that i believe there's a way to do that then you would get a situation where you had an information ecology that was actually intact at a larger scale that would lead to radically better capacity to coordinate and innovate better since [4628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4628.17s)

making the current system has in that system as a whole would be more effective at producing all of the metrics that matter relative to total resource per capita than any current system would be and i only need a small number of people relatively small number of people who get that and want to instantiate it as a new full stack civilization to create a new strange [4647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4647.97s)

attractor or a new attractor basin where anyone else looking at it says well quality of life is higher on every metric there and they're also able to innovate us on a bunch of things they're figuring out solutions to that we don't have well then why don't we just kill them well because they aren't trying to win the game of power against us they aren't building militaries or [4666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4666.03s)

signaling or [[narrative warfare]] to try and beat us and actually they're exporting solutions to us that we need to the rest of the world because if they have increased capacity to innovate and solve problems because they can actually coordinate better because they don't have disinformation information withholding then they can look at what groups that would otherwise have enmity [4682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4682.77s)

with them actually need develop those solutions and create dependents rather than enmity relationships while simultaneously saying if you want to know how to do this as well we've actually open sourced it it's a social technology you're welcome to use the social technology but the social technology will fundamentally change your basis for agency if you employ it [4698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4698.31s)

so obviously there's a million things we would need to dig into there but just the [[thought experiment]] goes fast the doctors build a new ground-up system where the new ground-up system becomes a new attractive basin and you know that's a way of thinking about that i don't try and if i have to shift at the level of axioms i can't retrofit current system i have to build something [4718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4718.739s)

but if the thing that i build is fundamentally more attractive ground up then i only need fast adopters to understand it in concept to have medium adopters understand that after seeing its implementation i really like that and in fact when you were talking about the lack of sustainable competitive advantage from any single innovation i was thinking there's a soft counter [4739](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4739.409s)

example it's not good forever but it's what we call network effects right and if we spend what you just said a little bit suppose we were able to create a strong beneficial network effect to people who played by positive generative rules and did so in a way that was not directly threatening back to people who didn't play by the rules but because these people were better sense makers [4762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4762.69s)

and choice makers they actually could create things to trade back to people who aren't on the network and of course as we know the early adopter a types will come and join the network and once it's proven to be more successful per unit of human effort at both well being but also importantly actual creation the next layer of people will come in if only to hang out with the a's and then [4784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4784.86s)

you make that as you said i think this was the brilliant part that i hadn't thought of before you make the ground rules such that anyone who becomes a member has essentially committed to a doctrine which is subversive of the previous paradigm but in a subtle way not directly challenging at just a value orientation and a set of rules for dealing with each other and this again [4806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4806.849s)

gets very much back to the original naive spirit of [[game b]] where one of the things we did was gave ourselves all the title of peer we always said that when you're dealing with another [[game b]] person you have a moral obligation of considerable power to deal with them as a peer irrespective of any other different other dimensions of power differences and so if this strong [4828](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4828.09s)

beneficial network effect system had as an example that anyone who's a member of it is within the constraints of the system at least a true peer that would be very interesting yeah so i can only compete on a define and narrow metric right so if we're competing over who has more money or who's taller who can run then we can just have a straight-up competition but how do i compare dolly [4851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4851.54s)

techer it's a up thing right you actually kind of can't do that in a meaningful way and any way that you try to say well here's a metric or some set of metrics with which to assess that you've actually reduced the thing to something it isn't and so you could imagine that an usher and a dolly could interact with each other in a way where they both acknowledge that each other [4872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4872.93s)

are bringing something to the world that is actually enriching the world and beautiful that they aren't bringing and that they're stoked each other doing it and there's no hierarchy intrinsic in that and i'm not saying there are never healthy hierarchies but i'm saying in general rather than a competition on a very narrow metric which is inherently information reduction we are seeking [4888](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4888.62s)

self-actualization of rich creativity and that intrinsically can't be holistically compared in the same way so that's one big part of it and the other part of it is you know that you and i had a conversation the other day jim where you said something and you and i are just getting to know each other and like i instantly loved you because of it because you said anyone who would abuse [4910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4910.55s)

people with a below 90 iq i want to beat their head and with a baseball bat or something like that and you wanted to see that those who have more intelligence are actually protective of rather than exploiting of those who couldn't compete so then the question is what made you that way and how do we create [[social system|social systems]] where to the extent that anyone has obviously [4930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4930.05s)

increased capacity over anyone else they're actually oriented to steward everyone else rather than use that in an exploitive way and i think this is conditional both at the level of social values and at the level of the way values are codified in a value equation ie the economics and the [[social system]] wow i think we should wrap it here we could go on for three more hours but i [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psdN65IzOw&t=4952.31s)
