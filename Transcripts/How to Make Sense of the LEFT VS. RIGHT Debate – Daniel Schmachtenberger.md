let's say we take kind of political left and political right i d ology there's a gazillion examples and what we call the political left and right today might seem actually quite different than what it was in the past so let's take a kind of what had previous to recently been kind of some essential ideas and republican or democrat platforms so we kind of have this republican right oriented idea of wanting to empower the [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=23.66s)

self responsibility and sovereignty of the individual and more individualistic and so smaller government less social services more empowering of those who are entrepreneurial and pull themselves up by their bootstraps and you know that kind of thing and then you have the kind of more democratic left perspective that says well and here it's saying the collective is actually created by the [51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=51.21s)

individual so we want to empower the individuals that are creative and take agency because better individuals make a better whole that's kind of the gist over here it's like well but the individuals are being conditioned by the environment that they're born into by the whole and so even though i can't find that one story of that one guy who pulled themselves up by the bootstraps [68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=68.729s)

and the ghetto there's a whole lot more people that succeeded who were born into the hamptons and born into south central and so let's create better environments that actually condition better people because there's top-down effects the holes create affecting the individuals so there's there's for many people some seemingly compelling truth in both of these and also problems right so there [91](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=91.95s)

can be a right oriented perspective that says hey look if we set up social services in welfare and whatever we actually condition shittier people who are less strong and resilient in the face of the environment we d incentivize those who are most entrepreneur and creative like what and we make people who are doing badly still do well and that actually kind of down regulates the [123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=123.36s)

evolutionary pressure in the whole system like why would we want to do that and of course over here we can have a kind of left perspective that says yeah but some people are getting ahead using shared services that the government pays for from everybody's tax money that they aren't actually really accounting for and they're affecting the commons negatively in a way that is [140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=140.4s)

externalizing the cost everyone else so that they're being claimed to be more entrepreneurial it just means they're extracting from the commons and externalizing cost to the commons better and do we do we really want to let people die on the footsteps of hospitals because they don't have money or insurance you know in the fully individualistic libertarian kind of idea [164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=164.22s)

and fully libertarian kind of ideology can't solve [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and so like but there's there's clearly truth in both of these and they are clearly neither complex enough to actually handle reality in which there are bottom-up effects where the individuals effect the whole and there's also a top-down effects for the wholes in turn affect the individual and there's [186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=186.42s)

feedback and feed-forward loops and neither of them are factoring those enough but the debate process doesn't bring about dialectic right the debate process is here actually make the idea more polarized to get people on this side emphasize rhetoric over real [[sensemaking]] and emphasize winning over collectively trying to make sense together so the debate process is not a [206](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=206.73s)

good [[sensemaking]] process it's a [[narrative warfare]] process dialectic is different which says okay i think we have some truth and not all of it i think you have some let's endeavor together earnestly to figure out the things that we're all interested in figuring out and then we start to say okay well do we want that do we want better individuals who are more [229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=229.14s)

sovereign independent of environment dot nobody doesn't want that or do we want holes that support all the individuals within them to do better well duh we want that too but the way that we've done social services makes oftentimes some of them makes the people not more sovereign but more dependent so it's actually not making better people it's making more comfortable but shittier [252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=252.57s)

people right and the way that we incent individuals over here in sense people who are entrepreneurial but by externalizing costs to the commons and creating radical wealth inequality so it's incentivizing the most truly creative and intelligent and good people it's incentivizing effective sociopathy and things like that so like neither of [270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=270.79s)

these are doing all that good at the thing they're even claiming to do so how do we create social services collective processes that condition healthier people who are more sovereign how do we create environments that condition people who do better in any environment right that actually conditions strength and resilience and sovereignty in the individuals who then in turn affect the [291](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=291.43s)

environments in ways that support the increased sovereignty of everybody else that's a totally higher-order way of starting to think about the relationship between them that starts to recognize the inexorable failing of both of those perspectives and and that what the approach would take is more complex right that's an example of starting to move towards synthesis from a thesis and [316](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=316.87s)

an antithesis right and if you if you look at even personal things in your life you're wrestling with like okay do i want to accept and love reality and people and myself as i am or do i want to like help strive to make things better there they're similar like those types of things you'll find a thesis antithesis everywhere or the actual insight to synthesis is novel insight [341](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=341.68s)

not contained in either of those if i when i say accept you as you are right now or help work to change you to make you better and i see those as as different it's because i'm seeing you as a noun and i'm seeing you as a fixed thing or accept you as you are you are this current state whereas if i see you as a process if i see you as a verb i see you as a becoming that is different [368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=368.95s)

than you were yesterday and different than you were when you were two right then accepting you as you are and includes dynamism includes the impulse to change grow and evolve so i can accept you fully as you are which in love you is you are which includes accepting and loving the impulse to grow and expand and include and transcend so i can support you to become more not on [387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=387.669s)

the basis of judging you as insufficient but loving you completely including loving the evolutionary trajectory inside right but that insight of you as a verb rather than as a noun was actually not captured in either of these so the dialectic process of saying like okay well how do i see the partial truth here construct this fully and then how do i [408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=408.28s)

see the partial truth here construct this fully and then what new insights bring these together in the higher order perspective that is more complex and more nuanced than either of them so that's kind of a dialectic process and it might not just be to thesis antithesis might be the lots of perspectives this is it - i would this is a process that i would love to see [435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=435.7s)

people start practicing at for [[sensemaking]] of whenever they're talking with someone start by seeking to understand before seeking to be understood and seek for the truth value and what people are saying not just the wrongness but then don't holistically throw out what they're saying is totally wrong or totally true be able to separate that there is signal and noise and then be [456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=456.34s)

able to say if i see signal from a number of sources how does that fit together into higher-order perspective this this is another [[sensemaking]] process you mentioned emotion and vulnerability as key components of [[sensemaking]] could you that may seem a little bit counterintuitive to people can you explain what you mean by that if i want [480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=480.72s)

to make sense of the world well and i'm gonna engage in some communication processes with other people to make sense of the world as i'm a collective [[sensemaking]] then i want them to share true information with me to not dis inform nor withhold so how do i create the trust and psychological safety for them to do that well i'm probably gonna have to do that too and so how do we [508](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=508.78s)

create mutual trust and psychologic safety that we're not going to use the information that we're sharing with each other in [[game theory|game theoretic]] ways with each other that's a huge part and if people don't have some spaces and some relationships where they feel like they can actually share fully openly honestly and feel trust in that their [[sensemaking]] is going to be radically curtailed right to what they can just do on their own and without anybody's ability to help error correct them with full sharing also one of the sources of bias is identifying with what i believe because it because i'm identifying with part of an in-group that believes that thing or because i am special or smart or right or whatever for believing that thing said the the impulse to be right [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=566.579s)

means that i won't seek to understand other perspectives and so if i'm gonna actually seek to understand the truth value in other perspectives like earnestly trying to get what they are seeing what where they're coming from i have to stop seeing it the way that i'm seeing it for a little while and i also have to completely suspend debate and [[narrative warfare]] and the impulse to be right and all of that and so there is a deeper human connection that's involved there's also something there's a psychological process that almost seems like a spiritual process where for me to really try and get where you're coming from on a topic i have to really take your perspective well what is it in me that is taking your perspective cuz it's not my perspective right it it is [625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=625.11s)

actually having to drop the way that i see things to really try and see it the way that you see things to make sense of it so that means that it is some come if there's a capacity in me that can witness my perspective it can also witness your perspective but it is deeper than the current perspective i have and we all know we can change our beliefs and there's still something that [645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNO_3JFLVUc&t=645.959s)

is us so there is a us ness that is deeper than the belief system to be able to really try to make sense of someone else i actually have to move into that level of self that is deeper than belief systems
