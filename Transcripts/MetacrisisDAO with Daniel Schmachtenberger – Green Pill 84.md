foreign [[music]] ation on this podcast episode i've got daniel schmackenberger he's returning uh this is my third episode with daniel schmachtenberger and i think that i get a dm like once every other week asking me when the next episode with daniel is coming out so i'm finally uh really excited to have an answer to that question he's back we're talking about [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=22.439s)

the [[metacrisis]] and how we could use [[web3]] to address it how we can map out the different vertical and horizontal areas of the [[metacrisis]] and uh for those of you who are just tuning in tuning in uh the [[metacrisis]] is basically this uh [[game theory|game theoretic]] idea of an underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises so things like [[climate change]] biodiversity collapse uh existential ai [47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=47.0s)

risk [[existential risk]] in general and basically the idea is how can we use technology in order to help address or start to address the catastrophes which is [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] things like [[climate change]] bio diversity collapse but also the dystopias that result from using governance systems trying to solve for [[coordination failure]] creating authoritarian governments uh through [70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=70.979s)

regulation that try to regulate [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] how to create a [[third attractor]] that creates coordination but without the [[dystopia]] that's kind of the idea of the [[metacrisis]] or i guess one of the ideas with the [[metacrisis]] so if you've listened to episodes one and two you know that daniel is just this incredibly articulate lucid thinker who cares so [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=89.82s)

deeply about figuring out how to address the [[metacrisis]] because it's just so important and existential and um i really i really find daniel to be this inspiring thinker and um catalyst for thinking about how to uh how to how to think about the [[metacrisis]] and um so in this episode we we kind of build on the work that was done in [113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=113.7s)

episodes one and two if you haven't listened to daniel spock newberger greenpill episode one and two click the links in the show notes and listen to that first i just gave you a quick quick tldr but um the listening to those episodes will be time well spent and definitely advise listening to episodes one and two before you listen to episode three in episode [131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=131.879s)

three we talk about creating an attractor for web three people to to come together and start to build a taxonomy of the what of the [[metacrisis]] [[metacrisis]] dow.com is the launch that we're doing on this episode today so basically a discourse forum where people can come together and they can talk about the [[metacrisis]] they can uh daniel has given us five prompts at the end of [153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=153.18s)

the episode about things that the [[web3]] community could start doing in order to address the [[metacrisis]] to map out the [[metacrisis]] and um so metacrisdao.com is going to be this channel for people to come together and to for the web 3 community to start supporting daniel's work and i'm just so excited to finally bring you this bring you this episode like i said daniel uh having daniel back [175](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=175.8s)

was one of my most requested audience requests over twitter dms so um i think i've said enough let's get onto the episode you are really gonna gonna love this one coordination without further ado i give you daniel schmackenberger the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty goes down glow is a [195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=195.78s)

dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates [[basic income]] for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe reserve to give directly's [[basic income]] program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glowdollar.org greenpill that's gro dollar dot org [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=236.22s)

slash greenpill working in [[web3]] is awesome but working outside of the typical w-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work tax time is coming up opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity generate proof of employment through pay subs and receive [258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=258.959s)

denver make sure to stop by the office booth or attend their future of work summit hosted by opus hey daniel what's up hey kevin happy to finally be back for this episode three yeah yeah same glad to have you well i guess we we started off with doing an episode about uh what is the [[metacrisis]] was episode one and then episode two we started talking [320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=320.88s)

about criteria for addressing the [[metacrisis]] we were planning on doing an episode three and four which were i think around how things like web three or technology in general could address the [[metacrisis]] and i think that that got a little bit side railed so um i'd be curious kind of what you've been up to and how your thinking has evolved since we recorded episode two [339](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=339.96s)

with respect to addressing the [[metacrisis]] with technology yeah yeah so the reason i was excited to do this podcast series with you after we met at the you asked me to come to the [[schelling point]] conferences um there are so many people in the web 3 community that are focused on things [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=360.539s)

that are pretty core to [[metacrisis]] stuff how do we do better decentralized coordinations that can either de-necessitate institutions or actually enable institutions or fundamentally new kinds of institutions deal with the information singularity deal with deep fakes deal with corruption deal with provenance you know like really important things and there's a pretty stark contrast from the hopes in those areas to you know where the space is at in terms of fulfillment on them and um where most of the attention in the space has actually gone and i do think that um the decentralized computing uh uncorruptable ledgers the whole field of you know kind of  __  cryptographic [407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=407.58s)

tools that you'd call [[web3]] uh is extremely important emerging area of tech it's not a single technology obviously but a suite of technologies where the the technologies do portend really interesting solutions to some deep issues that are not like specific topic issues but generalized underlying issues they also make possible new issues that [430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=430.44s)

didn't exist before and uh it's not that common that you get to be at the beginning of the emergence of an entirely new field of tech especially you know in this kind of post-internet era where it has the capability of having global autopoetic impact relatively quickly and being able to shape such a space is a big deal and [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=455.22s)

specifically separating out all of the how can we inflate a token value from how do we actually identify the meaningful regenerative crypto economics project i felt like you did an exceptional job of attracting the community of people who were interested in the actually interesting things so yeah in our first podcast it was let's kind of give this [[metacrisis]] frame what what is the whole set of global [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] and wicked problems the world is facing and what are the underlying dynamics that give rise to them to have some sense of what is actually needed what is worth doing what is a problem definition that is deep and rich enough to actually start to think about how one would go about solving it [502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=502.08s)

and then in uh the second session we actually mostly addressed the way that technologies can affect human values individually like have psychological effects on people and have cultural effects and because the fact that a technology can have unintended consequences physically to the environment like you make a pesticide that you intend to be a [525](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=525.779s)

pesticide and you didn't intend that it was going to cause cancer or things like that uh there's physical externalities but there are also psychosocial externalities and if you really want to ensure that the development of technologies doesn't cause psychosocial externalities that are negative and maybe ones that are positive and design [541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=541.2s)

it in you've got to kind of understand that so that's where we left and we were going to like you said months ago go into part three and start saying okay so what are novel problems that the [[blockchain]] space could cause because every new type of technology makes new possibility new affordances new capacities and there are no such thing as new types of technology [563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=563.94s)

that don't have some uh harmful application so let's think through that and say how do we ensure that the positive relative to the negative applications are more likely to proliferate how do we bind them is their regulation to put in mind um and whether we're talking about uh hard to penetrate  __  up black [582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=582.68s)

markets you know or um auto poetic social processes that once put into place can never be changed um you know there are some kind of serious things to think about there's also what are the most important and interesting problems that [[blockchain]] could solve that whether or not they are the flashiest from a token value are [605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=605.16s)

like the ones that people who really want to solve global problems should think about and we were going to address that and but obviously we don't know all the answers to that we don't even know close to all the answers to that and so now i see why you're asking the what's been nuisance there are some major global institutions that asked the [624](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=624.899s)

org that i work with to um to write addendums to or help them with their global risk report global [[catastrophic risk]] reports and we're in the process of doing that and some of that work will come out later this year and being able to think through all of the emerging technology category areas from synthetic biology to [[artificial intelligence]] to you know etc and think through both what are the risks associated and the problems that could be solved and what is the combo of the technology the regulatory landscape the incentives etc that could move it in the right direction i asked you if you thought there was a group of people in your extended community that might want to do deeper research and has already [671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=671.88s)

been done on answering those questions regarding [[web3]] and so we decided to do this podcast to not actually answer those questions but to kind of state what the questions are why they're important as a invitation for people to participate who are interested in helping uh helping analyze how this emerging field [694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=694.56s)

of technology can should be guided in the kind of biggest frameworks possible which i think is extremely exciting and i think it's really really rad that you took the initiative to start to put a format together where people could come collaborate so that's where we're at here and i am excited to dive into uh the questions today yeah same so you know one of the things that really stuck out from i forgot it was episode one or episode two that we did together but i think you said something to the effect of a problem well understood is is half addressed um and and i think if i could summarize what you said about where we we've been over the last four to six months you [740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=740.04s)

were kind of doing all these these risk reports for uh institutions uh about the [[metacrisis]] and consulting on a one-on a one-off basis and this year you've instead of doing these like one-off reports for these individual institutions it's about building a um community or a resource that's kind of like live updating and can help understand and address the [[metacrisis]] in in a way that's that both respects its complexity and doesn't reduce it um down and and that sort of serves us becoming more uh just understanding the [[metacrisis]] a little bit more and and it's kind of like the resource that can back future reports or future thinking that um that that that uh that is with respect to the [[metacrisis]] so it feels like you're you're kind of like building institutions under you or like resources under you that can help enable understanding of the [[metacrisis]] and that'll enable other people to address it is is that directionally how you think about it you know we talked in the first session about what are some of the things that are [[generator function|generator functions]] or underlying drivers of most of the issues and we talked about things like [[perverse incentive]] that whether you're talking about [[climate change]] or [[species extinction]] or overfishing or um corruption of political parties [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] are underneath that so any work that can do a deeper job of being able to identify or the incentive [830](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=830.399s)

of any company country department individual uh if is uh at odds with the well-being of others and the well-being of the commons and particularly where people are an important representative positions and things like that you can make improvements so there's all the vertical areas but then there's things that kind [849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=849.0s)

of cut across them and reverse incentive was an example externalities and decision-making processes are an example there's something inherent to the nature of the complexity of the world and the way we try to narrow it right as soon as we moved to kind of beyond dunbar little villages the little tribes division of labor specialization it was [871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=871.56s)

a huge part of how lots of beneficial things came about in coordination but you also end up getting a situation where uh because i'm not focused on the whole i'm focused on a part i'm just making this kind of widget or i'm working in this domain i can identify the metrics of success for that domain optimize them my incentive and institutional mandate is to do that but [896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=896.16s)

it affects other things and it can have harmful effects other places and so you can have places where the solution to one problem is making other problems worse and vice versa and then because some people know that they push back on it and um and so inherent to trying to narrow the [[problem space]] is one of the drivers of the [[metacrisis]] and yet somebody can't think about everything and work about on everything all the time and so there's a way to have kind of [[metacrisis]] or holistically informed considerations while still focusing on a part right you're i'm working on something that is not everything but i am cognizant of the fact that affects everything and my goal is not just how do i make this cool tech [938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=938.639s)

that solves this problem but how do i do that in a way with the totality of the effects or as omnipositive as possible and not other things so in this particular you know thing that um you and i are engaging in here and inviting people into the idea that people can work on research and development of addressing questions of how [[web3]] tech can cause problems that we want to think through how to prevent and how it can help solve problems that we want to help advance holistically across all the fields it's still not saying also then be thinking about that for ai and nuclear incense bio it's still partitioning into a subset of everything but a subset that is more informed by [984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=984.36s)

how it interacts with everything else and so i would say yeah in general trying to take groups and institutions that are focused on things and uh help them do it in ways that are more cognizant of what is outside of the space of their traditional consideration to improve the consideration set is definitely something that um i'm trying to do [1008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1008.24s)

and i guess one other thing i'll say here is most of the time with new technology somebody develops and figures out new technology it can be funded by government or by non-profit research institutes or by the market but the market funds a lot of it and even if a university or whatever figured out the underlying tech the market usually [1034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1034.16s)

figures out how to implement it at scale and then it benefits something and it harms some other things like putting lead in gasoline or ddt or whatever and the regulatory processes to say oh you can't actually use that tech in that way you got to get the lead out of the gasoline got us off the ddt typically follow after the harm has happened by many decades [1055](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1055.82s)

and so they don't get a fix all the harm that's happened they just are supposed to try to stop it when you're dealing with leaded gasoline going in the air the you can do that but you can't fix the fact that having lowered the world's iq by a billion points through the effects of that gasoline going the lead going into [[nervous system|nervous systems]] made an indefinite number of really  __  terrible choices that continue to affect the world forever and but as the speed of tech increases if you do the same thing with synthetic bio or the thing that you put out is reproducing and if you try to regulate it later you can just never get it back right or it's just operating way the  __  faster the world breaks you have to [1097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1097.76s)

actually do a better job of thinking about the negative externalities and engaging the regulatory landscape ahead of time a lot of people here might be bothered by this because they're like  __  regulation governments are corrupt so okay that's but that's not an answer right the answer has to be how does how do we solve ensuring that people don't [1115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1115.52s)

have a motive to do something that benefits something at some short time frame but harms lots of stuff over some long time scale how do we figure out how to do a better job with that what's so interesting every rare once in a while there's an opportunity where a developing space does regulation first like there's been this international treaty that nobody's [1136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1136.64s)

allowed to mine antarctica or mine the seabed and now that resource pressures are kind of probably going to force that to happen before it's allowed to happen there has to be this international regulatory process to say how could that happen environmentally friendly way it's actually very interesting it seems like a pain in the ass from a market capitalism point of view but if you [1154](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1154.46s)

really think of it from an [[existential risk]] point you're like well of course that's necessary so with um crypto and with [[web3]] if the com if we're thinking about okay what are all the things that we think are cool that if they really succeeded could suck and or be not that important compared to the other things [1172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1172.64s)

we do a landscape analysis of how the tech should develop versus how it's likely to develop right now what that delta is and how do we close it being able to think through that up front and then say through education through culture building of what is cool through formal legal regulation through investment groups that only invest in things that meet these criteria and not [1192](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1192.5s)

others like through the whole suite of capacities how do we help steer that i think that's a  __  amazing opportunity and that's what kind of i'm excited about here is to be able to think through the steering of a fundamentally powerful technological domain more consecutive yeah i mean i think it's an amazing opportunity to sort of grasp the whole [1215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1215.36s)

elephant you know there's this whole idea that um you know blind men grasping an elephant whoever grasps the trunk will think that it's uh that it's a hose whoever grasp the tail will think that it's a rope whoever grasps the testicle think it's a sphere but none of them is truly grasping the whole elephant in the [[metacrisis]] is kind of like this uh this thing where you have to grasp all of the different dependencies because um you know if you tug the rope and then the elephant goes running then you  __  over everyone else um and so that's why i think that what's really inspiring about you daniel is not only can you address the problem but you're also sort of galvanizing these resources in order to also grasp the [1252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1252.44s)

whole elephant and then start to address um well hopefully we'll see uh address the [[metacrisis]] so um at this point that i think that uh i will name drop metacrisdao.com which is a resource that i am launching which will be uh it's not it's it's not not a doubt in the sense that there's no token or anything like that it's just a discourse forum where people are [1276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1276.919s)

interested in your work that are web 3 native can come and try to grasp the whole elephant we can start to think about uh the [[metacrisis]] in a systemic way a holistic way and we're kind of working forwards from what is the [[metacrisis]] what are some criteria for evolving the [[metacrisis]] and then backwards from our knowledge of what three towards uh how could web 3 and [1299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1299.0s)

crypto being used to solve the [[metacrisis]] and i think those sort of like the a priori theory i think is that the [[metacrisis]] is all about um avoiding catastrophes uh which is basically like [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] and then dystopias which are authoritarian governments that are sort of reacting to [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] and this uh this idea of a [[third attractor]] which is finding a way that is not centralized in order to address the [[coordination failure]] and for me it feels like it like a priori [[web3]] is decentralized coordination so we should be able to find some ways uh that [[web3]] may eventually will move away from doing uh monkey jpegs and pump and dump schemes and solve actual systemic global [[coordination failure|coordination failures]] like the [[metacrisis]] and so anyway metacritis style is going to be a discourse forum and the telegram channel in which we all kind of start to try to support your work as much as possible daniel but uh hopefully eventually get to building web 3 solutions that that address the [[metacrisis]] so uh for the listener out there who's interested in getting involved [[metacrisis]] dow.com is going to be where we are going to be coordinating and it's just going to be a forum post and telegram channel and maybe eventually weekly or monthly community calls from there so how could how can this community support you daniel is is the question yeah i mean i i'm super stoked that um you're setting that up and i'm excited for the people that will come [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1389.48s)

and i am grateful for the way you framed it uh i would frame it a little differently as it's actually not about i don't really need people to support me it's they're the people who are interested in [[public good|public goods]] and regenerative crypto already interested in the same stuff i'm interested in and it's more like the [1408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1408.08s)

frameworks of thinking about these things that we've developed to be helpful to think through the things that the people in the space are already innately interested in how to do that better so uh you know [[public good|public goods]] interest in the space has to do with the recognition that commons management's a big deal and that when we're talking about the oceans [1430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1430.22s)

or we're talking about the um totality of pollinators or biodiversity or atmosphere we need to to be able to do a fundamentally better job of global commons management than we currently do are there like how do we do that are there ways that the uh affordances of the new technology make that more possible that we can um get the off-chain world on chain adequately to be able to do things like actually track externalities and make it to where the cost of an externality has to be internalized into the equation where the entirety of the market stops being perverse um and that's pretty humongous where you actually get to track decision-making provenance in ways that will make [1475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1475.7s)

corruption much harder um i think these are some of the most important kinds of things somebody could be working on i think understanding some of the [[problem space]] just a little deeper to be able to really think through adequate solutions is really valuable so i i know you're already engaged in this but i would love if kind of following this the other people that understand the kind of [[metacrisis]] frame and understand [[web3]] better than i do could come and speak to some of their specific thoughts on this like i think it'd be great to have matan and primavera and glenn weil and jordan hall and arthur brock and you know all those folks [1514](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1514.58s)

um because they've got a lot of very specific thoughts mahala on um specifically how to how to do some of those things i will say that it would be silly for us to not acknowledge that one of the biggest possibilities that the space may ever face it's going to be facing right now and it's huge which is technologies emerge in relationship to [1545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1545.2s)

other technologies right like i can't without breakthroughs in metallurgy and manufacturing i don't get breakthroughs in the weapons that require those [[tool making]] tools and vice versa right without breakthroughs in gpus i don't get the comparable breakthroughs in ai and so we have to be looking at web 3 in light of the rest of the tool stack in addition to the culture stack financial stack et cetera that the world is looking at and so at the time of this recording uh chat gpt and mid-journey and the kind of totality of generator tech being available to the public is you know not only one of the most interesting stories in the world right now but one of the most interesting [1595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1595.76s)

inflection points in the entire history of humanity uh uh because when we think about technological revolutions we think about how much the world changed when we figured out how to extract oil this is pretty  __  big deal figuring out how to increase the energetic process that our body does outside of [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1618.919s)

our body um that powerfully and so we went from half a billion people to 8 billion people really fast and we increased the total amount of calories per person consumed by 100x that's huge of course some of the externality is that we've just destroying the planet's ability to continue to maintain us um so there's a bunch of technological epochs that have been big where they're taking some human capacity and kind of externalizing it ai is obviously taking the technology creation capacity that is novel to humans itself and externalizing it and putting it on a exponential self-recursion loop which is why it's such a unique  __  [1660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1660.62s)

thing it's why singularity is near and you know the focus on agi take off is such a big thing um and i anticipate that this you know the the very limited capacities that gpt3 going public has um shown uh will be shown up by gpt4 like whether through open ai or other [1688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1688.279s)

leading companies in the space will be improved upon in the next month and couple months with public releases of technology that already exists so much so that it will change fundamental things about the world radically forever um very specifically i think turing test passing content generation where humans really cannot tell if it was produced by machines or humans [1715](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1715.279s)

across most categories and the speed at which that content can be produced is such a humongously world-changing thing um and so how do you up obviously the ability to make recursive relationships of those ais you already [1738](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1738.679s)

have the facebook ai that curates existing content based on personalized data of the person to maximize behavioral metrics now that you can have content creation ais that are not just taking the existing content humans are making but bespoke content based on personal harvested data about the person and then curation ais and the intersection of those and you start to [1758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1758.72s)

think about what type of propaganda and cult generation machine taking the humans aren't rational actors because of behavioral econ and just pushing that to the  __  asymptote of how much we can make that not the case polarization um doubling down on bias [[hypernormal stimuli [1778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1778.76s)

]] there is another direction it could go right you could use it to do the opposite which is personalized education and development to help people see other points of view and they become more more rational actors and etc there's way the  __  less incentive currently to do that direction than the other one now is there a way that the relationship [1796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1796.539s)

between web 3 tech and ai is particularly interesting yeah right if you start having this deep fake um ubiquitous deep fake thing does tech like [[music]] um rigorous identity um start to become one of the most important things i think that's a [1823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1823.82s)

probably uh very likely development right do i know at least is this a human or a bot that is developing it um things on the provenance of info that goes into something kind of info provenance tech i think become hugely important um so i think this is an area that deserves a tremendous amount of [1847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1847.58s)

attention um and i think we'll probably get a tremendous amount of attention i wouldn't want it to suck up all the attention in a reactive way because how do we identify all of the externalities of like environmental externalities let's say we take the paper [1867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1867.799s)

that was published since last time we talked on uh pfos levels fluorinated surfactant levels crossing [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] globally published a couple months ago that showed that rainwater all around the world even if you go off-grid in the middle of montana or canada or whatever your rainwater still has beyond epa levels of fluorinated surfactants that are carcinogens [1889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1889.82s)

whatever this is like i can't begin to describe what a humongous  __  thing this is so can we have sensors can we have iot sensors etc that are monitoring where that  __  is coming from and where it is going and actually creating both legal accountability and enforcement of like financial externalization of those costs [1911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1911.96s)

same with nitrogen affluent and phosphorus affluent that's causing [[dead zone|dead zones]] this work guys like uh greg landua from regen network you know are looking at can we use some of these crypto tools to help the proliferation of soil regenerative technologies rather than soil depleting technologies i think all of these applications are so [1933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1933.679s)

profoundly interesting and fascinating and frightly developed i think the ai one is going to get going to get and deserves to get a huge amount of attention right away because i think it fundamentally portends changes about the nature of um [[open society]] itself and all paparian ideas and all rational actor theory and all representative democracy [1954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1954.98s)

um so i think that would be a really good kind of clarion call of coalescing the space to deal with that thing but then wanting to simultaneously generate what is the whole problem set because if you can use you can also use crypto as one of the tools to be able to bind ai it for it's more positive and less harmful applications the combination of those [1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=1978.86s)

things along with the nature of the [[social tech]] is capable of being used in problem solving technologies across all the areas yeah i mean i think there's an amazing opportunity to take all this a really incredible technology that's creating existential capacity and use it for the [[public good]] i mean that's my greatest hope for what crypto can accomplish um so i know that we've we've opened up the aperture of a lot of possibility here uh for me the the thing that is keep back coming back to is go to metacrisisdial.com uh sign up to get the updates and we'll just be having discussions there uh we'll be doing uh possibly at some point weekly in monthly community calls we'll see what form [2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2023.26s)

things want to take and then i think that there will be work work groups i i call them think feel groups because we're not paying anyone so they're they're think field groups about different aspects of this and um you know one of the things that i'm really excited about is that uh through my work and through the podcasts that we've done uh you've already already gotten to know [2042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2042.6s)

some people in the web 3 space who are uh like for example we talked about steven reed and the and the map of your work that he did um and so this is an opportunity for people to get on your radar who are doing really good work in the space and i think that um the thing that i can do is just set a [[schelling point]] for for people to come and get involved and start using this tech for for good so [[metacrisis]].l.com is is where it's at um you know i'm curious what else you want to say before we wrap this episode this was going to be a shorter episode just a bridge episode together people people an update on on um what we've been up to uh i i'm curious what the rest of 2023 looks like [2081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2081.639s)

for you daniel and and how what you're up to is going to ebb and flow with uh the questions that we're asking um at metacris dow yeah so the questions that i would love to see really well populated debated thought through um i would like to [2107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2107.619s)

see and kind of learn from uh first one is thinking about the entire field of [[web3]] technologies it would be good to even just kind of make a short taxonomy of what that means what are all the types of technologies and kind of primary applications that are being thought of but in that space what are all of the [2134](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2134.02s)

um possible negative externalities both physically and psychosocial that this space could either accelerate or exacerbate or novelty create i would like to see some just deep workshopping on that where you just read team the  __  out of the idea of the positiveness of the crypto itself um and say okay well let's say we make [2156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2156.4s)

uncorruptable ledgers for the provenance of information and science or whatever so that we people aren't going to be messing with the data and so we can do better open data open science stuff that seems really good where is that not good well let's say we have a situation like we happen to have in the world today where you've got people doing [2182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2182.44s)

viral hunting and then gain a function research on pathogens to make way more uh potentially dangerous very little and pathological pathogens hopefully in the name of how to develop anticipatory responses vaccines medicines whatever it is um but then publish those gene sequences which may be before [2207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2207.099s)

um cheap gene sequencers might have been a good idea but then say the technological landscape changes like it has and you have cheap gene sequencers and getting cheaper to where we're only a few years out on the current trajectory if it doesn't change which hopefully will of the ability to take the information about a genome and actually make it being really quite [2230](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2230.32s)

cheap and very decentralized and not something that only state actors um have and that even if you tried to regulate who are the companies that can make the gene printers you could diy you know yourself all right well now if that new technology emerges i want to be able to get those  __  gene sequencies up offline [2250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2250.359s)

well if can i do that if i just made a situation where it's impossible to do that well now we need to say like okay is there some way to have an uncorruptable ledger but that um can have access protocols and various levels of access protocol obviously if we're trying to deal with government stuff there is  __  that shouldn't be totally publicly available because it [2273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2273.7s)

involves [[national security]] stuff that um saying where the most vulnerable infrastructure targets are out in the public is stupid and yet you also don't want no provenance on information so how do you think through those things um so i think if one starts to just really think through what are the technologies that and people have already been thinking through if you try to make a trustless system are you actually making a system that will have cultural effects of less trust um and you know do you on and on i think a population of all of the positive i mean all the possible negative applications of the tech including not [2321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2321.7s)

just the obvious thing but second third order type things i think that would be extraordinarily useful not to discourage the space as a whole it's you know if you look at what bostrom did with super intelligence and kind of populating what are all the places where super intelligence could go wrong i think the web 3 version of that would be a good idea right [2343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2343.0s)

um what are the places that could go wrong to really think about how to avoid that and how to steer that that's the first thing i'd really like to see and the other thing because if you then focus on the next part which is the problems that can solve the opportunities and you haven't done that other one you might be wrong or yes it might solve that thing but make some [2359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2359.859s)

other worship in the process you want to make sure you're not doing that so that's why i'm making the order of operations the next step i would really like to see people engaging in and generating ideas on is both by vertical topic area like let's by topic area you could say [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] and [[exponential tech]] x risk or you can make it much narrower and just say dealing with weaponized drones and dealing with grid fragility and dealing with fragility of the amazon coral etc for each of those types of issues uh does web 3 tech by itself or in conjunction with other technologies laws projects enable solutions that are not currently existent i think really trying to populate that how could it be not by [2406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2406.96s)

itself how could it be part of a suite of endeavors that enable new solutions i think that's an extraordinarily rich useful process and i think in [[web3]] folks engaging with topic matter experts in major global risk areas and global problem areas not just even global risk even like sdgs and saying what are the hardest problems that you can't fix what [2432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2432.16s)

makes them wicked and really trying to see is there anything about the affordances of this technology that could help solve that that would be just amazing to populate and to kind of taxonomize and that's kind of the vertical divisions the deeper horizontal divisions are things like the [[generator function|generator functions]] how could we address [[perverse incentive]] writ large or in different contexts how could we address commoning writ large how could we address internalizing externalities in the decision-making processes writ large how could we address turning a theory of trade-offs into synergistic satisfiers being able to think through those deep things which is where if someone doesn't have enough of the [[metacrisis]] context there it's worth getting it and that's why the thing steven reed started to put together where he put took all those podcasts and made it to where you can just go straight to the point in the video where the things are talked about because videos hard to search um that's a really cool tool right now until we have better resources but to [2488](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2488.2s)

start to think through what are the solutions there and then again red team your own solutions in the space but you'll start to find like in the x in the externality part you might be like god damn some of the things we're working on are actually terrible now that we think through it better and should really not happen the way they are that would be great and [2504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2504.16s)

then simultaneously there's like there's actually a couple areas where we could develop things that are profoundly awesome and we should really focus the entire community's efforts on this and really work to get groups focused on capital investment focused there et cetera plus two things i'll say in the section is so that's what i'd love to see people [2523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2523.42s)

working on and insofar as contribution really starts to happen there then i look forward to learn about it and comment on it um you're mentioning that it's you know there's not kind of paid work it's more contribution that people are interested in i do think being able to have a small number of people who are full-time focused on that research and being able [2548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2548.74s)

to find the research that has already been done and some of the good work that's been done in various places obviously metallic and charles and lots of groups have worked on some of these things and try to synthesize it and taxonomize it would speed it up a lot and who can even host the uh the convening and so i think if anyone listening to this likes the general direction and wants to donate small amounts to a couple people being able to do that that kevin could help manage that would be a thing i would be really stoked on so say that and um yeah amazing well uh [2589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2589.78s)

uh listeners can't can't hear it but if you're watching the video you may see it i'm furiously typing and ticking notes and there will be a post on [[metacrisis]] style with uh the five prompts that you just gave us right there daniel so curious to see what the web 3 community brings back but the fact that you've already discovered people like steven reed i think [2610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2610.0s)

is is hopefully a sign that there's that there's something here amazing and i mentioned a few names of people that i think would be really valuable to get on there's obviously a lot more people um i think having audrey tang on and a deep discussion of what [[web3]] tech and other tech what is the [2632](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2632.02s)

what is the whole suite of both tech and like social and government activities that would need to happen to advance better digital governance system in relationship to state governments and where could people actually really start to make progress with that that would be amazing right i think that'd be super valuable um and uh also wanted to say there's a somebody that works with me named chris eddie who i know is engaging in the calls that you guys are doing to make sure that um you know some of the [[metacrisis]] analytics are available and people are talking about them so i'm happy about that and uh yeah i look forward to see i look forward to see what comes [2673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2673.18s)

amazing well daniel i think that this is not the third episode that we were planning to make when we started this series but um i'm i'm very happy to be continuing to build a channel between the [[web3]] community and your work um and i'm just so thankful to you for continuing to spend time here i think that a lot of the world we're recording [2692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2692.5s)

this at the end of january and 2023 a lot of the world has moved on from [[web3]] into ai um and the fact that you still see promise here um i just appreciate your conviction that the web 3 community is is going to be able to contribute here and and i think that we will so um thanks for taking the time and i hope [2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2710.2s)

that we prove you right should get some of the folks from radical exchange on whether clan or matt or because the relationship between um what ai does and what [[web3]] can do that is critical in relationship with it is something that they are working on have a lot of academics contributing to they think would be really really valuable [2731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2731.5s)

um yeah obviously where all the attention is has a lot to do with the economic opportunities and there was a  __  economic opportunities in some way associated with crypto and i think you know there's ais there but the [[problem space]] that was interesting is it's still there the same kind of [[problem space]] and the opportunity space and so everybody who is still actively focused on it hopefully is because they're they're actually independent of a bubble really interested in what can be built it is meaningful there so yeah yeah well i i hope that uh by the time the next market cycle and the attention that comes back on crypto associated with that arrives that uh [2774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2774.099s)

we'll have something more interesting to play with than just toy nfts and um and that [[web3]] can actually have some meaningful examples of things that fund the commons and [[public good|public goods]] and address them in a crisis so that is a hope and uh that is what i'll maybe end the episode on as a as an aspiration anything i didn't ask that you want to [2793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2793.66s)

say daniel no i'm just uh i i really love what you have done with getting all the people that are interested in the actual interesting applications in an entire space to be uh collaborative together and that's why i'm so i am here talking with you and i'm stoked to see what comes next so thank [2817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2817.359s)

you man yeah well it's all about coordination and um you know you mentioned audrey tang and she has this quote about um about how her her role is not to be a minister for a certain group but to be a channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together so i think that that's an aspiration that we have with the [2834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv_xBK_XZjw&t=2834.4s)

greenfield podcast hopefully [[metacrisis]] dao will become that and um yeah so if you're listening then open up metacrisistow.com on your on your phone or on your device and uh sign up and and let's get this party started and then hopefully in six more months we'll have something to talk about when we do episode four together awesome thanks again daniel [[music]]
