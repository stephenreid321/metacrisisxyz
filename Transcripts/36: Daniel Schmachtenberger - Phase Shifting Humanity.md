hey guys welcome to episode number 36 of the future thinkers podcast today our guest is daniels martin berger daniel is an evolutionary philosopher strategist and social engineer his work focuses on [[complex system|complex systems]] the evolution of humanity and global resource allocation his goal is to find the shortest path to a fundamentally redesigned [[world system]] that supports in an ongoing way the highest quality of life for everybody on [21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=21.029s)

the planet he specifically focuses on developing economic and governmental systems that by design incentivize life enhancing behavior daniels recent project is neuro hacker collective which is a smart drug brand with a vision of holistic human optimization in this episode daniel talks about many deep and fascinating ideas to do with building a better future for all of humanity he [43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=43.29s)

specifically talks about the different systems we will need to transition into this new world and to mitigate [[existential risk|existential risks]] this is a really great episode i think it's one of our favorites if you want all the shownotes books and mentions from this episode go to future thinkers org slash 36 before we get into it as always i want to thank our recent patrons and donors diana [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=64.53s)

pascal rich and nigel thank you guys for making this show happen you're awesome all right here's the show welcome to future thinkers org a podcast about the evolution and technology society and consciousness i'm mai gilliland and i'm uv ivanova this episode is brought to you by eternity the oracle machine eternity is a new [[blockchain]] platform for smart contracts with a token crowd sale launching in march 2017 go to future thinkers org slash eternity and subscribe to their mailing list to get notified when it goes live to get notified of new podcasts and videos go to future thinkers org and subscribe to our mailing list you can also find us on itunes stitcher and you tube if you like what we do and you want to help us make more podcasts and videos give us a like or review share it with your friends and consider becoming a patron go to patreon.com/crashcourse slash bap daniel welcome to the show thank you so much for joining us so we're gonna have a lot of things to talk about today but why don't we start by talking about an optimistic future of humanity and what we need to do to transition into that future there are a lot of visions and [140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=140.38s)

theories out there about the ultimate macro system that we need to adopt not only to survive the century but to thrive what is your vision of that first i wouldn't talk in terms of an ultimate system talk in terms of ongoing evolution and so rather than kind of a utopian as one has previously thought of a perfected system we're going to think of a proto pian process right a process [163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=163.09s)

of emergence into more elegantly ordered complexity that has more and more [[emergent property|emergent properties]] and more of the things we're interested in and gets over some of the underlying causes of things we want to get past i would say that rather than just iterative evolution we are on the brink of a phase shift and phase shift defined by core axioms and core foundations of most of our macro [189](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=189.13s)

global systems from our worldview to our economics to our governance to our infrastructure going through foundational shifts so this looks like a step function in evolution where we have had capitalism that has gone through kind of iterative developmental processes and we've had representative democracy that's gone through iterative developmental processes and you know [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=212.44s)

scientific methodology and worldview and etc now we are on the brink of something that requires larger more fundamental axiomatic and structural shift and so we can talk about what the criteria for the other side of that have to look like for it to be a non-[[self-terminating]] system and for it to be a anti fragile system and those are two of the important criteria of any kind of world that is [240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=240.73s)

interesting for anyone right it is definitely non-[[self-terminating]] and then not anti fragile then there's more things we'll talk about on top of that so you want to talk about what those criteria must be well sure but first let's define the problem so what's wrong with our current system and why do we to transition out of it so when we say [260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=260.739s)

our current system we are sweeping a lot of things together and it's worth kind of pulling those apart a bit we might be talking about macroeconomics which obviously the macroeconomics of china and the macroeconomics of russia the macroeconomics of the united states if nato are different systems but there are kind of beyond national global [[economic system|economic systems]] that we can we can look at we can look at governance systems again national and then transnational governance and then beyond anything that's codified how human decision-making works right we can think of governance in the highest sense of how do we do collective decision-making at various scales from a business to a family to a nation to groups of nations to a species as a whole navigating [305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=305.74s)

things that face the whole species economics we can think about how do we do resource allocation and how do we do human incentive systems with infrastructure we can talk about how do we meet our physical needs and relationship with the physical planet right education medicines we have a lot of different systems that co evolved and they are interconnected and entering and [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=327.34s)

then you can think of a you know kind of evolving paradigm that involves all of those things but we're gonna need to talk about at least the core ones in distinction from each other so what is the problem we're trying to fix well one thing is those current systems the interface of those current systems with each other and the net effects are unsustainable and unsustainable means [353](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=353.639s)

[[self-terminating]] means that these systems run to their own end and then fall off some kind of cliff right and so when we look at growth curves of different kinds of organisms anytime we see a growth curve that has an exponential up that is not forever and sometimes the exponential up goes logistic and that's very nice sometimes it drops off pretty hard before it [378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=378.159s)

logistics sometimes it goes through a lot of unstability you sometimes just exponential's up and then drops off a cliff right so we were under half a billion popularly for all of human history as far as we know 200 plus thousand years until the [[industrial revolution]] and then in just over 200 years we went up to over 7 billion people and growing and that is a [406](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=406.39s)

profound exponential population curve not only have we went through this profound exponential population curve in relationship to our ability to extract resources from the planet that are not replenishing themselves which is what the [[industrial revolution]] was right mining farming fishing logging etc the ability to take some kind of resource reserves that took hundreds of millions [430](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=430.21s)

or billions of years to develop and to be able to extract them at a radically fast pace and obviously much faster than they can renew and then the population is growing on that savings account until you hit the end of a savings account and then there's real problems not only have we been growing in population but we've been growing in resource consumption per capita so this is a multiplicative issue [454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=454.27s)

that we are getting near the end of the viability of that particular part of right when we think about running an economy it requires a year-over-year growth requires it because your fractional izing the monetary supply even deeper than that just interest where the monetary supply has to fundamentally expand right then to not debase the currency you have to increase [479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=479.71s)

the total amount of goods and services services sit on top of product economies which relate to a linear [[materials economy]] product [[materials economy]] which the linear [[materials economy]] means extracting resources from the planet unruhe notably which means devastation of ecosystems and things like that and then turning them into trash in ways that usually consume a good bit of [503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=503.05s)

energy from dirty sources create a lot of pollution and externalize harm to people environments along the way you know and then end with waste so that kind of [[exponential growth]] economy and attach to a linear [[materials economy]] just doesn't work ongoing leon my planet right it only would work ongoingly on an infinite playing field which were not on and so that is a [524](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=524.57s)

fundamentally [[self-terminating]] system it makes plenty of sense that when there was just so much low-hanging fruit in terms of coal and oil and fish and trees and etc that we would do this exponential boom kind of thing it's just that's not viable anymore it also happens to be that the technologies that would allow us to be really viable in a post growth [[economic system]] it's not about net more consumption but about using the same things in a closed-loop [[materials economy]] in ever more interesting ways so a [[materials economy]] that is closed-loop post growth and upcycling continuously upcycling the technology it takes to do that is technology we are just now getting happens to be that that's at the same time that we are just now getting [572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=572.45s)

to the point of self-determination of the old system right so we both have to shift and can at the same time the technologies it takes to build this kind of sustainable regenerative thriving new set of [[world system|world systems]] is technology that we developed via capitalism and linear [[materials economy]] and the military industrial complex and all those things so they served in evolutionary relevance [600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=600.05s)

in terms of where we're going and they have just completed a particular evolutionary relevant lifecycle now we're going through a discrete phase shift into a new life cycle very much like a fetal time period right in the embryonic time period is unsustainable the caterpillar can't just keep devastating its ecosystem without pollinating forever but that's not how [621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=621.11s)

it works and the baby couldn't stay in the belly after 40 weeks and parasitically but that's not how it works it is going through a period where its system is fundamentally not capable of the kinds of autonomy that it will later be capable of so it's a finite evolutionary period of unsustainable development to then go through a [642](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=642.26s)

discrete phase shift to then be in a fundamentally new period and so i think it's a very fair analogy to look at humanity as having been the kind of embryonic period bucky fuller used to like to speak to it like that like a you know chicken embryo having finished eating the egg white on renewable resources emerge from a world it didn't know it was in right emerge [664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=664.13s)

from the shell into a world where that it now has a beak to eat that it didn't have before when i was eating the egg whites come from plants that it's poop fertilizes and it's part of this larger kind of regenerative process they evolved so when we talk about what the problem is our [[materials economy]] is unsustainable our macroeconomic structures themselves or ideas of [685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=685.18s)

ownership and valuation and etc are all fundamentally unsustainable they're coming up on the cliffs of unsustainability are exponentially increasing tech curves are creating more and more [[existential threat|existential threats]] etc right so this is all what we would call [[self-terminating]] and even before we get into existential and [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] it's also already causing suffering at just [711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=711.23s)

such massive scales whether we're talking about you know war and drum strikes on civilians or whether we're talking about [[factory farm|factory farms]] that are these just rolling apocalypses or whether we're talking about fishing the oceans down to nearly nothing or with we can forecast future catastrophic scenarios but we're in them right we're in these rolling [730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=730.91s)

catastrophes moving towards complete unviable 'ti and so the future systems were interested in have to prevent total [[existential risk]] and total [[catastrophic risk]] they have to solve the foundational causes of the current unnecessary human induced suffering and then create [[world system|world systems]] that make possible and probable and induce higher quality of life across all the very meaningful quality of life [761](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=761.57s)

metrics for all life and optimize evolutionary rate it seems like most people are saying capitalism is what's gotten us here and you're just taking a couple extra steps to see where it results you know a plus b equals c or when we proposed basic income in the past that's usually their answer well capitalism has got us this far why would it not take us further you think about [783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=783.35s)

that embryo that baby growing in the mother's belly and if you didn't know that it was a baby that was going to birth at a certain point it would be easy to mistake it as a very serious parasite yes because it's it is taking a lot of nutritional load from her body right it is modifying her physiology profoundly and if you imagine a mom in the eight to [806](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=806.31s)

nine months if you didn't know that there was a discrete phase shift about to happen you'd be pretty sure she was very near dying in a pretty terrible way this is the difference between a parasite and a baby is that the baby goes to that for a finite period and then phase shifts into a different phase right interestingly when we look at parasitology biology vector ology there [829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=829.8s)

are many parasites that when they initially start feeding on an animal human whatever and they haven't before they kill them fairly quickly the ones that were aggressive enough to kill the hosts quickly don't propagate right because they killed their host they don't live very long they don't get to travel on to many other hosts the milder versions that don't actually kill their [849](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=849.82s)

hosts get to both live longer and propagate more and so there are a number of pathogens that get less toxic over an evolutionary time frame because they have to be we don't get the chance of killing lots of planets to figure out you know we could do it that way that only the planets where the people were less problematic in this way and that making it through but we want to do a [870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=870.07s)

more conscious version than that right and so rather than the slow evolution of a parasite to be less pathologic we need to do the actually going through a birth into a new phase model and we can what's so fascinating is that if we define a civilization where we have a sustainable population that does not require imposition from the outside some kind of eugenics program or chinese births [897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=897.88s)

limiting program whatever it is a emergent self-organizing phenomena and we've already seen plenty of places in the world where when education gets high enough economics and female empowerment and etc that population stabilizes can even decrease to find the right levels of where it's at we've seen japan we've seen it in some of the scandinavian countries and so to have a [919](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=919.329s)

steady-state population that is within the sustainable carrying capacity of the planet connected to a post growth [[materials economy]] where the materials that we are using are being designed in a cradle-to-cradle way where they're recyclable 'ti after this particular use is built right in there's no such thing as waste there's just moving the old stuff back into new stuff the new stuff [946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=946.329s)

is being made from old stuff so it doesn't require virgin resource acquisition the only new thing coming into the system and doesn't mean we won't ever take a new thing into the system as far as atoms go we could we find an asteroid with some interesting platinum we could do that or but we have a system that doesn't require trash or extraction right that's what post growth [965](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=965.35s)

means is post necessity for growth so that it actually can be sustainable viable and then we just keep increasing the efficiency of how we utilize those resources and attenuating the forms that they're in the only resource that we keep bringing into the system continuously is energy because that's what we keep having ongoing access to so we have new photons coming in all the [986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=986.56s)

time we don't have new atoms coming in all the time these new photons coming in all the time allows us to keep recycling the atoms where we're upcycling them rather than downcycling them because this is not a closed system right we get to externalize entropy out of the system bring you know enough energy to keep driving more central people in the system so when we ask what are the [1005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1005.55s)

necessary and sufficient criteria of a sustainable non [[self-terminating]] thriving anti fragile world that does obsolete the catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] the current cause of suffering and create higher qualities of life we could actually do this construction in detail sometime but i'll just kind of state the things as far as infrastructure goes our physical [1027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1027.66s)

relationship with the physical world it does require these three criteria closed-loop post growth and upcycling right negative entropy but it's not actually negative into pre no thermodynamics sense because we're bringing energy into the system as far as [[social system|social systems]] go economics governance law language right the social [1048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1048.329s)

agreement fields by which we navigate collective agreement collective decision-making collective resource allocation all the things beyond just individual action we can think of governance as how we make decisions that involve co decision-making collaborative decision-making most all of the decisions we're going to make are going to involve allocating resources of some [1070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1070.03s)

kind some way so we think of economics as how we allocate resources and the other major thing that economics has done is human incentives so when there's a bunch of shitty jobs that nobody if they didn't have to would want to spend all of their life doing maybe i'll pave a road a little bit now and again but i don't want to spend 40 hours a week my entire life until retirement doing that [1092](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1092.32s)

as long as we have shitty jobs especially in the labor economy that the society needs done for the quality of life that is related to infrastructure then we need to get the people to do the jobs adam smith talked about this marx did everybody did right it's the core of economic theory so if you do some kind of communism where everyone's needs are met by the system then how do you get [1115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1115.84s)

the people to do their shitty jobs well then the state has to force them and we call that imperialism is why we don't like communism right or everyone has to do an equal amount but that's still the who is gonna enforce that state that's important so capitalism says no no we'll let the free market enforce them right which is if they don't do the shitty jobs they just go homeless that's really [1133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1133.63s)

not freedom still it just moved the forcing function from the state to market right well as we're moving into technological automation this foundational axiom of all economic theories which is how do we deal with the labor economy right is the this is an axiomatic topic is being obsoleted we're up sleeting that all of the conversations that marx and smith [1158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1158.98s)

and friends had and so that both solves problems and it brings new ones so when we have technological automation that is capable of automating the shitty jobs and it's important to get when i say that that doesn't mean that the machines are going to take your jobs and you can't garden if you want to in garden or washer toilet if you want to you just don't have to wash [1182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1182.549s)

your toilet all the time because we can make bathrooms that clean themselves better right and then if you just want to do that you're welcome to human freedom can absolutely do that if you want a garden you're welcome to do that but can we create vertical agriculture systems that automate many aspects of that while providing high-quality nutritious food with lower impact on the [1200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1200.82s)

environment yes we can right and that opens up more human freedom not that's the other so as long as we have a situation where the jobs need the people then we have to make it where the people also need the jobs ie capitalism right which is why that system has you know succeeded in a darwinian sense in the way that it has it's important to get that darwinian selection does not select [1222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1222.75s)

for the true the good and the beautiful right it selects for what is adaptive which means what is dominant within scarcity dynamics now even if that's gonna you know be going extinct in the very near future because it's not forecasting it's not adequately forecasting right as soon as you can make it to where the jobs don't need the people the automation you can also make [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1246.45s)

it where the people don't need the jobs which is what the commonwealth economics is moving towards in a first step in the direction is the basic income basic income is not enough but it is a step and the key for it not to be a welfare system when we think about the problems of the welfare system and how you have people who don't have the darwinian motive to create that capitalism gave [1269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1269.76s)

them so they just sit on the couch and smoke crack all day those are people that have already been broken this is a very important point when you look at little children they're asking questions all day long why is fire hot why is the sky blue where do we go after we die where do you know they're fascinated asking deep philosophic and physics and you know etc [1288](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1288.63s)

questions and they want to help do stuff and they want to build stuff and they and then we don't answer those questions because why the is fire hot that's actually a very deep physics question and then it's moving from physics to consciousness studies let the mind brain interface of [[subjective experience]] of hotness with on the skin and nerve pathways and so we [1307](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1307.2s)

say i don't know spell cat and we don't facilitate their interests while forcing them to be interested in completely uninteresting and thereby breaking their interest in life so then they just want to veg the out right and so now we have broken humans or if they can just veg out they will but this is not [[human nature]] this is broken humans in a system that systematically breaks humans [1330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1330.9s)

and so it's very important to get that in this kind of [[economic system]] that we're proposing there's a fundamentally different education system that's possible because we don't have to prepare kids for the workforce and since we don't prepare them for the workforce the whole goal of education becomes identifying the unique aptitude and interest and fascination and inclination [1355](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1355.62s)

of each child and facilitating the out of it and realizing that they don't have to actually be able to do everything because we've automated a lot of things and then we've shared a lot of things right but what they can uniquely do and what they can light up the most and uniquely doing and then have the benefit of that being fully available to everyone in a commonwealth economics [1376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1376.86s)

that makes radically more abundance possible then for everyone then is actually possible for anyone in this system i'll come back to explaining how that's possible then that's the goal of education right facilitating the emergence of radical uniqueness when i think about what is required in this post-birth sort of society i'm going to call it i think people are optimizers so [1397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1397.47s)

it's more like picking the route or direction that they want to go to and then make that part of the system more efficient over time like i myself do that with every aspect of our lives with our website with you know i'm like an efficiency optimizer no doubt people when they find what their calling is what they want to be doing they're gonna spend a lot of time doing exactly that [1418](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1418.77s)

in in the grander scale the way you say the incentives are all out of whack yeah d motivates them to learn which in turn d motivates them to optimize anything which is exactly what this new system needs and since you identify as an optimizer then you think of it through the lens of that they'll all be optimizing that's a good lens [1437](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1437.94s)

someone else would say that they will all be creating yeah that's me wow they map to each other there they're both different experiences phenomenologically and they actually are different parts of the creative lifecycle and etc right different modes you also have some people who identify things that they're particularly passionate about where all of the topics [1460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1460.17s)

they're passionate about kind of braid together into a very clear through line and there will be other people for whom that's much less clear that are more focused on interpersonal connection and depth of [[subjective experience]] and the creative process itself independent of any particular result that's being produced and one of the beautiful things is that's not possible in a [1481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1481.02s)

macroeconomic system where you say how do you turn that into the dollars you need to live in a macroeconomic system where that's not the question there is a important difference between appreciable wealth and exchangeable wealth when we think about a rainbow it's not extractable and exchangeable wealth for anyone seeing a rainbow when you think about hearing a song when you [1505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1505.44s)

think about somebody complimenting you seeing a smile like none of these are things you can put on the balance sheet in any metrical way but when you think about what makes life most rich it's largely these things that fit into appreciable but not quantifiable wealth and so one of the beautiful things that happens when the primary balance sheet that we're paying attention to is the [1529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1529.02s)

balance sheet of the commons the natural world commons and the built world commons that everyone has access to without possessing is that we have a system that gets to start optimizing for appreciable wealth generation because we're not only focused on exchangeable wealth accounting systems i think we're already seeing that a little bit with the internet where people are producing [1551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1551.01s)

you know they're producing music they're making memes they're writing blogs but they're not really most of the time they're not expecting to make money from it they're just doing it because it's exciting for them or they they get some sort of satisfaction out of just producing it and putting it out there and it's accessible to the world the internet now while those people [1572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1572.999s)

still have to work their day job to support themselves and then they're gonna come to their music and their day job might happen to be something that they experience is relatively soul-crushing in terms of possibilities they know how to access then they come to that little bit of music you think about what would happen if we just supported them to be in the position to [1593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1593.069s)

do music as deeply as they could wanted to right and what if they didn't have to try and gear it towards what was sellable so that they could then switch from the soul-crushing to the money-making music but what was really authentically what they felt was their greatest offering you know their most unique offering we had a very different kind of creativity [1613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1613.799s)

happening one of the issues right now we see in this kind of post fact world where what is fake news and what is not fake news and what one of the issues of the inability to make sense of almost anything that we're facing is how much of any news that you find or any idea has some financial interest associated with it how much education is an advertorial [1640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1640.049s)

you know in some way how much of science itself is actually just the r&d arm of capitalism funded by something that has a vested interest attached and so this is a very tricky process right where what we can actually believe in and then how much of music is geared towards what is going to have the right kinds of frames for me mobility so that it can get puppy enough to sell pepsi or [1664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1664.949s)

whatever rather than what is actually what someone most authentically wants to create that other people's most authentically want to experience you think about what it means to create systems that remove all of those other agendas so that there are no vested interest agendas so now you know we talked about that the criteria from infrastructure what that had to be [1687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1687.169s)

here's the criteria for [[social system|social systems]] we said governance is decision-making economics is [[decision making]] an incentive but we just started to kind of hint at that the incentive moves from primarily extrinsic incentive to intrinsic incentive and you have a system that's all about facilitating in trend generative incentive right which d [1706](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1706.419s)

necessitates most of extrinsic incentive which becomes key then economics is largely about resource allocation systems optimization of resource allocation towards all the various goals that matter so most decision-making in you know governance is around resource decisions law is how do we make sure that those decisions actually get follow through so [1727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1727.539s)

we can actually think of economics as the heart of [[social system|social systems]] right so the key criteria for the future of macroeconomics is that all the externalities get internalized meaning everything that we affect by a decision is factored in the [[decision making]] process and the process by which resources get conferred to things so another way to say this is that the [1752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1752.019s)

agency the incentive of every agent whether it's a person or a group of people called a company or a country even though i believe both of those two things will become obsolete just think any person or group of people any agent the incentive of that agent has to be perfectly aligned with the well-being of every other agent and of the commons as a whole the degree to which the [1775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1775.239s)

individual agents are incentivized to do something that is external izing harm to other agents of the commons is the degree to which those problematic externalities will continue to happen to acquit ously in a decentralized fashion at scale because they are incentivized in decentralized fashion at scale that's the key of the future of macroeconomics is the alignment of agency and [1798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1798.039s)

well-being from individuals and commons and that correlates with closing the loop right we talked about linear [[materials economy]] moving to a [[closed loop]] one right in the same way here we're closing the loop between agency of individuals well-being of others right all the externalities being internalized is moving from an open loop system where i could affect things but not [1819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1819.909s)

internalize those effects in the cost equation - now all internalized in the cost equation and then that corresponds to a world view where my sense of self and my sense of the rest of universe are not fundamentally separate concepts that i wouldn't exist without oxygen at all it wouldn't exist without the plants that make the oxygen i wouldn't exist without the bugs and the fungus [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1843.61s)

that make the plants work to make the oxygen i i am not an individual i do happen to have a self-organizing membrane that has some individuality to it but i am an [[emergent property]] of everything else so when you close the loop between sense of self and sense of other then what's in my best interest what's in the best interest of others also there's a loop closure between [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1864.1s)

advantage self at the expense of others or sacrifice self for the well-being of others both of which are nonsense a radically interconnected system so what we're looking at is how we close all the causal loops so that every thing that influences [[decision making]] is being informed by everything being influenced that sounds like quite a spiritual proposition also it relates to some of [1887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1887.59s)

the ideas that i've heard for example ken wilber talking about sure where this kind of evolution of the system and evolution of the self converge i believe i actually have the quadrants on the whiteboard behind me from a conversation earlier ultimately so if we'll just use the quadrants from integral philosophy for a moment when we were talking about the evolution of [1908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1908.74s)

infrastructure we're talking about the lower right hand quadrant right the plural not just single right external so all the physical infrastructure is the physicality of the collective when we're talking about [[social structure|social structures]] we're talking about the lower left which is the interior right the agreement fields that we agreed to use this word to symbolize this experience of this [1932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1932.65s)

meaning we agreed to denote this value to these things we agreed to make decisions in this way is the lower left upper left is our individual [[value system]] or worldview our internal singular process language is affected by education and culture and media and etc the per right would be human physiology and we usually think of physiology as nature and the other three collectively [1957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1957.97s)

as nurture the other three can change and collectively make up culture which is nurture which is in conditioning the expression of genetic disposition because we are of course changing radically one generation to the next matically much faster than we're changing genetically but that's not an adequate way to think of it because physiology can actually affect human [1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=1980.64s)

experience in human predisposition radically independent of just genome change through natural selection everyone who's had their hormones off knows that you can have be incapable of accessing certain emotions or incapable of being out of other emotion trader when you said their neural chemistry deeply off or just been very sick or tired has known certain cognitive [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2002.34s)

abilities can shut down or other ones be you know over predisposed so when you realize that empathy runs on certain neural networks and that can be down regulated or up regulated right complex thinking runs in certain kinds of neural processes and if those are damaged or not developed it can lead to fundamentalism and only being able to see something one way from a hardware [2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2023.55s)

point of view not just a mimetic point of view right and you can also up regulate the kind of connect tomic complexity that leads to more net information processing and perspective-taking so what has to happen in the upper right so we can think about that the upper quadrants as being about the individual the upper right is kind of the hardware of the individual the [2046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2046.59s)

upper left is the software of the individual right so you can think about human physiology and then human mimetics worldview values definition of success psyche right as the software but of course it's a place where there the software and hardware not as distinct as there are in computer systems every software change is actually plastically changing the hardware and vice versa the [2067](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2067.35s)

hardware's predisposing software so that you can see the analogy but also its limit then you can think of the lower quadrants where the lower right is actually the hardware of the collective infrastructures the hardware of the collective and the [[social system|social systems]] of the software of the collective those for the hardware and software of the individual and the collective [2087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2087.93s)

is one taxonomy that is necessary and sufficient for understanding human experience in human behavior so there are things that condition human behavior in the upper right physiologic predisposition for human behavior predispositions for feeling more depressed feeling happier feeling you know having more empathy less etc there are mimetic [2108](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2108.589s)

predispositions for behavior religions [[value system|value systems]] trauma etc there are economic and cultural predispositions for behavior right as long as that old-growth redwood tree is worth a hundred thousand dollars cut down as timber but it's worth nothing alive on my balance sheet in that economic that extraction arey non appreciable recognizing [[economic system]] is going to lead to cutting all the damn trees down which we've seen and the same with the whale being worth a million dollars on a fishing boat but worth nothing alive in the ocean right like the economics conditions human behavior and infrastructure actually conditions you in behavior it's just a interesting but important point it ends up being not net neutral mimetic aliy right if you have a [2155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2155.39s)

infrastructure where the only way to get electricity is from coal which we know is causing an egg's or bihar to other life right mountaintop removal mining mercury in the ocean whatever but we need electricity to live you cannot have full empathy in that infrastructural system you actually have to down-regulate your empathy to justify getting long and even though you'll want [2179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2179.119s)

to not look at certain pictures and videos when they come across because you know you're contributing new things you actually can't really handle contributing to so you'll turn down your awareness you'll change your behavior you'll turn down empathy because infrastructure is actually predisposing patterns of mimetics and behavior right so all four of those quadrants are [2196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2196.819s)

irreducible to each other but inter effecting so if we have solutions that are in any quadrant only they will be inadequate and what you try and do in any quadrant will necessarily affect and be affected by the other ones so if we want to think about civilization it's not civilization design because we're not talking about top-down architecture it's the design of processes that lead [2220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2220.19s)

to emergence right if we want to think about civilization birth midwifing right it is supporting the emergence of a viable self or healthy resilient civilization we think about the foundational shifts that have to happen in each of those quadrants and you know we mentioned most of them involve closing open loops so that our decision-making is omni considerate our [2248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2248.569s)

decision-making ends up being in the highest good of all that is being affected by the decision what are some of the more pressing loops that need closing right now in your opinion especially moving into 2017 what's happening in the world right now what's happening in the states with the u.s. elections 2017 one of the things that we see is a system a political system that [2272](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2272.46s)

has been breaking and really broken for some time having more complete and obvious breakage and so we see a democratic party that has all of the kind of vested interests that it has co-evolved with and you know damaged structures that it has having supported one of the least well-liked candidates in recent history and anti supported one of the most well liked candidates in [2303](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2303.72s)

recent history resulting you know in its failure the republican party failed to have any really adequate candidates come forward and so a candidate that represented change by being outside of the system won even though in so many ways represented regressive change and so the two-party system as a whole broke each of the major platforms broke and we're a very relatively small percentage [2337](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2337.789s)

of people in the united states used to know that there was real corruption involved in the political process a much higher percentage of people know that now and have less faith that just going to the polls and voting is an adequate solution to the revolution that they might hope happens what that portends for future election cycles and also how people start to have [2368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2368.39s)

civic engagement independent of elections is all interesting right you know trump is a very interesting person in this position with the cabinet that's coming because there's plenty of really concerning things right there's plenty of really concerning things in terms of the embolden be guitry that has already been here you know so deeply but that in being brought [2393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2393.619s)

to the light and the surface and and embolden that way is both more concerning more problematic but also more capable of being healed because it's more obvious represents an existential catastrophic view on the climate and energy but is also starting to be surrounded by some people that have meaningfully better perspectives like elon musk and others so hopefully [2421](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2421.43s)

there is influence potential there but we also see things like really seeking to remove people from office who have had crony capitalists ties for such a long time and propose things like auditing the fed that are actually revolutionary revolutionary and in a good way and so it's very interesting to see what could happen over the next time hear it here but what [2450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2450.559s)

we're seeing is let's let's look at it from a larger sense because similar things are happening in other places in the world right not just in politics but in the failure of several developed countries [[economic system|economic systems]] and you know etc if you think about it in terms of systems theory and complex adaptive systems there's a kind of foundational principle that says complexity will [2475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2475.099s)

evolve within any organizational system inexorably just because there's movement and with movement there are self interacting dynamics and that's going to lead to increased complexity right and so complex is going to evolve within any organizational system until it actually exceeds that organization systems capacity to manage and when it exceeds it you're gonna start getting [2502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2502.22s)

increased chaos and then increased entropy and then the dissolution of that organizational system and then you're either going to get the entropic step-down to the previous level of organization or out of the chaos you get the emergence of a higher level of organization that isn't a retrofit of the previous system but a fundamentally new kind of system that's a place that [2526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2526.13s)

globally i would say we're at we have you know representative democracy is just fundamentally not capable of handling the kinds of collaborative decision-making we need to make right now when you think about the founding of the united states and the time when people would get together in a town hall without representative decision-making right they get together and all vote on [2554](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2554.57s)

something and then someone would have to be represent the whole group who's gonna ride a horse to where all the other town halls met to decide what the state did err it made sense to have representatives for very real technologic limits you know and there were other reasons that were argued but that was a part of the etiology of the whole thing right and then when you [2572](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2572.12s)

couldn't have a town hall big enough for the whole population and so we have an internet town hall beginning for the whole population nobody has to ride a horse we have we we don't need the representatives in the same way we have people that actually have real topic matter expertise it can be groups of decentralized peer-to-peer mavens that [2594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2594.07s)

can actually make relevant decisions based on real knowledge of how those kinds of systems work connected with the data and the facts you know necessary we've and we've already seen these kind of peer-to-peer systems do better decision-making at the scale of complexity there operating than a representative democratic system one so you know that system served evolutionary [2614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2614.69s)

relevance but it is obsolete and if you think about it could you have representative democracy we have people in positions of legislative power where those people are still within capitalism who need to advantage themselves within capitalism as as individuals and members of families could you have representative democracy and capitalism together and not have it [2640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2640.13s)

become crony capitalism well we have never seen it happen and it's just a structural thing it's not just particular bad people right it's just structural you have a system where you incentivize people to acquire stuff and then you put people in a position to legislate in the interest of things that they're more interested in and you know that that's going to happen right so [2661](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2661.099s)

capitalism and you know an [[economic system]] that externalizes as much harm to the commons as possible right and where your profit margin is actually proportional to how much harm you can externalize that pits all different kinds of people against each other in ways that keep enmity unavoidable you know a linear [[materials economy]] that is devastating the past fear that we live [2685](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2685.21s)

on across the entire thing like so that whole system it wasn't [[self-terminating]] when the complexity was low enough that we had a billion people and we cut trees down with access but with the kinds of industrial fishing boats that can just trawl the entire ocean with slash and burn with icbm you know and seven billion of us that same kind of mindset [2709](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2709.01s)

we had becomes very quickly extinction area and so the the scope of our power the complexity of our problems the number of us are making those systems fail now we can think of this as the baby at the end right the complexity of its being kept growing which meant more and more cells which meant a bigger baby until it was at the end of how big it could fit in there and never get out of [2735](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2735.26s)

the birth canal which triggered the contractions for it to come out right now sometimes the mom and baby died in the birth process that can happen but if it's supported properly then rather than die in the birth process you get discrete phase shift into the next phase of evolution and that's exactly where i see us at over the next you know from an evolutionary time period very small [2756](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2756.32s)

period of time which is the ability to have the evolu and emergence of systems that support a globally interconnected human civilization that is actually on the asset side of nature's balance sheet rather than on the liability side so what kind of things can we do as a civilization to kind of aid in that midwifery process to allow for this baby [2783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2783.59s)

to be born any of the places where you can help close major open loops and then do it in ways that can lead to scalability are things worth looking at so if you think about infrastructure the ability to change production and waste management manufacturing to a closed-loop process so you start thinking about could we have decentralized systems of 3d 4d printing [2813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2813.72s)

with modular upgradability built in rather than designed in obsolescence and proprietary nonsense built in and cradle-to-cradle design built in and then have them connected to recycling systems that move to lower entropy and higher efficiency moving eventually towards things like atomic sorting where then the old things get to be brought back into the individual parts to make [2839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2839.88s)

new things all run on renewable energy sources low toxicity low entropy renewable energy sources on the biologic side of that the stem cell meet the vertical farming the synthetic biology as part of the you know creative materials process and then the waste management of the organic fractions it involves anaerobic digestion algae scrubbers etc and so there is no waste [2863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2863.67s)

there is no raw material sourcing that isn't part of that closely building those systems and not just individual technologies but those but the guild's ecosystems of those technologies that lead to closed-loop sustainability of that system and then scalability of those systems that is stuff that is worth building so if you look at building the future of our [[social system|social systems]] and knowing that the goal of our [[social system|social systems]] has to be aligning the incentive of agents with the well-being of other agents in the comments start thinking about how to close the incentive well-being gap how to close the externality gap then building ways to measure externalities and just see them to then be able to quantify them and internalize them those are [2912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2912.75s)

technologies worth building right to be able to build a balance sheet of the commons the built world commons the natural world commons to be able to have data mined sources as well as repurpose the iot sensor systems to have real-time sensor driven balance sheet of the commons right so then we can see where the commons are increasing and their resilience versus decreasing where [2934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2934.38s)

they're decreasing what actions by what you know players are involved in that and you know how to really quantify it those are things that should happen starting to move towards things like robotic automation of the shitty jobs that does allow the ability to have things like a commonwealth economics really start to emerge and then looking at the accounting systems of how a [2956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2956.28s)

commonwealth economics access based systems rather than possession based systems so when you start to think about people's access to over rather than owning a car if you had an uber system where there were enough cars in close proximity for peak time that's the total amount of cars that have to be in the system that's still something like that 20th of the amount of cars that are in [2979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2979.83s)

systems where people drive themselves in the cars spend ninety five percent of their time sitting that's a lot less resource taken out of the earth for actually more utility value safety etc and the transportation system especially as those part it becomes self-driving and then all electric upgradeable and then everyone can have access to the highest transportation possible rather [2999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=2999.21s)

than what you could afford previously and your access to the resource doesn't limit my access to the resource whereas your possession would limit my access so in a situation where there's a finite amount of stuff and the less of it there is the more value is added to it but not real utility value right like even though gold has some real utility value as a as a conductor as a reflector we [3021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3021.109s)

don't use it for its utility value we put it in bars and put it in a safe where nobody really uses it for anything at all other than representational value based on its scarcity but we will damage ecosystems that are actually supporting our atmosphere and cleaning our water and making pollinators work to get to the goal right and because there's enough air that i don't have any [3041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3041.85s)

differential value having some of it over someone else there's no value so we just keep ruining the out of it so how to have a real valuation system that is valuing proportional to real value rather than you know nonsense value that's about differential advantage in competitive systems so building those valuation systems you know those are the kinds of things that [3061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3061.5s)

need to happen building the [[blockchain]] kinds of technologies to post etherium you know kinds of technologies that allow non corruptible contracts and currency and meta currency exchange and governance right so in the [[social system|social systems]] these are all things that needs to happen to bring another feature of [[social system]] and worldview building better systems of education that [3084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3084.48s)

actually help develop children's innate unique capacities and their intrinsic incentive to thrive and experience life fully and contribute to life fully helping to develop and evolve those education systems and then helping to also develop media that gets to support people with real information so the future of sense-making systems and news networks and you know educational [3107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3107.46s)

resources where information that is trustworthy and relevant happens right peer to peer vetting processes etc as well as the right kinds of psychotherapeutic processes for reconditioning people that have went through so much trauma and damage and then being able to be in a position to raise future humans with less damage built world technologies that are [3128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3128.31s)

designed to evolve and support the well-being of the humans in those systems well being sustainable with the planet rather than being cognizant of only very few metrics they affect so that means pain that isn't filled with vocs that are carcinogens and neurotoxins and endocrine disruptors it means paying attention to the kind of lighting that's involved in all the [3151](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3151.47s)

building materials etc for not just aesthetics and the utility of keeping rain off but for recognizing that if humans are going to spend 90% of their time in built structures how do you build those structures in a way that is conditioning off the moment human experience and predisposition of the people who are in those so that kind of intentional architecture and design [3170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3170.95s)

process so all of these are the kinds of things that internalize externalities that do more comprehensive design for all that is affected close the causal loops and don't just support something being better within a [[self-terminating]] system but support the infrastructure the core structures of new systems emerging okay this is interesting a lot of young people ask us for advice on [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3200.739s)

what they can do to contribute to a more positive and sustainable future it seems like from your framework closing loops is the big answer and they can close loops in any number of industries but what would you add to that the fact of them asking you the question is something i would have them look at if they are asking you what they can work on to have their life be of greatest [3222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3222.099s)

value to life it's a great care and if they understand you as people who have studied things that are relevant to that getting input is valuable to the degree though that they are seeing us authorities and they're looking for an external authority to give them the answer to what to do with their life that thinking itself is one of the things they have to overcome and if you [3244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3244.299s)

think about the way most people have been raised as children we very rarely got punished for doing what that authorities wanted us to do and most all of the times we got punished or for doing things that we wanted to that maybe appeal to our own sensibilities or desires intuitions feelings and most of the time that we got praised and rewarded was for doing things the [3271](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3271.779s)

authorities either wanted us to do or you know we're at least aligned with what they figured what we figured from previous expressions they probably want us to do and so this is a very deep conditioning when we are most susceptible to conditioning to look to others to look to teachers and sunday school leaders and parents you know authorities to tell us how to [3293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3293.47s)

live our lives and when we touched our bodies we found that the parts of our bodies that fell best to touch with the parts that we got most in trouble for touching so obviously what feels good to us is bad so we can't trust our feelings but the authorities know that it's bad so we can apparently trust the authorities but not our feelings and no one has ever [3314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3314.29s)

really interested in our thoughts or perspectives they were pre defined right answers to things and we got praised when we got them and we got in trouble and we didn't get them and people were not generally interested in our aesthetic and design ideas they were interested in us keeping clean things that were someone else's design ideas and so we got conditioned very deeply in [3335](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3335.349s)

that system that is part of the system that is [[self-terminating]] because most people are working at jobs that are causing more net harm to the world than benefit that they don't actually feel good about but they do not trust their own feeling or believe that they can do something else or know how to actually figure out what to do or believe in themselves enough to self assess or self [3363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3363.13s)

initiate and most people when they look at various situations in the world actually feel really not okay with much of the way the world is in ways that come actually from love in them they come from beauty in them even if expressed as anger or jaded ness but they don't believe in their own ability to find solutions to figure out so they just numb out name them out on [3388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3388.51s)

alcohol or on tv or whatever they do and so when you look at the people that have ever meaningfully moved the world forward where they solved some problems that had not been solved it really needed to be solved nobody taught them how to do it because no one cooks the problem wasn't solved yet nobody could have taught edison how to make a light bulb nobody could have told gandhi how [3408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3408.7s)

to get home roll for india and one of the fascinating things was that they decided to do it because they knew that it was important before having any idea how to do it and then they trusted in both the rightness of it enough and there capability to learn enough to really apply themselves deeply and to continue through all of the early not successes [3431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3431.8s)

until they found stuff so what i would encourage young people to do is to take profound responsibility for their existence and to know that there are a lot of people in a lot of books and a lot of courses that have valuable should to teach them but if an adequate answer to what they should do with their life existed anywhere that whole thing would be done already and the fact that the [3455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3455.59s)

things aren't done means that all the best teachers and thinkers have not got it yet right they have ideas they have things to learn you should absolutely learn from them and you're going to have something to add not only in terms of your work but also in terms of your creativity so i would say look around at the world and see all of the things that really bother you and realize that them [3478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3478.3s)

bothering you as part of your guidance and see all the things that you really love all the things that are beautiful and you realize they're connected right animals are beautiful and then all of the devastation of animals and their habitat is really bothersome people are beautiful so homelessness and or bothersome right you children are beautiful so bad education systems are [3500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3500.56s)

bothersome so look at what you love look at how what you love is not well supported in various areas and realize that it does not have to be that way any more than the world had to stay dark in the time of edison and yet for all of human history before edison it did right and taking on something that seemed impossible literally delivered the world from darkness in that way right and then [3526](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3526.66s)

study the out of the topic right without thinking that a completely adequate solution is there so there's probably a lot of partially good solutions maybe a technology that is totally good technology but it hasn't market feasibility hasn't came about yet or the way to bring the meme out there or parts of the ideas are there but they need synthesized or whatever it is study [3546](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3546.85s)

is a problem well study what an adequate solution would look like gain a real clear inside of what adequate solution looks like in your own area of what you care to contribute to as things emerged that you feel like you can contribute to as you're learning about it contribute to them and continue to assess on your own and initiate on your own with of course good input from [3570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3570.79s)

all the places of good input that's the key thing i would say take really deep responsibility for the impact that you have in your life while you're here and then all of the study all the training all the application that you need to empower the kind of impact you want to have make sure that happens excellent advice right yeah daniel thank you for joining us this has been [3592](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BofVO-4yNc&t=3592.18s)
