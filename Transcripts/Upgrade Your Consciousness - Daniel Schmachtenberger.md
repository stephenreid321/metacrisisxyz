hello and welcome to the psychology podcast with dr. scott barry kaufman where we give you insights into the mind brain behavior and creativity each episode will feature a new guest who will stimulate your mind and give you a greater understanding of yourself others and the world we live in hopefully will also provide a glimpse into human possibility thanks for listening and enjoy the podcast [18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=18.539s)

music daniel it's so great to have you on the show today i'm happy to be here thanks for having a lot of things we can talk about you're a very a very interesting guy which is why i wanted to get you on this show i knew there was lots of areas that we could discuss i'd like to first start talking a little bit about your childhood because you had a very [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=55.26s)

interesting educational path isn't that right or a different i did have a different educational path different and interesting yeah both yeah tell me a little bit about it and inserted how you solved the education system yeah i didn't know much about the education system because i wasn't exposed to there was a i was home taught growing up and i went to public school for a very brief [78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=78.72s)

period a few times as an experiment and few different private schools but the vast majority of my childhood education homeschooled and the reason was my parents were kind of educational philosophers and were interested to see what would happen at the kid didn't have any fixed curriculum and was just exposed to all the things they could be exposed to and then their interests were [101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=101.4s)

facilitated so it was a very kind of constructivist idea so that was it i didn't have a certain amount of social studies and geography and math and handwriting in english i it really was just a facilitation of questions fascination and interest so the few times that i did go to school there were obviously gaps in knowledge that everyone else was learning like i had [122](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=122.88s)

never shown much interest growing up in american history and understanding states and capitals that kind of thing they were areas where i was setting things that were well outside of the scope of anything that would normally be touched in school and so we didn't it didn't translate very well what was of course wonderful about it was i got to not only go very deep in [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=143.37s)

the areas that i had a main interest but my actual interest in life itself was fostered by having the interesting topics supported and not being forced to be focused on stuff that was of interest yes it sounds like you were a pretty curious person and you got a chance to actually run with that as opposed to being held back by that ba the term curious person and child are synonymous [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=167.52s)

that's a good point that's a good point you do see individual differences though in curiosity and maybe that is partly environmental supportive and as well as i think genetics do play a role you know in terms of dopamine production and their genes that code for dopamine but i think that that's a good point in a lot of ways from evolution perspective you need curiosity right you need or to [190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=190.92s)

adapt i mean if you but child who's not gonna explore their environments at all you know the child will not be able to adapt at all what do you study in college i studied the math physics philosophy and undergrad psychology more philosophy in graduate school but then getting into ecology biology medicine [[complex system|complex systems]] most of that wasn't in a formal academic situation it was in [215](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=215.85s)

independent studies and research environments for instance medicine was working with some different diagnostic laboratories working with medical doctors and clinics on complex cases and working to try and find insights that were outside of the scope of what we currently had insights on well what was the college you went to undergrad was mauri university in what our university [236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=236.78s)

worth it looking it's in iowa fairfield iowa it was a very kind of unique school that was focused on studying the sciences with a deeper thought process around subject/object relationship cool so when did you start to think about putting together this neuro hacker collective how did that come about now hacker is a relatively recent project we started it about three years [261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=261.0s)

ago and i have gotten into integrative medicine and kind of diagnostic medicine therapeutic medicine especially for cases that both allopathic and integrative medicine didn't have adequate solutions yet partially because of my own diagnosed illnesses that didn't have adequate solutions that i had to work on and some of which had a [281](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=281.83s)

neurodegenerative component so i got deep into understanding how neurological systems work how dysfunction worse and because there weren't any adequate solutions offered anywhere of course the only like meaningful option was see if novel insights can be generated by approaching it differently and so i started applying cybernetic theory how do the bottom-up and top-down regulatory [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=302.919s)

systems in the human organism work and whole systems and complexity theory how do all of the different comics and all the different body systems interact and have cascade effects and etc and it ended up leading to a set of hypotheses about how health works how aging works and how illness works and then how illness in a case like mine could have worked led to me being able to do some [327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=327.159s)

kind of unique research diagnostics find things out that traditional medicine had not that led to me actually being able to treat and reverse the conditions i had that were you know reverse autoimmune antibodies reversed things that are not usually medically thought of as reversible which led to me then doing that with a lot of other people who had you know working with [345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=345.759s)

various integrative doctors who had also what are traditionally beamed as uncurable cases and getting to see that we could reliably reversed some kinds of pathology and then this was very meaningful and that we could address not only physical pathology but meaningfully affect people's cognitive and psychological function because with chronic disease with autoimmune and [368](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=368.919s)

neuro degenerate capacity and their emotional status is always affected and its affected in ways that have to be supported for them to be able to do what it takes to actually do the rest of the treatments to have the focused drive etc to do generally a meaningful amount of work and so that's what really kind of led into an integrative approach to the future of psychopharmacology [389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=389.77s)

psychoneuroimmunology psychiatry and then starting to look at not just addressing issues to come up to baseline but also we end and space lab so this is kind of the intersection with biologic transhumanism can we do fundamental bio optimization and that then intersected with the other thing tank work i had been doing while i was working [[complex system|complex systems]] which is how do we support the major transitions and civilization writ large that need to happen for environmental sustainability for major macro issues that we're addressing and there's economic shifts there's governance shift there's infrastructure technology shifts that have to happen but there's also recognizing that all of the major issues that were wanting to address are human [431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=431.739s)

behavior mediated and all of the new capacities were wanting to bring about are also going to be human behavior mediated so then looking at the human physiological and psychological predispositions for more omni considerate or shittier behavior and what can we do to be able to predispose on the physiology side predispose human hardware towards increased complexity of [455](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=455.559s)

thinking perspective taking capacity and prospective synthesis capacity emotional resilience etc all the things that would decrease the predisposition for harm externalizing behavior and increase the predisposition and capacity for on the considerate what do you think are some of the aspects of [[human nature]] that's getting in the way of compassion and kindness where some the biggest blocks [479](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=479.619s)

it's going to be a very deep question that we're probably going to go into a meaningful rabbit hole if we do because the topic of [[human nature]] versus that nature is expressed is a very deep one what is [[human nature]] if by that we mean genetics who cares because genetic expression ends up changing radically our genetics largely predisposed neuroplasticity so we can be radically [505](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=505.329s)

mimetic creatures if by nature we mean that which is inexorably unchangeable well that whole concept is nonsense in a genetic engineering world one of the things i love about crispr even though i actually don't think we're nearly as close to being able to utilize crispr safely as we can learn but one of the things i love about it as a [[thought experiment]] is as soon as we are now realistically thinking about being able to change the genome or whole idea of nature change conceptually it's a great [[thought experiment]] to say well even if we did evolve to have inexorable competitive or whatever traits now do we want to keep those or not when you have that level of [[exponential tech]] where you can change the connect don't [544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=544.91s)

change the genome the level of existentialism and ethics to say what is a desirable set of traits becomes poor right you have to address it the core science doesn't do desirable right it does what is not what about historically so how do we actually make a scientifically commensurate ethics and existentialism as part of the core of our work but if i was to just pass [566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=566.0s)

forward over all the subtleties i wouldn't say what do i think are the aspects of [[human nature]] that are in ignorantly problematic i would say none i think there's a lot of aspects of [[human nature]] that lead to problems when the right conditionings there but i think other sets of conditioning lead to fundamentally different expressions of that same nature and so there is a [587](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=587.72s)

propensity for human agency for the impulse to self-actualize if that is growing up in the context of zero-sum games and finite games from a [[game theory|game theoretic]] perspective that can look like lack of empathy pathological competition selfishness if you're growing up in the context and your neuro plastically wiring in the contexts of positive some games where winning doesn't require [613](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=613.7s)

others losing which then requires and loving to the pain of others losing ie shutting off empathy and in infinite games where you are not winning to win but you're winning to keep playing right what does it mean to keep playing so you can't externalize harm when you change the games here at our constructs i think the fundamental impulse to agency self-expression naturalisation and the [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=634.3s)

fundamental impulse to communion connecting with others can be simultaneously optimized without any fundamental dichotomy so the problems are the [[game theory|game theoretic]] level which means an economic worldview mimetic structural level not a which in effect of course genetic expression but are not fundamentally at a genetic expression model sure i definitely heard you're [656](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=656.93s)

saying in it as you know i'm a big fan of abraham maslow's thinking and you just used the term self-actualization and you know when he talked about is man fundamentally good or bad he says he thinks it were neutral and you know it just depends on what are the sort of conditions that are getting what needs met and what needs not met so i do like to think of it from a nice perspective [680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=680.059s)

it looks like you kind of would agree with that sort of perspective of neutrality in a way or what part of the human condition do better in a highlight i think that saying neutral is fair meaning we can have an environment say we go to some part of north africa where female genital mutilation is ubiquitous or we go to the dark age we're burning women as which is which of equities we [702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=702.079s)

can now look at that from outside or retrospective as a like liquidus insanity right of the insurable population they were like infected with a psychopath logic said it means we when we look today at the fact that we externalize harm to the environment with almost every single action we do and we still think that war is a reasonable solution to differences and we step over [723](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=723.709s)

homeless people while we go get more shit future generations will see us as we pick with ously insane psychopath logic mmm ethically i'm sure that and yet of course when anyone's in there a big widow psychopathology it's just called normal so we obviously have the possibility for a level of terrible shit terribly like scientifically optimised torture that no other animal had we also [744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=744.709s)

have the capacity for levels of insight and rapture and charity and selflessness and no other animals i mean we're these just radical potential capacities but i wouldn't say we're neutral because universe is neutral the nature of evolution itself is that it selects for more orderly complexity that has new [[emergent property|emergent properties]] and it doesn't select for the opposite right like there [770](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=770.179s)

is a macro tilos directionality to evolution that goes from non-life to life from prokaryotes to eukaryotes from plant to neurology from reptilian mammalian etc so life isn't neutral change is moving in an orderly complexity direction and with humans right now look we're at this very interesting place where we can actually understand that because of our capacity [793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=793.1s)

for abstraction and choose to participate with it and our technological capacity is big enough that if we don't self-destruct and so we're at a very unique point right now at the beginning of the escape velocity on [[exponential tech]] where we have existential tech right nuke was the beginning but now it's becoming decentralized existential [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=812.99s)

tech so we will either have the negative traits that we have had for a long time self-destruct us where we will emerge into fundamentally net positive traits because it's the only way to make it through so this is cool so we do have existential tech and you're in a lot of ways developing the office of that what do you call that what's the opposite of existential tech [834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=834.35s)

technology that enhances us in a way that makes us more pro-social and cooperative what is that call you can call it on the considerate tech omni consideration is a term that you could apply at different scales when we're thinking about working in human biology medicine well being on the consideration would mean what are all the pathways that are affected by this chemical or [857](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=857.57s)

this therapy other than the ones that were intentionally infecting which are usually what we call side-effects and how can we be considered across the entire system including what will the effects be in the future are we down regulating an internal regulatory system or are we operating its capacity or so i'm going to consider it at the level of human physiology would be just factoring [876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=876.77s)

all the externalities progressively better on they consider it at the level of the environment would be factoring all the externalities what affects the whole [[supply chain]] environment romney considered at the top level is recognizing that we are not really separate parts that can think of our own advantage and disadvantage and win lose games separately but we in effect each [899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=899.78s)

other powerfully not only in fact the biosphere powerfully enough that we are all really [[emergent property|emergent properties]] of the biosphere [[emergent property|emergent properties]] of the whole so we have to think about the balance sheet of the whole thing right of civilization and the whole how do we support that that's omni consideration applied to tech and choice-making writ large we had dan siegel on this podcast where we had a very similar conversation about the interconnectedness of of all life forms but the thing is i mean it must be frustrated you must be frustrated you know i mean you you see something you kind of see it true that i think you know you're quite right i think a lot of people take this for you as well i think a lot of buddhists [940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=940.25s)

take that view i mean kind of see that but there's so much in the world of people that refuse to see that view i mean the american politics patel is you know one example of this polarization seems to be hot right now you know for lack of a better word and it so must be really frustrating and what do you think we can do to convince people on the level which they will be receptive to it [962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=962.48s)

how can we have them see that you're me main protaganist slightly differently american politics isn't just dysfunctional it's broken right it was breaking for some time and last election we got to see the republican party not put forward good qualified candidates the democratic party take people's favorite candidate and not support them and support someone who is highly [985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=985.76s)

unfavored we got to see the two-party system as a whole break down like it was the beauty of what happened was what only a few people were really acutely aware of almost everybody became acutely aware which is that it is a no longer adequate system for how we do governance and so we see this kind of increasing chaos there and not just in the us but with brexit with issues in crudo with [1007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1007.93s)

chews in russia like around the world we can see a movement towards nationalism because of problems with globalism but also problems nationalism like we didn't have 7 billion people ever right we only hit a billion pilla 1815 for the first time after two and a half million times and we didn't have this level of technology per capita in the world this month resource capita so we're in a [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1033.1s)

fundamentally different scenario than we've ever been and we needed a different kind of [[decision making]] a different kind of economics and it would take us a while to get into it but in the next 15 years 30% of all jobs will become obsolete from technological automation that is a that will be a complete failure of capitalism unless we do something like a basic income because [1052](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1052.809s)

not only you won't be able to move people to other jobs because ai will be automating other jobs so you've got guys like elon who are famous capitalists saying go to basic income which is not capitalism and it's also not long-term sustainable the critiques of it are also it's on the path to something that is not marxist socialist capitalist but fundamentally new stuff it's mediated by [1073](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1073.0s)

new technological capacities we didn't have in previous levels of economic theory so i don't think it's just about motivating people to see something different because the the thing that we need to move to hasn't been sealed right it's emerging it's about now actually developing what solutions for a ongoingly viable civilization in the presence of the technological power we [1095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1095.71s)

have what that actually looks like and then building that so it's demonstrated success creates an exodus from the failing system to a viable system i mean there is a in terms of the seeing aspect and seeing different perspectives i mean something more fundamental and that's just seeing the value of not being selfish there is this innate human tendency that to be selfish and i mean i [1118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1118.27s)

hear you talking and i hear someone who's making abstract arguments that are not implication of you and only you but people i just see a lot everywhere i see people who were making decisions solely based on them and only them and that's obviously problematic for them in the long run ended the rest of the planet but it's hard to convince people of that because of these strong ego protection [1144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1144.34s)

drives you notice that as a kid they might think about them and only them and then maybe as a parent they think about them and their kids right as someone who steps deeply into a religious organization they think about them and their people whatever their religious group is if they become nationalists in a deep way as a citizen they think about them and their people as a citizenship [1166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1166.059s)

or as a race so this movement from egocentric to ethnocentric to rather there's identity of who we are connected to that expands and the direction of evolution is more inclusivity into a world centric and cosmos centric how do we recognize more that we're interconnected with and include that in our circle of care and choice making i think the key thing to recognize right [1187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1187.779s)

now is and this is a hard one but civilization the main ways that we have done civilization so far are coming to an end and fundamentally new systems will emerge if we are to continue you making it if you talk to people who are studying coral and ocean acidification [[dead zone|dead zones]] in the ocean ocean temperature rays etc they'll say we have a very short number of years to [1212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1212.37s)

make the oceans cooler than they currently are or actually dying slowly at the current temperature and we depend on them you existing right off lankton that supports the atmosphere the same is true across so many you know it 15 years to 30 percent of the jobs found that means a switch off of capitalism in a very short timeframe where [[climate change]] is not a chinese issue or an indian issue or a u.s. issue it is a human on earth issue and more than human right it's like a mammal on earth issue so is nuclear disarmament so are the threats of [[exponential tech]] we've never had a time in the history of the world where all of our issues were interconnected global and existential you had like gandhi dealing with an indian issue you had people leaving [1256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1256.29s)

britain to go find some new lands start america there's no new land to go find somewhere else you can't leave the problem and you can't say somebody else can continue to be problematically any country continuing in the wrong direction with [[species extinction]] or [[climate change]] strategies is enough to take us over the tipping point so we're at this unique place where our global [1277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1277.44s)

interconnectedness and power is such that we either all collectively identify that we're in this together on this tiny little bitty spaceship called earth floating through this vast cosmos and we up regulate how we do everything to have no externalities to be omni positive or we all don't make it together basically win-lose games are over because we are too big for the playing field what it [1300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1300.51s)

takes to beat the other guy actually destroys the whole playing for them now we move into either or lose those games but there it's one of those to win win or lose lose yeah in order to have that perspective that you really have to take the long perspective beyond yet you have to be able to imagine the planet and care about the planet beyond your your very puny 80 years max if you're lucky [1322](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1322.41s)

you know or a hundred years in max you know perspective yet you have to think about beyond that and and i don't think a lot of people really are thinking beyond that if you look at the fact that we're looking at geoengineering which could have radical consequences to our atmosphere in the world for many generations because we are so desperate about temperature [1342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1342.33s)

chains in the next few years the issue of coral is being addressed in the next five years it's not years the issue with everyone losing their current jobs the next 15 years this is this is if people have children before their children grow up they won't be growing up into a world anything like the one they grew up in so you actually don't need very long reins thinking you just need to pull the [1363](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1363.0s)

ostrich head out of the sand actually have a look and say stop what does it actually take to close the gap between the trajectory we're on and on we need to be in to know that's fair there are certainly are issues that are that we need to be awakened to within right now no i definitely take that point we talk about the tropics and define that that's going to be a new term to a lot of our [1386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1386.97s)

listeners so i don't want to just throw that word out there can you explain what that word means and what people were doing in that space sure no tropic as a term it was defined with the development of molecule called piracetam the beginning of the research in this area really deeply which means a chemical that can enhance some aspect of cognitive capability beyond normal [1410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1410.519s)

baseline without meaningfully negative side effects and it's a rough definition but that's still generally how it's used so some aspect of parliment enhancement could mean short-term memory or working memory or long-term memory or focus or concentration or creativity or analysis or synthesis or you know some of those things and hopefully more of them and beyond baseline means not just taking [1432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1432.5s)

someone who has brain fog and getting them back to normal capacity which say someone has a deficiency of some key nutrient the brain needs supplementing those brain nutrients could get someone back up to baseline but it's not going to get them beyond baseline because that's part of the [[evolutionary environment]] that evolved to baseline these are going to be things that [1451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1451.38s)

modulating modifying some aspect of normal physiology typically when you modify a normal physiology there's some trade-off effect that occurs where you get some negative somewhere else so the idea that you can enhance something beyond baseline and not have a meaningful negative is this kind of like magical unicorn idea but it actually seems to be demonstrating itself is true [1469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1469.99s)

in a number there is where and this is in contra distinction to both let's say brain nutrients that would just bring you back up to baseline if you were deficient or other forms of medicine that would bring you up back up to baseline if there's some pathophysiology or say you're dealing with anti-inflammation of brain inflammation or whatever or some smart drugs that can [1489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1489.94s)

increase some aspect of function beyond baseline but have meaningful consequences methamphetamine at all etc right and depending upon someone's physiology these have the ability to modify dopamine acetylcholine whatever it is depending upon the kind of drug it is but typically those single drugs synthetic mechanisms they work through some process that overrides the way the [1515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1515.35s)

body naturally produced that chemical that transmitter which means if you use them long term you can get down regulation and dependence ie addiction and often times are modifying one chemical in a way where that chemicals getting kind of fixed based on an external stimulus so you're less adaptive and that chemical that was in a dynamic set of ratio for the bunch of [1534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1534.73s)

other chemicals the other chemicals aren't also being effective so in other words you'll get a narrow set of positive effects it's only going to affect some aspects of the function you get side effects and down regulation so no topics are the exploration into how to up regulate things ideally lastingly at minimum without lasting orders do we have data on the [1558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1558.55s)

long-term effects of trying to tropics like over the lifespan some we have grasset am starting that field was started you know was studied in the early 60s and so we now have people who had multi year and multi decade use and we have different kinds of performative tests as well as you know brain scans blood chemistry many other rasa tabs many other amp akane's different [1584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1584.74s)

categories nootropics have longer-term data but we haven't been able to study this field as well as we would study normal things in medicine because our kind of western modern model for medicine as if this is based model where if there is a disease we're looking at treating the disease we get a lot of funding because we'll be able to get fda approval and then you [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1605.07s)

know sell a drug so for enhancement where you're not treating a disease you're not going to be able to get fda approval you're not gonna be able to sell it as a drug and there's a whole set of like our whole process of studies factors what we call risk benefit ratio where you're willing to have some risk and study because there is a disease that if you don't treat there's risk of [1628](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1628.44s)

getting it and so how do we do risk benefit ratio for enhancement it's a totally new topic but it's a topic that's being explored everywhere in transhumanism right now brain chip interplant implants you know gene therapy etc and nootropics are one of those fields so there's a lot of quantified self data and have like the early people in [1648](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1648.299s)

steroids who made a lot of mistakes but then actually learned a lot about endocrinology that the endocrinologist couldn't learn that had advanced the field of endocrinology and now made you know we have psalms today that have the same positive effect with a tiny fraction of the negative effects of the early anabolic steroids that came about through that kind of citizen science [1667](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1667.74s)

testing of course at the cost of some of the people the tropics has had a similar curve and so we have data but the data is not as deep long-term and robust as we would like it to be and it will be yeah i've been reading a lot of blogs from people who have been treating themselves human guinea pigs and trying lots of things i have to say i have to thank you for introducing me to the [1687](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1687.299s)

whole idea of nootropics it's a fascinating world and it really has inspired me i would say to to really understand what you know there clearly are some nootropics that are more well studied than others that's for sure and i don't think they're all in an equal footing i don't think you would say they are at all now you created something called qualia right this was very well [1707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1707.07s)

researched so you put together 40 ingredients is that right that are synergistic with each other yeah the current version of auliah has 42 ingredients but we have many many many different iterations and versions so what's the difference between nootropics and what are called smart drugs the difference we nootropics and ssris for instance where are the [1729](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1729.45s)

difference between those so just to be explicit about something that's probably obvious so medical disclaimer part nothing that we're sharing here is medical advice i'm not a medical doctor thank you for saying that your podcast and me and neural hacker aren't giving medical advice etc so this is just general information and anything that one wants [1749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1749.43s)

to explore regarding medicine they should go check with a alright profession on that front i accessorize are actually a they approved medicine for treating certain diagnosed illnesses primarily psychiatric and some other illnesses and they're one category of psychiatric madness other meds that modify serotonin and nearly opposite ways ssris and tricyclics two different [1772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1772.08s)

things dopamine modifying gaba modifying etc kind of things in the in the field of psychiatry psycho chemical smart drugs is a term that generally means a pharmaceutical that is being used for an off-label purpose meaning a doctor didn't give somebody drug for this purpose but an off-label purpose for enhancing some aspect of cognitive [1795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1795.6s)

function and these will usually either be narcolepsy drugs that are going to promote wakefulness the utero x and a female arm and f and all that those kinds of things they will be sometimes anti alzheimer's and parkinson's kinds of things l-dopa and tune episode things like that or say psychiatric meds wellbutrin that are all debra nell and some of these can [1818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1818.61s)

actually be balancing for certain people's physiology depending upon what's out of balance but most of the time these will serve some kind of psycho stimulatory role in a way that will lead to long-term instability and the risk-benefit is deemed worthwhile in the current field of medicine because it's addressing some real dysfunction for somebody but in general i don't [1843](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1843.84s)

recommend much in the way of smart drugs and it doesn't mean that there's no positive application of them but i recommend people be highly educated before exploring and then explore conservatively i appreciate that what i'm trying to understand is how is the difference but to like your qualia nootropics in general they do affect and they do target neurotransmitters they do [1864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1864.84s)

target like dopamine production serotonin production that's exactly what that says with target serotonin production how is that different so let's take a look at dopamine princess sono favorite it's my favorite molecule yeah it is a favorite for everybody the dopamine opioid axis right the kind of pain pleasure [[reward circuit]] axis is one of the deepest evolutionary biology axes in [[nervous system|nervous systems]] for knowing what to avoid and what to go towards and so major aspects of how pain pleasure dynamics work etc are their most ocb addiction is a dysregulation of that system it's a profoundly deep system even if someone also has serotonin or bottle or other things to address so dopamine is the first of the catecholamines so it [1914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1914.17s)

converts to northen efrain and then to epinephrine and those are all kind of stimulatory neurotransmitters dopamine has a lot to do with focused attention concentration also pattern analysis and pattern recognition pattern isset ii it's why if it's excessive you can get full pattern recognition single to schizophrenia oh yeah yeah and if it's deficient you'll have lack of drive lack [1937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1937.09s)

of motivation as well as inability to recognize patterns adequately so under performance it's not more or less that we're interested in it is the adaptiveness right it's how the dopamine process can self-regulate well because when you're trying to relax and fall asleep you don't want to have dopamine peaking you want it to be able to chill and you're trying to concentrate you [1958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1958.93s)

want your body to be able to up regulate so one thing is rather than give someone a dopamine agonist that is going to elevate dopamine kind of no matter what we would like to be able to give precursors and then the conversion factors on those precursors and other things that support your body's dopaminergic processes so that it can do its own basically you think about it has [1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=1982.96s)

the body as an internal and endogenous regulatory system how do we support that regulatory system to self-regulate better so what dopamine dopamine is you have a essential amino acid phenylalanine it gets converted to tyrosine it gets converted to acetyl tyrosine it gets converted to l-dopa it gets converted to dopamine it has to travel a process and apps [2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2004.809s)

where it's broken down by chemicals like mao-b and then it has to get up taken and the postsynaptic dopamine receptors and there's differential up taking the d1 d2 d3 receptors that affect how it processes and it can also be broken down by hydroxylase into norepinephrine etc so if someone doesn't have enough phenyl alanine enough tyrosine if they don't [2027](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2027.129s)

have enough of the phosphorylated version of b6 that helps convert or vitamin c or copper that helps convert the amino acids into l-dopa and then into dopamine if they're mao-b levels are excessively high or they hydroxide these are all gonna lead to imbalances in their own regulatory systems so we were looking at common regulatory difficulties and how to be [2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2048.48s)

able to support the systems have increased regulatory robustness and so therefore you're less likely to see grow side effects yeah right so think about you know when i when i was talking about the amino acids the vitamins and minerals were necessary as cofactors plus the synaptic transmission plus the receptor site modulation we're looking at multiple steps across a whole pathway [2072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2072.609s)

and we're seeing where the rate limiting effects and how can we support those and but then that's just opening right and so increased concentration without increased working memory ends up being pretty lame and so increased working memory is mostly not dopamine lot supported right it's mostly mediated by acetylcholine and other transmitters and the compte yeah well so that now [2094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2094.81s)

we're looking at enzymes again right yeah and so if we're wanting to increase short-term and long-term and working memory and intensity of focusing on concentration but also the capacity for task switching well it was we kind of modeled from a cognitive science perspective what are all the things we're wanting to affect or what people call the synergy of those things are [2115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2115.93s)

cognitively available creative productive flow states of that what are the underlying physiological pathways that mediate those and then how do we support those pathways then let's look at synergies between them sounds like a fair approach well i do wonder though okay so in listening to this could be like well like how you why are you why do you have so much [2138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2138.55s)

confidence you were not formally trained you're not you could imagine a doctor listening to this and and just immediately dismissing this whole thing is saying well look i'm not even gonna listen to this because he didn't even go through med school what do you say that you know so i was like like why are you so confident in what you're saying well having a lot of respect for what we [2159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2159.28s)

consider better methods of interdisciplinary education and traditional specialist education usually does we also have a lot of respect for people that the cutting edge of their specialties that formally trained in it so you know this wasn't developed in isolation this development was working with many doctors were working and integrated facilities running pre and [2182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2182.17s)

post blood labs and we actually started with you know having some medical directors i want to play with us and particularly with patients they're having a hard time with him he said we show again risk-benefit made sense to them because they were having a hard time they said we think we've got an approach that could help and so we were customizing chemistry based on looking [2200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2200.38s)

at their genome their clinical chemistry their clinical intake etc and then getting to see really profound shift not just in subjective reporting but in those same biometrics being tested again and so then that that's actually where we started in the formulation process and then started to say well what things are pretty common across most people who have similar desires or symptom ology [2221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2221.53s)

that we could before getting into personalized medicine be able to meaningfully affect at scale so the doctors were contributing to the insight of you know how we did formulation and then we've had a number of phd neuroscientists of different disciplines neural chemists on petition we're all scientists etc look at what we're doing give us feedback on at a number of [2241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2241.27s)

different kinds of doctors psychiatrists and integrative mds and etc look at it and give us feedback on it many doctors just find what we were doing start using it in their clinics and contact us and saying you know here are the effects were seeing in patients they were very positive so we're actually just starting to put together a program to kind of like harvest this that or better how we [2263](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2263.68s)

can be distributed science and of course once we came to a place that we felt good our own internal testing on formulation which had many rounds we did a formal safety data sheet we had you know which looked at all of the research meta analysis structured review on all the ingredients and etc and we had pharmacists look at it doctors look at [2287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2287.2s)

it hd neuro chemists look and i i went through you know i don't take anything at face value right so i mean i looked every researched every single one of the ingredients and i like spent like a day on each one i was like because that one's very potent it's very potent so racetam starting with piracetam in them there's many other racetam zener asset an impressive them do different things [2310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2310.49s)

but their primary effect is up regulating acetylcholine uptake in the nmda complex so they're learning helps with learning and memory learning memory working memory but also sensory motor nerve capacity and so they are allosteric modulator zat the nmda complex and then which racetam will have differential effects on gaba receptors or dopamine receptors etc so rasa tems [2336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2336.23s)

are really the first kind of major area of metroplex that people get into it anyone gets into no tropic and then because they're they're affecting the postsynaptic neurons uptake of acetylcholine then they'll usually start stacking them with some choline donors may be some acetyl group donors and then maybe some things to help the acetylcholine get across the synapse [2356](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2356.63s)

like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and so you know that's how you can kind of start to stack the pathway for acetylcholine the next major category that people really kind of come to get into with no topics that are very meaningful are amp athene's which are glutamate uptake on the postsynaptic neuron so much leaders of the ampa complex and up regulating the [2376](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2376.64s)

glutamate up taking increases the speed of synaptic transmission but also decreases excitotoxin from excessive levels of glutamate and that staying in the synapse so new pet new pet has am packing like and racetam like properties at the same time meaning that it up regulates both due to main and acetylcholine uptake in the postsynaptic neuron which is quite unique aniracetam [2401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2401.48s)

also does both of those but does it more potently and so there's research showing it as being neuroprotective because it is specifically protecting neurons from excitotoxin city damage while typically you could decrease excitotoxicity from glutamate by just scavenging glutamate and you can use things like oxaloacetate to do that but then you're decreasing [2423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2423.59s)

the speed of glutamatergic transmission so new pep does this unique thing where it decreases excited lexus city while increasing glutamatergic transit transmission released support minute so new pip is a very interesting molecule from the standpoint of being both neuroprotective and increasing a number of interesting dimensions of learning attention and and one of the [2443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2443.98s)

big kind of holy grails the space is working memory yeah i see a big in terms of holy grail it turns the future of this is it's it's obviously it personalizing dosage because there's individual differences in genetics that that help regulate neurotransmitter production and how in some interactions so i'm sure you're working on that area right so we are and you know being able [2469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2469.01s)

to have integrative doctors psychiatrists neurologists general practitioners get support and better and better methodologies for assessing brain chemistry and not just brain chemistry but endocrinology physiologic chemistry etc and then putting all that together and then being able to work to balance and optimize it that's hugely important and it's an area that you know we are [2492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2492.71s)

working in and working with some small number of doctors to kind of prototype methodologies but also working on structures that could be brought more widely but there's also things that we that could happen that are not dr. atheras mediated so imagine a portal where someone can take cognitive assessments online using best in class online cognitive assessment that has [2515](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2515.12s)

been correlated to best in class and personal assessment and shows high accuracy and also online psychometric assessments and so that people can see how their pattern recognition their work memory but also structured subjective insights into their you know psychologic state predisposition etc and they could track that in time then imagine they could load up into that same portal [2539](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2539.83s)

and somatic portal and they control their information so it's not being used by anybody company for reasons they don't want that they could upload their motion tracker data their content by itself there's loop tracker data and then maybe even if they go get medical blood data qyg data and then the system doesn't just look at each one of the [2559](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2559.0s)

psychrometric s-- and biometrics on their own in relationship to a reference range but starts looking at what is that whole complex of data with all the other pieces tell us that is synergistically more than the separate pieces right you could imagine like a fitbit for this literally tracks this stuff throughout the day absolutely so we are looking at the intersection of quantified self data [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2578.53s)

harvesting sounder adoptable biometric diagnostics and better psychometric diagnostics and then the synthesis of all that knowledge to then be able to customize protocols both at the level of medical protocols where doctors can use it and at the level of just direct-to-consumer wellness protocols now for that imagine a version of qualia that is fully customized where we get to [2599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2599.98s)

take all this data from someone and then customized which chemicals and which amounts are in there that requires a robotic we automated compounding pharmacy that can make a custom formulation from a bunch of powders based on an ai generation of their specific formulation based on the biometric data that's complex to do it's a dream of ours we want to we want to [2621](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2621.4s)

get there and be able to do it and we're definitely worked on how to do that but it's not right around the corner yet but maybe in our lifetime oh and do much sooner than that are you familiar with note six experience machine full of philosophical experiment no you know he has this [[thought experiment]] you know imagine if we could hook you up to a machine and it [2641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2641.11s)

gives you whatever it is desirable or pleasurable anytime you want it turns out most people would not want that because they want to the will is something about the human will about suffering and overcoming suffering that makes us human that makes us want to gives us a sense of meaning in life ultimately the kind of vision you have for this world at which i share and i [2664](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2664.48s)

and i think is really quite admirable we'll have to go beyond nootropics right i mean it's only part the whole system of cultural changes of personal changes as well that is willed right yet so let's just roughly break down four categories that we can look at this in terms of that are not reducible to each other but are all under effect sounds [2688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2688.39s)

good let's think about human physiology which includes our you know eeg pattern computational neuroscience stuff our neural chemistry or endocrinology the our microbiome genetic expression just all of the things that affect what you can think of as the human hardware so there are human hardware predispositions for i mean if you just think about consciousness running on that hardware [2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2710.41s)

then then empathy runs on certain neural networks utilize utilizing certain neural chemistry etc that can be up or down legged it can be down regulated by head trauma by microbiome imbalances by toxicity can also be operated by a number of things so let's think about the human hardware predispositions and capacities let's think about human software being our [[value system|value systems]] or world view or understanding themselves or understanding of other right now they're they're not hardware software as totally distinct categories like they are in computers because of course they are dynamically intersecting each other continuously in real time that's means that the neural plasticity where your thoughts are affecting physiology and your physiologist predisposing thoughts [2755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2755.74s)

it is a it is a completely intimate link between them but we can so roughly think of those categories so on the software side we have education we have media we have psychology with [[personal development]] psychotherapy etc on the hardware side we have not just medicine but the future of well-being optimization and those are both at the level of the individual then at the [2776](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2776.74s)

level of beyond the intuitive level of the collective kind of the hardware of the collective is infrastructure how we meet our physical needs in relation to the planet water energy agriculture transportation in factoring waste management and then the software the collective is the agreement fields that run over that is [[social structure|social structures]] economics governance [2797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2797.289s)

language ultimately the hardware and software of the individual and the collective all have to be upgraded and for this kind of phase shift that humanity is entering into and upgraded towards omni positivity meaning that each of those four have things that affect human experience in human behavior the environment right the lower-right infrastructure that the [2822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2822.18s)

build world and natural world environment affect you can experience and affect your behavior so do the social agreement fields culture economics etcetera economics what we incentivize very directly affection behavior what we have status of allocated to etc our definition of success in the individual and human software and our physiology so we would [2841](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2841.049s)

say no topics are just the first part we're getting into of human physiology which is just one of these areas and all of them are necessary but only all of them together makes efficient yeah i appreciate you outlining those for that topology there are heart there are things we can do software wise that can show the same effects on phy ology and physiology as the nootropics [2864](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2864.299s)

in some case like meditation can get you in a state of mind it's so there's different routes perhaps to this upgrade there's not just a single route and there are multiple routes that can get you the same place perhaps some time same place and sometimes different but related but highly synergistic places when they come oh sure yeah for sure and that's the beauty of self-organizing [2885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2885.42s)

systems and i mean that's the whole point of systems right is that you want to get to a point where they're all integrated and that the entropy is minimized we were just talking about whole systems and self-organization yeah and by understanding how whole systems works leads to a perspective that emphasizes synthesis of all of the meaningful modalities one of the [2905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2905.549s)

concepts that we have to get over that is kind of reductionism in the negative sense rather than positive as the word is kind of looking for single bullet silver bullet solutions you know a single molecule that's going to fix this whole thing well it wasn't a single molecule that was off there was a whole cascade of systemic effects that were off and so is it human hardware or is it [2924](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2924.779s)

human software or is it the environment or well it's usually all items some kind of complex so the question becomes if someone's physiology is off how to balance it can lead to their psychology being out of balance which can lead to their physical make more at once and you get a vicious cycle you can also get virtuous cycles of creating lift and meb areas making it [2944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2944.41s)

easier for better behavior and function in those areas creating more lift so our interest is how do we stop negative feedback cycles and how do we promote virtuous cycles positive feedback cycles between by the mind relationship environment right between all of those intersecting complexes and how do we meaningfully synthesize and support all of the modalities are actually effective [2966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2966.37s)

no that sounds like a great goal i mean you have our thoughts you know like cognitive behavioral therapy effects do the way we frame things don't way we make meaning out of our experiences effects our cortisol production it affects you know our negative reactions so we it in all these different they're bi-directional you know yes all these different ways daniel thank you so much [2986](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_1tnGL5eQ&t=2986.71s)
