my point is that in today's internet age things that are short and concise and things that are certain an absolute [[climate change]] is going to kill us all or [[climate change]] is a hoax those things get more views more attention seconds to use your language than something that's well it could be this and it depends on this and those nuanced assertions well so this is interesting i think this is obviously that's something about the [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=31.5s)

way the brain the neurophysiology and psyche together are being conditioned by tech and culture and the economy together and obviously we're looking very specifically at things like the way that facebook and platforms like that trying to optimize time on site and engagement identify the the stickiest things keep people from bouncing and those happen to be the limbically [55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=55.739s)

hijacking things so use literally personalized ai level technology to double down on the worst traits in humans at a multi-billion person kind of trillion dollar scale but that's not that's not our inexorable nature that's our nature being conditioned for a specific purpose but it is something we have to overcome and that we have to work with here and i [78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=78.18s)

think this goes to the topic you're asking of like foreign thinking about grand narratives just in general being able to think about the whole well enough that we can think about solutions even to parts that don't mess up other things the minimum required complexity of just reality is such that we do have to recondition [98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=98.64s)

ourselves to be able to uh seek instantaneous certainty and instantaneous solutions less and be able to take the time to go deep enough in the thing you really get the insights of what the many different causes are not a singular cause is that a skill like [[meditation]] or how does someone develop that yeah i think [124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=124.88s)

um you know when we're talking about the [[social media]] thing and obviously this is not only [[social media]] there are different kinds of [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] this is kind of also why it's interesting to think about it in terms of brain and evolutionary biology versus conditioning there are kind of one marshmallow [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] and there are two marshmallow [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] and the and also people know the two marshmallow experiment um the one marshmallow [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] when you have an economy that makes a lot of those available which evolution didn't make a lot of one marshmallow [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] available um typically you had to actually perform evolutionarily relevant work to get rewards of various kinds and one of the [170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=170.22s)

things that we've been able to do in that specifically economics has incentivized is being able to take the thing that there's a evolutionary reward attached to and strip it from the thing the work that you would have to do to get it to make something that sells better that's what the supply side is the supply side is incentivized to drive demand right and [190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=190.86s)

so we've talked about this before of like what fast food is to food i didn't have to under gather or whatever and i just get a concentration of salt fat and sugar with maximum palatability stripped of fiber and micronutrients so it hits all of the dopaminergic you know reward centers but neither has nutrients in it nor did it actually require any [214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=214.14s)

evolutionary activity of my body right and that's pretty much the same thing that porn is to actual sex which involves intimacy and relationship and you know lots of things like that so we're getting the pain we're getting the payoffs without the work in our culture without the work and without the actual even deeper nutrients right without the the deeper fulfillers so if i'm hungry [238](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=238.379s)

and i crave mcdonald's there's this fascinating thing where people who die of diseases of obesity are actually also dying of certain types of micronutrient starvation because every time they eat more stuff and they get filled with calories and micronutrients they're actually not getting trace minerals they're not getting phytonutrients and so then the [258](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=258.0s)

hunger is even deeper it's not a real satisfier right it's a pseudo satisfier so not only are they not doing the work they're also not getting the deeper thing that the the salt fat sugar was evolutionarily bound to the other micronutrients that were needed and the same thing in terms of people don't get a sense of deep intimacy and connection and the [278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=278.4s)

meaningfulness of life from porn that they would from an actual intimate relationship and they don't get it from [[social media]] that they would from real friendships and the real friendships mean i can't just be an and then bail i actually have to work through all the human conflict which means i have to look at how i contributed to it which means i have to become a better person [298](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=298.08s)

but it's hard bringing it back to the original question in ancestral times we would have been sitting around a campfire hashing out the complex problem that we faced and so our brain power wasn't a limiter there but what's happening now is two things number one the situation is unbelievably complex and it can only be understood in a individual mind you [325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=325.199s)

can't get a climate expert an energy expert an ai expert and a psychologist in a room and each of them opine on their part of the [[metacrisis]] and then assume that everyone understands everything it has to be assembled in a an individual mind and then hopefully you'll grow the number of those minds but first of all it's it's complex and second of all we're being bombarded by [352](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=352.8s)

the facebook and and other things competing for things that are not relevant to our future that are not giving us a full healthy experience both calorically and mentally and and otherwise it's actually something that you said about the uh must be processed in a single human mind it's important i want to come back to but just to make [375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=375.0s)

sense of the detour and why i was mentioning the thing about in food and online relationships and all those areas there's like a [[hypernormal stimuli]] that is separated from the rest of what made it evolutionarily relevant is um and that's kind of the one marshmallow [[reward circuit]] rather than the two marshmallow [[reward circuit]] that involves some self-application for some kind of um delayed and healthier gratification is uh that obviously is also the case with the kind of [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] associated with [[sensemaking]] and understanding the one marshmallow [[reward circuit|reward circuits]] are to get certainty very quickly without the work [412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=412.979s)

of actually trying to study and understand the situation and just so that certainty is a one marshmallow that makes sense so i know what in group i'm a part of because we're all outraged at the at the terrible trumpers or the dumb lib tards or whatever it is on the other side i know what in group i'm a part of and i feel safe because there's lots of us and we're really certain and [435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=435.36s)

we're really sanctimonious and um and i get that feeling of like there's a false sense of identity and esteem and kind of the maslow's need sense which is sanctimony right i get to feel esteem because i feel so obviously smarter than the dumb ones um who think the other wrong thing and um i also get to feel the security that is associated with feeling certain even [460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=460.86s)

though it's a false certainty and so i would say those are those are the need for belonging and the need for security and the need for esteem are all getting hijacked getting turned into political warfare in a way that is useful for political parties and people who want to sell their wares and whatever else it is um but those are all the one marshmallow [483](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=483.12s)

award circuits of like wait did i actually read all of the literature on [[climate change]] in depth or on vaccines or on whatever it is and really come to sense make this on my own or did i get a sense of certainty really prematurely and really kind of hand it to me um so similarly when you're saying like what are the skills underneath it i think the skill of like the quality of [504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=504.96s)

earnestness in our desire to understand the reality we live in and the earnestness associated with just a pure desire to for for clear understanding as well as a desire to be effective and the recognition that if my map is wrong i'm not going to navigate well even if especially if i am falsely certain and then the willingness to sit in uncertainty for a lot longer the willingness to not be part of an in-group that is certain the willingness to let go of the kind of moral righteous superiority and to sit in the uncertainty of that so that i can without bias actually come to make progressively better sense of the world [545](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=545.16s)

and then to still never get certain because there's always more stuff that i don't even know high bar to to reject certainty and sit with uncertainty and sit outside of your in-group isn't that a rare human that can do that um statistically rare in the current environment yes requiring genetics everybody doesn't have no [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3dhRuAxBXk&t=570.44s)
