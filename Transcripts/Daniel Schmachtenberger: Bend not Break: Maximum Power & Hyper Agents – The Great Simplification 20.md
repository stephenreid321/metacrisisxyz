this week's podcast is a second installment of a conversation with my friend daniel schmucktenberger we intended this series to be a three-part series on bend versus break but we got a little sidetracked with both interesting and i hope relevant and helpful uh tangents on energy maximum power animist religion and the importance and relevance of hyper agents or those human individuals who have outsized influence on our cultural direction daniel and i uh come to this with wildly different backgrounds and we've kind of found each other on the internet and are learning from each other and exploring and trying to figure out uh the path ahead and basically share our revelations and our thought process publicly because i think we need a lot more people engaged in these questions in this space at this time [67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=67.28s)

i hope you enjoy this conversation i certainly did here is part two with daniel schmucktenberger okay this is podcast number two um with you of a three-part series at least and what i'd like to do today is um kind of merge our meta world views on how energy materials technology money human [102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=102.24s)

behavior all aggregate into an explanatory systemic overview of the human condition the human predicament as it pertains to all the risks that we're facing um you and i have been kind of playing verbal mental ping-pong on this stuff for a couple years and our we have a huge overlap in how we [128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=128.8s)

see this stuff and i'd like to kind of hone that overlap uh to converge on on maybe a unified thing that we both agree on today um i will go back to the podcast missionary position of me interviewing you this time as opposed to last time you interviewed me but maybe if if it makes sense to you i'll just give like a one minute overview of what we covered on the first uh podcast on bend versus break which was called energy blind and the reason we did that as opposed to starting here is a lot of people are still naive about the relationship between energy and the human experience we talked about how important energy is in nature how energy in biological systems is the currency of life the same as human systems we are massively supported by a hundred billion barrel of oil equivalents of fossil sunlight added to our systems every year there's a big energy quality difference [199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=199.36s)

between so-called renewable energy which is robust and viable but can it empower a 19 terawatt system in in our current way is is a big question we talked about jevin's paradox which is the rebound effect that new efficiency and technology help you save energy on a micro scale but on a macro scale it ends up buying [224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=224.239s)

more stuff and having more surplus and we end up using more energy in in aggregate uh and we talked a little bit about um you know the tenuousness of of oil supplies and depletion and things like that um so uh i hope everyone can go back and listen to that as a precursor to this um so good good afternoon to you where [248](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=248.48s)

would you like to start uh this conversation my friend well just that it's been a few months since we did that last one and i'm really excited that we are finally getting to this you and i had had a conversation offline where we uh explored some of the topics in more depth and i think they're really interesting and useful frames so i'm [269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=269.28s)

excited for us to kind of get to dialogue through some of those things that we had discussed and get to expand the topics when you and i spoke last time i had got the good fortune of having you explain your models to me i read the [[superorganism]] paper and watched some talks but i never actually read your book and in prep for this time not because i [290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=290.32s)

didn't think it'd be great just because of scheduling uh i did get read the book and i just want to make sure that all of your readers that have not should go read his book because it's excellent it's so well structured it uh you know nate is uh so in his career studying [306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=306.96s)

uh what is the world predicament and basically took the uh most important frames from the nature of how humans understand stuff and how we kind of get understanding wrong to human motivation to evolutionary perspective to energy and infrastructure like that and just kind of put it in these chunks very well [325](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=325.199s)

chunked but like summaries of stuff that each would be a book and so it's like whatever 100 books summarized um in a nice sequence so i just wanted to acknowledge like a  brilliant book that was so well done i was so happy reading it last night um and uh you know what i think uh you and i both kind of came to independently was the awareness that there are many different uh potential [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] meaning different escalation pathways to the end of this [[world system|world systems]] viability that even though they look really different whether we're talking about um resource shortages that lead to war that lead to kind of large-scale war or breakdowns of [[supply chain|supply chains]] or [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] directly in ecological tipping points that there are some things that all of those have in common and if you try to treat the amazon hydrological pump here [378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=378.88s)

and the [[dead zone]] here and the soil depletion here and the [[species extinction]] here and the nuclear escalation here and the ai risk here and the biorisk [[arms race]] here as separate issues uh you're going to fail because they're actually all unsolvable without solving the underlying kind of generative dynamics that give rise to [397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=397.759s)

them and each year we keep getting more of them as they're more new tacky and the new tech increases the kind of destructive capacity both unintentionally through externalities and intentionally through [[conflict theory]] war and so we keep getting more total [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] higher probabilities on them more interconnections and [414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=414.8s)

cascades between them so it's impossible to keep managing the front of that so it's like what what is underlying those which ends up looking like diagnosing what about civilization is kind of [[self-terminating]] it's a little bit like the difference between the kind of traditional allopathic medical approach and the [434](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=434.4s)

anti-aging work right the traditional medical work is like okay well maybe we can keep you from dying from heart disease but we have most by a year because your cancer and your alzheimer's and your diabetes are immediately following because you're aging and you're aging poorly for a bunch of underlying systemic reasons that the homeodynamics of your body aren't [450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=450.479s)

working that well so whichever system gives out first doesn't make that much difference so if you want to do more than by a year you have to look at can we age better comprehensively which will affect all the systems so what are the underlying dynamics so the kind of anti-aging work is thinking at a much more fundamental way about patho pathology in general and [466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=466.56s)

pathogenesis in general rather than specific applications and it's very much like we're doing that for this [[world system]] and just to close that you you did it in a particular way that i really appreciated that was very overlapping with but a little different than the metaphors i used and i think that's why we got along and i think getting to [486](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=486.08s)

show the mappings between those is insightful so that's what i'm hoping we do today yeah excellent uh thank you for your kind words uh on the book um as far as aging you know we're part of a system and that's what i've tried to do that's what you're trying to do is explain how the system functions together as far as anti-aging if everyone lived to be a 150 a wider boundary perspective [509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=509.28s)

on that is we would have some more massive ecological problems as well so it depends where you draw the boundaries on this stuff um okay so yes i have described the system as um we self-organize as families small businesses corporations [533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=533.12s)

[[nation state|nation states]] to optimize surplus but it's not really surplus it's financial representations of surplus and that's tethered to energy tethered to carbon and that this system is out of control as a [[superorganism]] um a [[superorganism]] it's not really a physical entity it's just the behavioral dynamic of eight billion of us roughly [557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=557.839s)

um just pursuing these cultural objectives uh and it's no longer in anyone's control there's no politician or billionaire that is actually steering it so that that's kind of the dynamic that i've come up with is that we have outsourced the planning of our system to the financial market [581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=581.92s)

and that momentum worldwide of making decisions to keep that optimized suppresses any other paths of wisdom or constraint that might be totally viable and makes sense there's just no fertile soil for those to to germinate and so i would like to get your unpacking using your language and your work on that dynamic and how you see [609](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=609.6s)

that you already summarize so much stuff in your book and if i was to summarize that and like the few concepts that give if someone had to hold a very minimum set uh that i would that i might offer would be that the financial system has an [[embedded growth obligation]] it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interest thing which means you have an [[exponential curve]] so there is an exponential [[embedded growth obligation]] on finance but finance is bound to the real world and you can't exponentially grow the extraction in the real world [652](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=652.079s)

specifically you can't keep mining stuff on renewably and turning into pollution and trash and you can't keep having the energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around um indefinitely so uh and that specifically this the combination of the jeven's paradox and the coupling of uh money and energy is a which you know is a i'll say the garrett relation but um nate will say what's wrong with the gate relation i'm only saying it vaguely is the idea that there's a coupling between global gdp and energy that is an important coupling to understand and roughly that coupling is anything that makes money is probably [692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=692.72s)

moving atoms around in physical space or moving bits around but it requires energy to do so kind of across all industries some will boom some will bust but they're all going to take energy so there's some rough correlation between total money and total energy use it's pretty clear what you mean when you say moving atoms around that would be materials but what do you mean when [710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=710.56s)

you're moving bits around just to be clear computation still takes energy and so even when we're talking about uh capital associated with digital goods and services it's still energy dependent it obviously takes energy moving atoms around to make the computational substrate you got to do a lot of mining and you got to do a lot of fabrication [731](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=731.36s)

to make the computer chips and the servers and the satellites and whatever and then the computational systems require energy so the movement to digital doesn't get us off the need for energy right well so what you're saying is the cloud is not virtual and approximately 18 of our electricity today goes towards the servers and the gadgets and the wiring and and everything like the cloud is definitely not virtual cloud has a uh physical substrate layer that it depends upon that has real physics and energy dynamics associated so we can of course get into the way that maybe digital goods have a slightly better [772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=772.56s)

efficiency in terms of how much energy they take per dollar than the physical goods but then this is why the jeffers paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any returns too there will be a power law distribution on return so i can get 1000x return of course i'll [790](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=790.88s)

get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know a large amount of capital we'll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren't profitable now become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands and this jevon's paradox just like [811](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=811.279s)

everybody who's focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is one of the key inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas become profitable and the market [831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=831.44s)

expands and so that efficiency doesn't buy you the thing that you want it to have so the [[embedded growth obligation]] still holds and so you're like okay so because of that we still get this coupling between dollars and energy dollars are on an [[exponential growth]] curve up that means energy has to be on an [[exponential growth]] curve up you can't do exponential extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning uh hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons out the energy return on energy investments and diminishing return and yet it has to keep up with a very verticalizing [865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=865.36s)

uh part of the [[exponential curve]] on um finances there's a problem there right like and you can only quantitative ease and subsidize that thing for so long there's like a fundamental problem there and so of course the answer is just renewables well great we'll meet all of that energy with renewables except right now the energy return on energy of investment of [884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=884.48s)

the renewables means you got to use way more oil to get the non-oil producings off and the curves still just don't work in the current way we're looking at it so there's just some very deep reckoning and the relationship between the [[embedded growth obligation]] and finance and the physical limits of the real world atomically and energetically and the relationship between those there's a [902](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=902.32s)

heap of complexity from there but that simple summary kind of gives you the [[exponential growth]] of the metabolism of the [[superorganism]] as nate has argued it which i think is insightful and then we want to kind of take that as the base input with whatever nate's about to say and then play from there i agree with everything you just said uh because i would like to put oh well that's why then naturally um so one thing that we didn't get to in the first conversation that you um indirectly referenced here and i i wanna i wanna unpack it a little bit is how money comes into existence and how that relates to [949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=949.36s)

gdp growth and future expectations so money does not come into existence the way that's taught in economic textbooks we do not make a loan from existing capital 95 percent of our money comes into existence from commercial banks making a loan and when they make the loan they create the money so if you're a bank and you have 10 million dollars on your books and assets and liabilities and you daniel come in and have this great uh no tropics business idea and they say you're a great guy we're in good standing with the federal reserve we're going to give you a million dollars for your business at that moment [992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=992.0s)

your account went up by a million dollars the iou asset on the bank account went up by a million dollars you can spend that million on anything you want presumably a business in the bank is equal now they have 11 million in assets and 11 million in liabilities but the same amount of coal oil copper water amazon forest existed on the planet that did 10 minutes earlier we created more financial claims just based on the recent productivity of you and our country and our world as a reference there was no [1034](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1034.959s)

biophysical reference at all the other thing that's important to note is when that million dollars was created the interest was not so there that's the underlying [[embedded growth obligation]] is we create money with no tether to natural resources but when you have to pay that million [1058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1058.16s)

dollars back to the bank over every year you're gonna have to pay five percent interest as well so you need to grow um to to do that now debt doesn't have to be a bad thing if you take a loan from a bank if the productivity of your uh results are higher than the debt [1080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1080.799s)

but what ends up happening now as a world not as individuals we're doubling our debt every eight to nine years as a as a world and we're only doubling our gdp was which is the income stream required to pay back that debt every 25 years or so and that's before energy declines entered you know peak oil it's like you were saying declining [1105](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1105.44s)

marginal returns to hydrocarbons so this is a real problem so um money isn't created out of thin air that's going too far uh because there is productive capacity and capital and industry and technology and knowledge but there is no recognition that all the [1124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1124.48s)

financial claims in the world be they stocks or bonds or pensions or retirement fund when they are cashed in they have to be cashed in on something that will require energy and materials to qua to convert and and that is just a fundamental disconnect in macroeconomics uh the bank of england wrote a great little paper modern money creation [1149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1149.679s)

that debunks how it's uh written in the economic textbooks so i i just wanted to add that that bit in there um the other thing i wanted to say is all governments and institutions at least ostensibly in the world expect two and a half to three percent growth into the future that is like the [1173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1173.6s)

standard expectation out 50 years so given the tether of energy and gdp which is around 0.99 to 1 globally and given the tether of materials to gdp which is pretty much one for one you refer to that as atoms so the link between atoms and gdp growth is pretty much one for one we've we've grown our material footprint 2.8 a year since the [1199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1199.76s)

year 1900 so given that if we grow at 3 percent a year in order to maintain and service the financial claims that we're adding all the time we will double the amount of energy and materials used on the world in the next 25 to 30 years and we'll double it again after that that is a serious problem um that more people need to think about because i don't think the next doubling is going to happen and so how do we respond as a culture to that so that that was my pin and your in your subjects um you know the the thing that we're saying [1246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1246.32s)

right now is hopefully adding a little bit of clarity to a really basic intuition it's like the most basic hippie that gets said in the kind of renewable de-growth world of you can't run a uh exponential economy on a finite planet forever it's like everybody's kind of heard that if you paid any attention environmentalism because a financial economy and a [1265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1265.76s)

[[materials economy]] can't be totally decoupled right like and of course people get excited about no no you can't decouple them because the digital universe doesn't have to require the [[materials economy]] or services don't have to require the [[materials economy]] and we can do more thinking stuff well kind of but as we were already mentioning you know about the cloud and like that the [1283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1283.84s)

digital economy the services economy still require [[materials economy]] and the growth of them still requires growth there and even if you get some increases in efficiencies which is awesome you get those increases in efficiencies those increases in efficiency also grow the total material economy in a pure market system because the market system is going to take returns wherever it can [1300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1300.96s)

get them yes with a caveat globally because there are countries that are decoupling materially not not absolutely decoupling but they're relatively coupling like our country we are producing uh less or more gdp while using not less energy but less than one for one and we've been we've [1324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1324.72s)

been doing that for a while but if you but you look at the average american consumes 57 barrel of oil equivalents of coal oil and natural gas of three main fossil fuels per year but we consume another 17 barrel of oil equivalents in stuff we buy from china and bangladesh etc because we've outsourced our means of production uh overseas so globally what you just said is correct [1350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1350.4s)

but there are countries who can material decouple but i do not believe that the whole world can material decisions just restate what you said in another way individual country metrics on things that involve global [[supply chain|supply chains]] are just always gibberish they're basically always some kind of [1369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1369.12s)

green washing gibberish and i think we got into this uh last time but in case we didn't i'll recap quickly um it's very easy to export your shitty thing somewhere else um and then you know import like i i can import stuff from a country that has slave labor i don't have slave labor i can have a very good genie coefficient in my country but i'm my country depends upon stuff that [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1389.6s)

depends upon slave labor so what does my genie coefficient really mean it just means that the really up genie coefficient i externalized somewhere else and so um to me that's just called cooking it means your jenny coefficient has narrow boundaries yeah so whether it's my genie [1403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1403.84s)

coefficient or my um joules to dollars ratio if i'm externalizing the shitty metric somewhere else but it's still on a closed biosphere and what we're talking about is limits of the biosphere all we're doing is cooking the books right like this is just basically bad accounting and and cooking the planet india just announced today their their coal uh consumption is up twenty nine percent i'm not laughing at cooking i'm laughing at the pun that just naturally emerged there um but yes well it's it's um it's it's horribly tragic um crying is [1439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1439.12s)

probably more appropriate than laughing but in order to maintain the the increased air conditioning because of the the massive heat in india and pakistan they have to burn more coal so that is a positive feedback uh that is just it's profound yeah um you know i i first came across this [1465](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1465.36s)

there's a there's an indian man who explained the situation to me in a particular way that um music i hadn't thought about quite like this before he's said look [[climate change]] is not going to hit the world uh evenly to begin with it's going to hit [1482](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1482.24s)

certain areas much worse the places that have air conditioners and good aquifers with you know running water and those types of things are obviously going to do better the places where you have high population multiplied by high population density and that are already in hot areas the you know extreme weather events are [1502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1502.64s)

going to hit a lot worse so he's like india is really going to get screwed well before europe and the us are but it's because europe and the us have air conditioners that they built with and his number was something like 50 trillion dollars of extraction during british rule of resources us i mean current equivalence from india [1521](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1521.36s)

and to be able to build that which was both the use of all the hydrocarbons that got us to this [[climate change]] position plus also what protects them from it would but what also keeps them from having the resources to be able to deal with it themselves and then say pull yourself up by your bootstraps to another country and that put him into a kind of like [1540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1540.159s)

um eco-terrorist point of view of like what choice other than taking the west out do we have is this not a genocide of negligence and it's like that's not a invalid perspective right uh genocide of negligence is a is is a thing we can actually look at and a lot of people when they think about [1562](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1562.48s)

[[climate change]] think about like systemic venusification of the planet but well before you get to systemic venusification which might never happen depending upon the model getting the 50 celsius heat waves over the next few years in places like india in bangladesh and pakistan that have high populations with high population densities with low [1582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1582.08s)

ground water with low food resources uh that can lead to crop failures like the new gate resource wars those resource wars can scale to global wars there's a war over resource in northern india turned into a cleaving on you know hindu muslim lines does that become an india pakistan war there's a lot of places where things like this come so this is again a global issue you can't [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1605.12s)

take it as a local issue even if you were sociopathic and only cared about your country these things escalate to global issues very quickly and the timeline on stuff like that totally totally this year could be next year could be we can't guarantee because it's a [[complex system]] where you can't forecast well but it's it doesn't take venusification timelines for those [1623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1623.2s)

things to occur music no and the only thing i would add there is even wider boundaries is the genocide of the oceans and the complex self-aware life in the oceans where 93 of the heat generated so far has been absorbed by the oceans [1644](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1644.48s)

because they can absorb it but but there there too is a limit so um i think personally [[climate change]] is the largest risk uh for our species and civilization by two orders of magnitude having said that i don't think it's in the top ten uh in the next ten years um of the the various [1666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1666.159s)

risks that we face so just to you know come out of the closet on that i care the most about future ecosystems other species long after i won't be on this planet but i think we have like in your language the governance and regulation and and the the the inner beating heart of the [1688](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1688.159s)

[[superorganism]] that is where we have to work and come up with solutions uh because there's lots of other things the the financial recalibration the uh nuclear war risks a lot of the other things you talk about um uh crispr and ai and polarization and all that just to continue on your tangent for a moment um and then we get [1711](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1711.12s)

back you were mentioning caring about the uh complex life in the oceans and obviously the the rest of the non-human life that we have been uh genociding or displacing this is why our mutual friend aza raskin who co-founded the center for humane technology has taken a good chunk of his time off that to do the earth species project and i just kind of want to [1730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1730.159s)

mention it because whether it succeeds in school really soon or not just even thinking about it is very interesting and cool they're using ai's uh most cutting edge i mean google's ai cutting edge translation software to translate between languages to try to translate animal languages with the idea that if we could actually listen to the [1749](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1749.039s)

whales and what they had to say in the dolphins and understand the depth of their sentience it might be a wake-up call and uh yeah i think that's a cool project that if they succeed in translating other species languages and figuring out how bonobos or [1768](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1768.64s)

starlings or whales talk to each other my biggest worry there is that humans on mass will just shrug and say no big deal where you know my my core belief here is we need a new sacred standard religion and economic growth for everyone have kind of been our our goals our aspirations and at the end [1792](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1792.0s)

of the day my belief is the sacredness of the natural world that we inhabit and share with 10 million other species that is what really matters at the end of the day but now we're getting way self-tangent from this respect right back into where we're going through another tangent but i see the loop back so indulge me okay um [1814](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1814.32s)

your concern is that even recognizing the much greater consciousness sentience of other species that we can't currently talk to wouldn't change because values are the change in values isn't going to change behavior in an [[economic system]] that is incenting behavior in a direction that follows this [[embedded growth obligation]] to convert the entire natural world into currency so obviously values can influence our behavior economics can influence our behavior the other key thing is that technology directly influences our behavior and there's a coupling between these we've talked about the way marvin harris models these three in [1853](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1853.52s)

terms of civilizations being made of infrastructure [[social structure]] and [[superstructure]] the [[social structure]] is kind of the social agreement field the law governance in particular and the institutions that mediate how do we do our social agreements the infrastructure is the [1869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1869.84s)

tech stack that that rides on the modes of production agriculture energy waste management all that kind of stuff and the [[superstructure]] is the what is the definition of the good life what are our ethics what is the basis of the jurisprudence of law and so that could be religion nationalism all those types of things and so um different social theorists will argue which of these is most fundamental we i would argue that these three are co-informing we can show call loops where each one can inform the others um a lot of what we're you know obviously the goal that aza has is can we make a play in [[superstructure]] can we make a play in the understanding and human values that would have a somehow bind our economic incentive on our use of technology and economics and the technology are related because obviously you can't venusify the planet with stone age tech right you can't blow the planet up with stone age tech it's [1926](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1926.559s)

um all of our [[catastrophic risk|catastrophic risks]] are mediated by tech because otherwise we're not powerful enough to do at that scale and but obviously our tech and the incentive structure to grow and use it in particular ways and the laws on binding those ways the relationship of all that kind of goes together but just to give [1943](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1943.679s)

an example because so many people there's a paper we're writing a consensus project that'll be published by the time this comes out on why tech is not values neutral a lot of people have this weird kind of conception that technology is just values neutral i can use a hammer to build a house for the homeless or i can use it as a weapon but there's [1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1962.399s)

no value embedded [[value system]] embedded in the hammer it's just the [[value system]] the person that chooses to use it and that would be the same with everything in our industrial [[supply chain]] and they either have that view or some people have the view that tech is fundamentally values positive that's kind of the generals [1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=1980.48s)

um hobbesian pinker and you know gatesand kind of view of the dialectic of progress that tech only gets selected for and the market only upregulates it if it's solving some real problem that people want and they're willing to pay for so of course it is inherently liberating humans from problems that allows them to expand and so it's fundamentally net positive um then there are the lewis mumfords and everyone who have critiqued why that's not true and many people then can go in a luddite direction of like no tech actually messes up religions and societies and ecosystems and so tech is fundamentally net negative to our [[value system|value systems]] i would say we're arguing in this paper [2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2019.6s)

all three of those are naive tech is values affective it affects it in a complex set of positive and negative ways and very much in the same way that tech will produce some positive thing in the physical world but also externalize some negative things it doesn't have one effect it has a complex set of effects and we need to factor the positive and [2038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2038.88s)

negative externalities in addition to the thing it was supposed to do and factor that into design that's also true in the psychological space i want to get into where i was going with that but did you want to say something neat i did i want to i want to add something and then ask you a question saying that from a tech standpoint i [2059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2059.839s)

would say that we would not be able to venif venusify the planet without fossil hydrocarbons because my friend steve keane says that um that's what i would call industrial attack body well a body without energy is a corpse and technology without energy is a sculpture and so our cities without energy [2086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2086.079s)

are a museum de facto so my question to you is is energy values neutral no and we'll get to that but let me come back to the tech thing there obviously without an internal combustion engines oil is not worth all that much um obviously without uh intellect electricity and electrical grid we don't  need all that so basically the [2111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2111.28s)

energy is driving tech tech is also without oil drilling which is tech you don't get the oil without oil refining which is tech yeah there's a there's a positive feedback and there in in my earth day talk i refer to it as the economic trinity that information energy and materials are bound and that [2131](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2131.119s)

you need all three so we're gonna go into that but let me finish this loop because it's where there's it connects back to um the binding of these and why a good example of why tech's not values neutral and your other friends other than humans on the planet so tech allows us to exploit energy in [2153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2153.599s)

different ways like our ability to drill and refine oil and then use it to run tech that requires energy and obviously energy gives us the ability to develop new techs and you get this positive feedback in that and so oil was this massive increase in our ability to use energy before that the last massive increase you might argue was agriculture and the ability to [2174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2174.4s)

make a huge amount more caloric surplus per acre with grains and with that particular one obviously baskets were a part of it in a number of things but the plow was a huge part of it because the plow moving from kind of the digging stick and um to oxtron plow the clork surplus skyrocketed and with it obviously population did and then oil was the next big one and it was way [2199](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2199.04s)

bigger right um but uh when we look at the plow this is a classic example of kind of the way tech is not values neutral and related to values on animals you following the plow many kind of historians have argued that following [2214](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2214.16s)

the plow animism died everywhere and animism was nearly universal before that most all of the kind of in wait i didn't know that what most all of the development of the plow for oxes animist religions fell out of i didn't know across this in sex ecology and spirit by uh wilbur and i've heard a number of there's obviously the [2236](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2236.48s)

historians have deep detailed arguments on it but i'll give the kind of general just an argument is that the you can be a hunter and kill a buffalo while still being animistic you can pray to the spirit of buffalo you can take no more buffalo than you need and use it all well you can cry when you [2255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2255.119s)

kill it and then say you know i'm eating you we're going to get buried when we die and become grass that your great-grandchildren will eat and we're part of this great cycle of life so i can let an animal have a free and sovereign life and be a predator and be part of that and still kind of be animistic but i can't yoke a buffalo i can't breed it into an [2275](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2275.119s)

ox yoke it cut its testicles off bind its horns and beat it all day long and be animistic and still respect the spirit of the buffalo um i have to say it's a dumb ox it's here for us man's dominion over and change the mimetics to do it and um so the key insight here is that the plow using the plow the plow existing actually i want to construct this very specifically the first part is that tech that is highly advantageous to use is obligate you don't get to not use it and make it through history and so somebody else will use the plow they'll grow their population because of the massive caloric increase they'll make it to the famines if we don't then [2320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2320.16s)

our tribe will get killed by them and or die in the famine so even if i don't want to i have to and if i don't i don't make it through history so very adaptive tech is obligate that's principle one principle two is that it codes a pattern of human behavior now rather than being a hunter gatherer i'm [2338](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2338.079s)

beating a box all day right and i'm branding and binding its nose and whatever else i have to do because it codes a pattern of human behavior it codes a pattern of values in human psyche and be than to do that in scale means it codes a culture and so animism was universal in south america north america africa europe [2359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2359.92s)

whatever it was pretty universal and animism died following the ox driven plow almost everywhere because you can't be animistic and be an animal all day long and so kind of some version of man men's dominion over type ideologies emerged following it and so to get that that piece of tech changed the [[value system|value systems]] from all life is sentient we're not the web of life we're merely a stranded at whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves two man's dominion over it's all here for us you know that kind of thing that was the result of a [[value system]] embedded in the technology itself inexorably embedded not based on how people used it but embedded in it and then some historians go on to argue that [2402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2402.72s)

not only did the plow do that regarding animism it also went from where previous to the plow societies and david graber's new book adds a lot of nuance i'm at i'm doing like a hundred thousand foot view but that whether women were gathering and men were hunting or women were doing horticulture and men were hunting women [2423](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2423.76s)

could still provide half the food stuffs men had to do the plow because women would miscarry men's upper body strength mattered so now men provided the meat stuff and the vegetative stuff women moved in the house as a result you also move from a distribution of male and female gods to mostly male gods so the thing that is called patriarchy oft is often attributed as a rising is a [2442](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2442.8s)

byproduct of the plow also and the movement from all the food that gives life being male derived rather than female because again of the physicality uh involved in the nature of the plow then of course that gives you surplus and before that you didn't have surplus so you have these you didn't have private property ownership you have these different kinds of sharing systems [2461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2461.04s)

now with much more surplus you could grow the population a lot faster now you've got larger than [[dunbar number]] kind of empires now you've got um radical wealth inequality and class systems so we're like are there arguments about why that ended up requiring more formal institutionalization of marriage on [2480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2480.24s)

larger scale because now i own stuff that i could pass on to my kids when i died so i wanted more paternity certainty so everything from like institutionalization of marriage to views towards animals to to patriarchy versus matriarchy to the formalization of economic to class systems all as possible second third order outputs not in the physical world but in [2498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2498.8s)

the cultural world of a piece of tech now we can go through similarly the way the [[printing press]] ended up giving rise to the protestant revolution and democracy and because without the [[printing press]] you can't have everybody have a newspaper and have books so only a nobility has access and we can go on and on and look at how each piece of tech if you use it in code's [[game theory|game theoretic]] power where those who use it will get ahead and those who don't will end up not making it through history so it's obligate it codes behavior as a result it codes values and minds as a result of doing that in scale it codes cultures so it's not just that we have to have values from something like religion or whatever to make us use tech well it's [2540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2540.8s)

the tech is directly creating our values also so we have to design tech that in mind not just how does this tech externalize costs in the physical world meaning um you know the mining byproduct and toxic tailings that come out of this mining technology and whatever but how it externalizes things into the human psychological cultural world we're [2564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2564.16s)

calling this kind of axiological design how do you embed the axiology the ethics into the tech design now we'll get into that's an example of how infrastructure drives [[superstructure]] and also [[social structure]] and nate talks a lot about how the [[social structure]] the economic growth the embedded economic growth obligation forces us to keep using more tech and [2585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2585.28s)

energy and keeps forcing more and more  up social [[superstructure|superstructures]] that justify doing that that are increasingly kind of nihilistic and etc so getting into how these interrelate is fascinating and it's probably beyond the scope of this because i want to get back to the nature of the [[superorganism]] but you do have to recognize the feedback [2608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2608.72s)

loops between all these in the [[superorganism]] so i just when you were mentioning people not caring about the complex life enough i'm actually wanting to give that example of ways that that actually resulted from the inexorabilities of the tech stack itself first of all that was beautiful [2627](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2627.52s)

uh in the first part of that where you were talking about the ox i actually got emotional i'd never heard that before and embedded in what you were just describing is the core innards of the [[superorganism]] and i asked you the wrong question before i [2645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2645.599s)

asked you if energy is values agnostic and what i should have asked you is surplus values agnostic because when we started that transition in agriculture it was to maximize the surplus of energy of course largely stored calories it was interesting i see agriculture as being the first not the first i see agriculture as being the second major [2671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2671.44s)

spike in our ability to extract energy from the environment i see fire being the first major spike in agriculture then oil and then digital technologies that increase our ability to do all of that faster and of course there's a million sub refinements so it is surplus and its [2689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2689.68s)

energy like they're both fair and just to look ahead uh and i don't know that i've said this on a podcast or in my life before but fire um agriculture oil and fossil hydrocarbons and info and tech those were the cans that we kept kicking to expand our our reach i don't think [2714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2714.64s)

physically we have any more cans to kick and the next can is in our minds it's in how we get our evolutionary neurotransmitter cocktails of meaning and love and excitement and motivation and peace by using less resources that's the only [2740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2740.0s)

can left to kick i think look at the jevins paradox way back to agriculture then we're going to move it forward so the jeven's paradox on oil and kind of fossil energy makes perfect sense which is when you get a increase in efficiency in the ability to make more oil or energy generation you're going to use [2759](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2759.599s)

more energy because it opened up new market sectors but you can see that was also true for agriculture right and basically the generation of human calories as you grow the population if you get an increase in efficiency where you can get a lot more calories per acre or you can convert more acres to cropland that increase in efficiency [2778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2778.079s)

means you get more surplus which means you grow your population faster and that thing keeps happening so there was a jeven's paradox way back then right and and a [[superorganism]] dynamic way back then too because if you didn't do that if you didn't clear the land uh someone else would have and out competed you so all of a sudden there [2798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2798.079s)

was this imperative that hadn't existed before so now do you want to go ahead and define the maximum power principle and then we can tie those three concepts together the maximum power principle is sometimes referred to as the fourth law of thermodynamics and it is defined as organisms and ecosystems self-organized so as to access an energy gradient [2819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2819.839s)

so um there's something also related called klieber's law which shows that the metabolism or the energy burning of a an animal or an insect or a whale or anything in nature is related to their size their body size to the two-thirds power so the maximum power principle shows [2846](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2846.16s)

that organisms in nature self-organize to get more access to energy but it's power right it's not just access to this pool of energy it's energy per unit time which is defined as power now in nature other species only access energy that they use endosomatically in their body humans use 2 000 calories a day in our body but in america we use 200 000 calories a day exosomatically outside of our body so we have a hundred to one exosomatic magic wand that we're waving around on average so maximum power principle just means there's a tether between uh animal behavior and access to energy let me um say it a different way that is a a corollary of that which gets to the [2906](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2906.16s)

obligate nature which you were just starting to speak to when i was saying before if you don't use the plow then your civilization is not going to make it through and define the [[world system]] relative to anybody else using it if you don't exploit the energy source that doesn't mean nobody's going to exploit the energy source somebody's going to exploit the energy source whoever exploits the energy source which includes the way that changes their culture and their means to be able to justify doing the thing that's the culture that's going to end up using that energy game theoretically and getting ahead which also means the means that correspond with that are the ones that get selected for right so we we did briefly mention in the first [2942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2942.88s)

conversation um alfred latka wrote a paper a hundred years ago that access to energy was a core driver of evolutionary success and that those animals that had access to energy had options that those who did not didn't have access to so access to energy was a core driver in our [2966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2966.64s)

evolutionary past and you're right an energy resource would not long remain untapped in the wild maps and evolutionary theory to um niche filling the concept of niche filling if there is any evolutionary niche that has some energy and in some critter is going to evolve to be able to access that energy now the thing with humans and as you point out the exosomatic capacity of [2987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=2987.2s)

humans is there's a lot there's a lot of environments that with our tech we can identify have energy in them that animals could not get the energy out of and um they couldn't do a lot to turn uranium or into energy and we can right they couldn't get a whole lot of the [3005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3005.839s)

energy out of fossil fuels and we can they couldn't deplete all of the topsoil to turn it into grains you know back to the earlier one they also couldn't control fire to be able to burn and cook things that were on unedible into cook you know edible things and or drive steam or whatever it was so [3020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3020.64s)

in evolution there is this kind of niche filling but with our [[tool making]] we're able to do that on crack like on the totally different version of that and but the maximum power principle okay there's a chunk i want to do can you give me like the minimum chunk size will take a bit to construct these things you you have as large a chunk as you need my friend so the jeven's paradox [3042](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3042.48s)

says uh you get more efficiency and rather than just use less stuff you use that increased efficiency to do more stuff that is now gives there's more things that ever return possibilities than you had before if you don't because you're like oh we can just live sufficiently now somebody else will [3060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3060.559s)

and in general that's the concept of a [[multipolar trap]] or a kind of can you give an example of the efficiency that you just said just something in our regular lives yeah um i mean i'll uh the example we gave of the plow is a perfect example a plow will allow one man using a plow to produce i don't know if [3084](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3084.96s)

it's 10 or 100 times more calories than a guy who's just hunting right because his ability over the course of a year to plant crops and you know grain crops that have and increasingly hybridize them the grain calorie per acre per year relative to hunting or horticulture is just  uncomparable so um that is an increase in efficiency so we could just say oh great now we just don't need to work as many hours and use less land and be able to feed ourselves and do more art and spirituality except we don't we're like great let's work all of the hours and grow our population um or you know build bigger surpluses to be able to create [3124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3124.96s)

systems of trade and exchange to be able to do increased division of labor and more total specialization and complexity of our society so that it can beat another one in war because we have better weapons so there's two things that are happening there one is all the 10 to 100 times extra surplus then has ripple effects in the economy [3144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3144.559s)

that then there's more surplus to do more things and the other thing is the the other guy who's still the hunter has a choice to make am i still gonna hunt and get this low caloric output or am i too gonna switch to this new technology the plow so our people he might think [3165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3165.28s)

only took uh what we absolutely needed to live in harmony and so we wouldn't kill the pregnant buffalo and we wouldn't kill the babies and we wouldn't kill when the buffalo were too low and they had had a hard season we actually decided to leave buffalo alone even though they were great and only on deer and because of this long-term [3183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3183.76s)

understanding of how to be part of a cycle of life but uh and when we took buffalo we took just kind of what we needed now if i don't kill the buffalo and these other guys have moved in who are just going to kill all the buffalo they can right and they don't practice that thing if i don't kill it [3200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3200.48s)

it doesn't mean that it stays alive anymore if i don't kill it it just means that they do and that they will grow their population and not only will they grow their population they'll now do division of labor make better weapons and then they'll come kill all of our people so me not killing it doesn't protect it [3216](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3216.16s)

anymore i have the ability to kill it but not the ability to protect it therefore i actually should race i know you're talking about buffalo and plows everything but you're talking about our modern up culture as well and how we are living in the [[superorganism]] and we can't help but be part of the [[superorganism]] even though we understand don't like it [3237](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3237.52s)

uh it's a compulsion so this is you know you and i've talked about this i'll go ahead and um formalize the concept because i want to bring the maximum power principle jeven's paradox the [[superorganism]] the inexorability all together to understand what this forcing function has been to understand how we make it not inexorable how do we [3255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3255.44s)

get out of it because the guy who doesn't want to kill the buffalo recognized if i just kind of finish that sentence so it's probably obvious to everybody if i don't kill the buffalo the buffalo doesn't still live the buffalo is going to get killed and  anyways these other guys then are going to kill our people with their increased capacity so not only [3273](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3273.68s)

am i going to leave the buffalo i have to hunt to kill it faster than the other guy to be able to grow our population in defense and whatever because now in the face of um you know in group out warfare of whatever kind i kind of have to do that so now there's a [[race to the bottom]] because if anybody does the up [3290](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3290.24s)

thing for the whole but that provides a lot of [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage for them in the near term and they're going to use that [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage in [[game theory|game theoretic]] ways then everybody has to race to do that thing faster or they lose in the midterm and they don't get to the long-term sustainable thing that they're trying to do we would call this a [[multipolar trap]] as the generalized case of it of which there are a few examples and they're the most intractable issues for society and i would argue this is one of the deeper frames to understand what humanity has to solve the [[multipolar trap]] one example is a tragedy of the commons and we were just giving an example of a tragedy of the commons it's also if i [3327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3327.359s)

don't cut the tree down the tree doesn't say somebody else cuts the tree down the forest is all going to get destroyed anyways but they're going to use that timber and the increased economic capacity to then also advance uh in a way that will our people you know whether it's direct warfare or [3344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3344.96s)

economic warfare or whatever so now we're in a race to cut the trees down the fastest or they're externalizing costs to the environment in the form of pollution or dumping or mining tailings or whatever it is if i don't do it it doesn't not happen they're going to do it anyways and then they're going to use that adaptive advantage too so this is a thing where the inexorability of it [3364](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3364.079s)

happening anyways means that we have to race to not be to have anything we care about be by other people doing it and of course everybody thinks that if i don't they will and acros so if you don't have the ability to make a system-wide agreement and enforce it then you get those kinds of [[race to the bottom]] so a tragedy of the commons is one example we can bind these on small scales where you can create some agreement process and some enforcement process but we need to have transparency of who violated the thing and then an enforcement we can actually enact and everybody agree on very large scales it's really hard which is why [[climate change]] is still a thing and which is why we have not got conservation of the oceans the atmosphere or any kind of thing well is because if we tax carbon and china doesn't and that messes up our gdp growth relative to theirs and there's a great power competition for who controls the 21st century then by us taxing carbon we're [3420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3420.64s)

still not preventing [[climate change]] we're just agreeing to uh seed power of the world to a different power system that may be for a lot of reasons we might not think is a good idea so unless everybody can nobody can that kind of thing so tragedy of the commons is one example a [[arms race]] is another if they build nukes we have to build nukes [3441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3441.2s)

because otherwise whoever doesn't have the nukes loses and nobody wants to give up the nukes because whoever gives up their last nuke first just is going to get everybody's kind of clear on that and i'm not going to give up my last nuke because i'm pretty sure that if they say they're giving up their last nuke they're lying how do i know that in some deep secret underground military [3456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3456.96s)

banker they bunker they don't have a nuke and so we're just not going to de-proliferate now it gets worse when you start to get very fast areas of new tech i don't i don't really want to live in a world with ai weapons but i have to build ai weapons and i'm basically representing any advanced nation-states thinking right now right we have to [3475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3475.04s)

build the ai weapons because they are so if china's going to build the ai weapons and the ai weapons are just obviously going to have supremacy then the u.s and russian india and everybody has to race to do them well why don't we just make an agreement that nobody does because we can't ensure that people are keeping the agreements because what are they doing in some deep underground military base [3491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3491.68s)

as a result we need to not either make the agreement and we defect on it knowing they're defecting while pretending that we aren't defecting spying on them and trying to lie to their spies and that's kind of the thing happens or we just don't even bother making the agreement and then we're in a all-out race to [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3507.04s)

build the most up stuff that increases everybody's likelihood of dying from ai weapons now add this to bio weapons and on and on and on so the [[arms race]] and the tragedy of the commons are two there's a third one which is in the market the kind of first mover advantage race to first move on a market or race to scale on a market that then externalizes [3530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3530.48s)

everything other than the possible win potential so there is a perverse [[game theory]] on paying attention to opportunity versus paying attention to risk uh if i am going to develop some new technology like let's say some advanced genetic engineering technology like crispr of [3548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3548.4s)

course there are some positive applications like maybe i can try to do immuno oncology and crispr gene oncogenes out and whatever but of course as i'm developing the capacity to do that cheaply anybody can use it for any purpose like bio weapons or make more cancer right and so one of the tricky things that happens [3566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3566.16s)

in the world today is somebody develops a technology in major corporation or say in academia right they have an ethical review board if it's in academia to ensure they're doing some ethical purpose and there's oversight and there's all like that but then they're [3582](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3582.64s)

developing the techniques and then they publish it and they're publishing something that unlike nukes is not hard to build physically right i don't have to have cyclotrons and uranium enrichment it's just now like pretty simple technologically to make the ai thing or the or the synth bio thing or whatever so [3597](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3597.76s)

i have an ethical purpose to develop the thing but the knowledge by which i just developed and that i published and that i used to huge mit funds or the stanford funds or whatever it is now anybody without those funds and ethical review boards has access to build that same thing for other purposes and even if i'm going to go to market applications i say no no my market [3618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3618.16s)

application is good i'm using it to do this thing well there's externalities that it might cause directly plus other people using that tech for up purposes but if i think about that if i think about the rest and say oh you know what before we move forward on this i'm really going to do a complex risk assessment of all the second and third order effects of what this might do [3636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3636.4s)

directly plus what putting the information out might enable others to do and then we're not if it's bad we're not going to do it and if it's bad but we find a way to mitigate it then we'll do the mitigate version so let's say i do that somebody else in the market doesn't do that they're just like it there's an [3651](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3651.359s)

opportunity i'm just going to sell the story that this opportunity is awesome there's no downside risk we did risk mitigation but it was a total kind of version they win the first mover advantage they get all the dollars they have socialized the risk to the world they have privatized the game to themselves [3668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3668.48s)

and as a result the [[game theory]] and sense being focused on the opportunity and not the risk whoever focuses on the risk just loses and has no power um so all of these the market race which ends up being a [[race to the bottom]] externality-wise the [[arms race]] the tragedy of the commons or examples of [[multipolar trap]] where anybody doing the thing that is up for the whole in [3692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3692.319s)

the long term but provides [[game theory|game theoretic]] advantage to them in the near term ends up causing races in the wrong direction humanity has to solve for that thing categorically there are ways i believe of solving for categorically and we can talk about what some of those are and there are examples of where we've done it on local scales [3707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3707.359s)

we just haven't solved for it categorically now this is directly related to the dynamics of the [[superorganism]] with it you talk about it it's directly related to the obligate nature of the plow right it's directly related to the maximum power principle so i just wanted to construct a [[multipolar trap]] we'll come back to that but you wanted to say something yeah well so what you're saying is the hunter versus the guy with the plow and the obligate nature and the uh jevon's paradox rebound effect from the surplus generated by the plow i've been writing about how that applies to our [[economic system]] and uh money and energy and co2 absorption by the biosphere in the oceans but you're adding another layer [3755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3755.839s)

to it which is saying the same dynamic applies to technology especially exponentially soon to be ai informed technology and spins off all these other mini [[superorganism]] volcanoes with x-risks attached to them because we're optimizing for opportunities not risk we define there there's a reason why it is intrinsically easier too and this is [3783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3783.92s)

worth noting there's a reason why it's intrinsically cognitively easier let alone game theoretically easier pragmatically easier i'm going to build tech to solve a problem i'm going to have already defined that problem in a pretty specific way and i'll have one or a small number of metrics that are the success the the success metric of the [3803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3803.52s)

opportunity right the problem solve or the opportunity so the plow is going to increase the calories uh of surplus that i can generate per person per year right like that's the metric of success it's pretty straightforward and i can measure the plow versus the digging stick i can measure one plow versus another later i can measure a [3823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3823.599s)

tractor versus a plow and what i'm trying to optimize for is how much total caloric surplus can be created per person or per acre or whatever it is right so the opportunity is measured in or the upside is measured in one or a small number of known metrics the risk is going to happen and it's a first order effect i'm [3844](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3844.72s)

directly causing that the tech is built to do a first order effect on one or a small number of known metrics the tech is going to have second and third and fourth order effects on a very large number of as of yet unknown metrics was where the harm is going to occur so to do the risk reduction to prevent the externalities i've got to think [3863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3863.119s)

about not just what the result of using the plow to get calories out but using that every season on top soil erosion and what top soil erosion then we'll do as a next order effect on the rivers because the roots aren't there anymore and what that'll do on the fisheries and what it does to human minds and what that will be so now the externalities might be a million metrics [3884](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3884.0s)

with nth order effects so it is easier it's intrinsically easier to optimize for opportunity than it is to prevent against the risks well we well we don't have the surplus to do the research even to optimize for all those risks there are so many people right now that are concerned about global insects population the estimate [3905](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3905.359s)

is we're losing one to two percent of insect biomass per year how the hell do we test that we can test little 10 acre plots here we don't have the resources because that's not in our [[economic system]] it's not that we don't have the resources it's the [[multipolar trap]] doesn't orient those resources that way well that that's my question is how can all of the tech that is currently being [3929](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3929.28s)

built is in order to amass digital representations of surplus and then this ties back to maximum power principle and evolution and ecology is that energy is going to be used and and in nature so where is this uh opportunity here that we are just naturally drawing down earth's energy [3954](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3954.64s)

battery 10 million times faster than it was sequestered because we found it how could we not optimize for energy surplus which is our biological tendency okay is that where you're going with with the what to do in the governance i have to get back to why we use all these ex somatic calories and other animals don't to get into the nature of the biological tendency of [3979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3979.359s)

humans it is distinct but i wanted to find the maximum power principle regarding markets um in a pure market system obviously we don't have pure market systems there's regulation but let me just kind of try to define the idea of in this close to pure market um type thing as we can think about [3999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=3999.039s)

uh so outside of regulation and enforcement music uh return on investment of capital will be any area that provides return of investment will be exploited there is a search function and an exploit function and the market will search anywhere that capital can turn [4021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4021.839s)

into more capital it will preference the higher returns but there will still be um some appetite for returns of any kind and so if i get positive returns i'm they're going to be exploited and so uh and we can say that in terms of capital but we can say in terms of energy too and to find the maximum power [4041](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4041.76s)

principle is wherever there are positive energy return on energy investment so even if we start getting down to that it takes most of a barrel of oil to get a new barrel of oil so long as it's i still get net oil out of the process we're gonna keep doing that thing if it is simply based on incentives right because because of oil is so special yes [4062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4062.559s)

but we wouldn't do the same for like corn ethanol from an energy perspective obviously uh it takes some energy to get new energy so long as i'm getting more energy out than the energy i'm putting in it makes sense to do it i'll always seek the maximum energy return on energy investment but as the maximum decreases [4081](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4081.599s)

i'll continue to do anything that gives me some energy return energy investment and that's also true with fiscal return on fiscal investment and from a [[game theory]] point of view any player any agent in a [[game theory|game theoretic]] situation is going to try to maximize their returns on agency i'm going to try to implement my capacity to act to get [4102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4102.799s)

more capacity to act music so that's your optionality in a way and it's actually very interesting one of the other papers we're writing right now consensus project is on a theory of hyper agents and the idea that of throughout history it's pretty obvious [4123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4123.44s)

that genghis khan's and alexander the greats are different than most people right like they're there's something in their motivational structure their psyche their capacities it's pretty different than most people and they have a outsized influence on what happens to the world and eight percent of men alive today have genghis khan [4141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4141.359s)

number is it's a very interesting yeah something in that neighborhood where we try to look at the patterns of what's happening in the world from a sociological perspective from patterns of kind of human psyche and behavior in general we would kind of argue that there is a tiny percentage of people at the top of [4163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4163.04s)

the power law distribution who have a outsized effect on the world and specifically then they create the topologies that everybody else operates in they create the incentive deter landscapes and cultures and stuff that then ends up making everybody else's values a lot what they are and these people are outside of the bell curves on most of the psychological [4183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4183.359s)

things that we assess sociologically as humans they are better at [[game theory]] better at war generally more sociopathic highly more competitive you know those types of things and one good way to think of it is that they are good at maximizing returns on agency and so the hyper agent is someone who [4204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4204.08s)

will implement agency to grow more agency and a good hyper agent is someone who figures out how to do that at maximum scale but are those people is it is it exactly the same people that are the richest people on the planet or not necessarily a major unit of agency it's not the only one [4222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4222.159s)

so kissinger had way more global influence than he had personal money there was massive pools of money that he had indirect influence over so how much money do i personally own versus how much do i have in assets under management versus how much do i have in assets under indirect influence versus you know like so um obviously like how much does how much money does xi jinping have personally versus stewarding the gdp of china it's not how much he has personally it's how much it's how much total agency he has influence over and there are different strategies for how to do that so those people are optimizing they're optimizing agency and [4261](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4261.44s)

optionality and the money that they amass is kind of an externality of that money is a unit of agency and optionality it's not the only unit but it's a particularly interesting and important one and it's why like obviously before we had a financial system with a global reserve fiat currency type thing the system emerged towards [4282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4282.56s)

towards better and better optionality right the financial system emerged towards that so when we were just talking about agriculture the unit of currency might largely be just grains right and being able to exchange grain for shoes or whatever it is or then we might just start getting into seashells or at a certain point [4302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4302.96s)

gold coins or something that is some kind of represent representation to mediate it a little bit easier and then the movement from some kind of mediated barter with local currencies to being able to change the gold to paper units that are easier to then be able to get rid of the gold to then be able to have a global reserve currency to you know what that gives is increased and if you look at the current system with a global reserve currency with kind of the opec backing uh petrodollar back and whatever you have the system of relatively high stability with maximum optionality and it's usually hard to get [4343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4343.679s)

both of those things that are very stable like the value of real estate or whatever is very low optional it takes me a long time to sell it and the things that can move very fast oftentimes if i didn't have a global financial system made to do this wouldn't have the same kind of stability so the system was kind of engineered to maximize total market movement right and so if you think about i think you and i talked about last time the military concept of ooda loop ooda observe what's going on orient to that to make sense of what to do decide and then act and that the the fastest and most accurate ooda loop ends up winning in [[game theory|game theoretic]] scenarios some kind of in a situation where the world is changing rapidly long-term planning is not as good as very fast ability to adapt and figure out what to do and so if i have a bunch of land and then all of a sudden the world changes where i need energy or steel or computation or a military my ability to convert that land [4403](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4403.92s)

to those things takes a while i got to sell that asset and find a way to sell it and so if i have a lot of currency my currency gives me maximum speed right maximum optionality to get gives you more options and so everybody wants the most is the thing that has absolutely no intrinsic value but the maximum optionality for every [4425](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4425.04s)

source of value and yeah of course there's this perverse thing that it says we will destroy sources of real value to get the optionality value because i want to have more options than the next and there's a [[multipolar trap]] right because if i don't maximize my returns on agency because i value things so i'm going to put money into protecting the forest and not turning the forest into lumber and then into capital um if i don't maximize my returns on agency and someone else does they're going to end up either beating me in war or influencing the world more than me so there's a [[multipolar trap]] between hyper agents to maximize returns on agency and there's a rationalization that even if it's because i think i'm the most ethical hyper agent i would be the best ruler whatever it is i am still obligated to get the maximum power to be able to do that in what is considered a obligate game so how many hyper agents are there on the planet people who want to do maximum returns on agency there's plenty of people who are very power oriented they just aren't equally good at it so there's plenty of people who are trying to climb the corporate ladder and they're in middle management and they are hyper agents in their motivational complex it's just how [4497](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4497.92s)

good at it they are is not that much there's individual thugs who have nobody working under them who are trying to maximize their agency so they might be a hyper agent motivationally but their skill to do it is relatively low so if we're talking about a tier one hyper agent the the [4513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4513.76s)

highest capacity ones they're not just motivated to do returns on agency they know how to do it at scale which requires being able to understand how to navigate things like finance politics technology culture human motivation you know how the things that can extend my agency in scaling dynamics and depending upon how we define tier one there's not that many so contrast that to the [[superorganism]] you have this small group of hyper agents that are maximizing optionality tethered to digital representations dollars linked to energy and they're competing with each other for more agency [4563](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4563.199s)

is that the driver of the [[superorganism]] or is the [[superorganism]] driving them you're asking a bottom-up top-down causation question in a system that is recursive and so there's a bottom-up dynamic which is individual people are motivated to do stuff but then that creates larger systems and at this point now global systems that then have their own embedded dynamics right like the [[embedded growth obligation]] on capital is not any particular hyper agent it's the it's a global financial system that because of interest if nothing else and there's a lot more on [4602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4602.08s)

top of that but simply because of that structure has to have an [[exponential growth]] curve and to stay bound to goods and services means you have to have an [[exponential growth]] of the [[materials economy]] blah blah but the that system creates a top-down influence on all of the agents to do the bidding of that [4619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4619.679s)

system and so you know you produce the rather than people produce goods and services and then we figure out some way to index and make an amount of currency as you mentioned making up the money out of the not thin air but the contract is basically saying let's put up put up the money to incent the growth of goods and services to keep up with it so it [4638](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4638.56s)

doesn't debase itself but if you think about the money incentive system okay so if i get money i get the optionality for anything i want that's pretty cool that means that rather than have to figure out what somebody wants you just get to give them this unit of choice making right and the money is just kind of like a unit of choice making whatever the you want so now [4657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4657.44s)

everybody wants the unit of choice making and the incentive of the decentralized system is for everybody to figure out how to do the best job at converting their own uh life force both labor and creativity into currency right that's the mo that's the kind of market motivation [4679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4679.12s)

and so it's my labor energy will get me a little bit not all that much my creativity multiplied by that might get me a whole lot more um and so there is a both search algorithm which is all the humans in the world which was a smaller amount before but eight billion [4698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4698.48s)

humans incentivized to figure out new and better ways to make stuff that will correlate to capital and then to exploit the out of doing that and as soon as somebody figures out a new a new thing that people hadn't figured out now there is a [4713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4713.12s)

race for others to try to exploit that space maximally once you get so somebody figures out early computation or whatever it is now then everybody starts to race on that thing once that space gets flooded enough it creates more incentive for search on new things when somebody figures it out and there's a race on that thing i don't have a lot of money [4730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4730.32s)

um i would like more money but i'm not driven by it i'm driven by discovery and friendship and conversations like this and doing meaningful things and so i'm optimizing for a broader portfolio of results than the optionality for money having said that i would dearly like more money in the bank [4752](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4752.96s)

for a rainy day in case i get sick or something happens or i don't get funding uh you know etc but there is the capacity for humans to optimize things other than the a single monetary representation of all our ancestral experience the scientists philosophers artists spiritual teachers throughout history [4778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4778.719s)

that we liked the most were mostly motivated like you said there was an intrinsic motivation that was not that much of an extrinsic motivation like original theory of money partly was how do we mediate barter partly was how do we incentivize people to do a bunch of shitty labor jobs that society needs that nobody's intrinsically motivated to [4797](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4797.679s)

do so we need to extrinsically motivate them to do it because that is ultimately more efficient and kinder than the state forcing them to do it the state could just take care of everybody's needs and then force them to do it but we'll let the market force them instead of the state and so that one of the core ideas of money was a system of extrinsic incentive [4813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4813.84s)

because there's a bunch of that needs to get done that nobody really wants to do but then of course some people then take that extrinsic incentive and figure out how to just get very good at getting lots of it not doing the labor stuff right um so interestingly was einstein money motivated it does not [4832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4832.4s)

seem so seems like he was very intrinsically motivated to figure out the universe as deeply as he could um was that game theoretically not just money but agency game theoretically motivated at all pretty much seems like a genuine curiosity uh sacred even kind of impulse [4851](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4851.84s)

now did his scientific insights give the basis for how to make the nuclear bomb totally it was that his intention though was the development of the ball motivated by [[game theory]] totally and it couldn't have done that without him doing that thing so then the [[game theory]] ends up exploiting the non-[[game theory]] things one could argue that jesus didn't make a lot of christians constantine made a lot of christians and i take this argument uh for the spirit of it rather than the literality because i don't know the historicity of i don't know if anybody [4893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4893.679s)

knows the historicity of any of this well enough but kind of standard narrative between jesus and the third century there were just not that many christians and small amount of christians you know getting thrown to lions and roman empires like that then we get a huge number of christians when the roman empire goes from throwing christians to alliance [4912](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4912.639s)

being the holy roman empire and the crusades and spreading christendom and so the council of isaiah the creation of the bible the idea of spreading it by force or crusades that wasn't jesus right and so it's not who made the concept it's who identified a utility of it and mo it was motivated to make it spread that was a hyper agent and so [4931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4931.92s)

um so i would say jesus and einstein were both motivated by non-hyper hyper agency oriented things and then constantine and eisenhower or eisenhower and in that case you know hitler whatever we're motivated to see how do we extract that and convert it to [[game theory]] so we need wider boundary hyper agents [4952](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4952.08s)

but the system doesn't reward that and most wider boundary hyper agents have very little power optionality hyper agent is um is getting returns on agency right they're they're i wanna when i was a kid and my mom was taking me to do activist stuff we were going to greenpeace [4979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=4979.92s)

protests and peta and calpers and all these kinds of things and i really cared and but i saw that everybody there really really cared they were willing to self-sacrifice for other sentient beings they had never met whether it was an animal in a [[factory farm]] or a whale that would get hurt or uh whatever and i remember seeing that and then thinking about the industries they were up against and the tools of capital advantage and political advantage and technological and intellectual advantage that those industries had relative to the tools of effectiveness these people [5015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5015.44s)

were using was handcuffing themselves to things and you know picket signs and like that it was just so clear they were going to keep losing and the way i saw it at first was that that represented the kind of head heart divide at the level of humanity and that those things can't actually be divided and then i realized one more [5035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5035.44s)

step i started thinking of it as like um head heart will you know um something like that that the those three one there's of course lots of types of intelligence lots of types of capacity we need to think about them all together um but if you just take those three as a beginning kind of model and you kind of say okay solar plexus [5059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5059.679s)

will agency heart kind of values uh and mine kind of strategic technological insight and i started to see that any two out of the three together in the world dies because if you it's not just single ones die if you end up having a lot of agency and a lot of heart a wide kind of heart [5080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5080.32s)

rate which is ori oriented to care about a lot of things inclusively well the activists had that right the activists had high agency they were willing to work their asses off risk themselves get on zamboni's handcuff themselves things so a lot of agency a lot of heart very poor strategic thinking about how to actually so they had agency but they didn't have [5101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5101.76s)

the strategy to do hyperagency and so they would continue to lose if you had kind of wide inclusive values and you were smart but you didn't have a huge amount of agency i saw so many like caring liberal intellectuals who had some thought about the problems in the world they really cared and they felt crushed and like they couldn't do anything if you didn't have wide values you had narrow values but you had very high agency and you had high strategic thinking and your strategic thinking was in service of your agency and your values were only optimizing for yourself or your corporation or your [[nation state]] and you were willing to externalize harm elsewhere you became a awesome hyper agent they ruled the world while [5142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5142.32s)

externalizing lots of harm and creating multiple traps with other hyper agents to do so so um how to get all three of those together right which would be the the will and strategic capacity but with the wide inclusive values i'm not trying to [5159](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5159.12s)

optimize for a narrow set of metrics but very wide inclusive of everything i would say that is a minimum necessary requirement for people that can help turn the ship around now that doesn't end the [[multipolar trap]] that whatever values i care about that don't optimize my agency still seem like the game theoretically lose if i care about them to the people that only do [5179](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5179.44s)

the agency returns and so one of the things that we have to get into is how to make that not lose and that's one of the criteria of turning the [[superorganism]] thing around i think there are answers to that and it's probably in our next podcast well i was going to say i mean you and i know some of these hyper agents and is one of the possibilities to change [5200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5200.239s)

the values in this group to be wider or wider values as you were saying is that possible i mean the question of do you try to increase the understanding of interconnectedness and the embodied values and commitments of the hyperagents do you try to increase the agency of the people who [5224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5224.96s)

already have wider and deeper values you know any of those are possible paths they're all hard human development is a is not a quick thing um and more fundamentally we want to ask the question like when we were mentioning the way plows affected values at scale [5244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5244.56s)

um it is not just what do we try to do with individual people but how would we make changes to society that would be developing people differently at scale now of course you have this bootload question of like well who's going to do that who is going to do that that was in this current system that isn't doing that to try to make systems that you know [5264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5264.48s)

incentivize different things long term i think we are approaching a bend versus break moment and we discussed that in the first conversation where our financial claims on our physical reality are diverging and that gap is getting wider and it's unsustainable so when we have our third conversation [5286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5286.32s)

i would like to horizontally look at triage transition and long-term solutions for the human enterprise and then vertically globally nationally in communities and as individuals you have off the record and tangential to this conversation given me some excellent personal advice [5311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5311.36s)

on how to cope and and thrive during this time i don't know if we want to fit that in the next macro podcast but you're you're very good at that stuff so that's where i want to head to on the what to do because learning about the [[superorganism]] actually does something [5333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5333.04s)

paradoxical when you understand it it actually makes you at least feel like you have less agency people that understand the the momentum of all this it's kind of a shitty thing to discover because it feels like oh we can't just pass a climate uh law and everything is fixed or oh we just can't have um you know a law that is more equality and [5358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5358.639s)

that doesn't fix things that the problem is much more systemic and deeper than that it is certainly often the case that as people understand that the individual problems are not so easily solvable on their own they're part of a deeper set of interconnected things and there's this kind of really tricky [[game theory]] of multiple traps and incentives on opportunity and not risk and and that even if you try to regulate a thing that the regulatory apparatus moves slower than the thing trying to regulate and so it continues to wiggle out of the regulations and as people start to understand all that it can make them feel less agency and a little bit overwhelmed and shitty and so [5402](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5402.159s)

as you mentioned talking about how to emotionally psychologically hold that's valuable but it doesn't have to make them feel less agency um it can make them feel more agency and that's actually what i hope happens so that's the effect as for me and i'll explain why inside of me because i think it can for a lot of people if they hold [5424](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5424.0s)

it this way i think there's a lot of people who music care but the problems seem intractable there's a certain kind of nihilism they have because [[climate change]] seems like such a huge deal and and almost impossible to solve and then [5443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5443.12s)

so does [[species extinction]] and so does nuclear risk and so does and it seems like there's a million problems and then they learn about a new one and a new one and even if they started to feel like they got hope around some chunk of them there's more and there's a certain sense of like impossibility in trying to deal with it all of that level that when you start to [5463](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5463.76s)

get oh there are underlying system dynamics that all these are expressions of it can start to feel more tractable those problems are hard but now that we're able to actually articulate that all the other problems are expressions of a set of system dynamics now we at least know where to focus now possibly we've defined the problem well [5481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5481.92s)

enough to be able to solve it and in understanding a problem better more solutions start to emerge if i don't understand the problem well enough i probably can't solve it at all as i'm understanding it better i might say wow that's a hard problem but at least possible so i think we move from impossible to hard when we start to understand it better and heart is better than impossible and what i want is that it actually kind of cures the nihilism people have running of maybe this is impossible and creates a inspiration and upregulation with regard to the heart of like hard but possibly tractable this should get all my life energy the fact that i don't know the answer instantly [5520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5520.639s)

nobody knows einstein didn't know the answer to the questions he was asking and no inventor knew the answer how to make the invention they were thinking of there is some faith that the thing that you don't know exists that makes you do hard discovery work and stay with it one of the other problems you talk about kind of the dopaminergic [5538](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5538.48s)

nature of the [[superorganism]] is that the delayed gratification to work on a problem for a long time that you don't know how to solve instantly is  critical and so one of the attributes of the people in addition to these three things you know together the kind of agency heart mind is part of the agency is the capacity to say i don't know the answer but that doesn't mean i'm demotivated the fact that i can even start to wrap my head around the problem more means that there is a possible path to answer and i'm motivated to continue to explore that space until i have it and then implement the best answers i have and then when they fail find out why they [5576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5576.639s)

failed and not feel it take it as a failure but learning so that psychology i would say is critical to being part of solution thank you that is uh helpful and it makes sense to me um one of my biggest challenges is all along um i'm an expert on describing the [5595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5595.44s)

constraints uh of our situation less so of an expert on the solutions uh because they're not impossible but they're hard as you said but i spend most of my time debunking people that say no we can decouple energy from gdp and uh no renewables we'll be able to power a 19 terawatt society we just [5620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5620.08s)

need to have the political will or or whatever i spend most of my time on that instead of in the solution space because as you say we have to understand the systemic nature of the problem in order to work on the real solutions one of the reasons you have the podcast is to help more people understand the design criteria and the reason you're [5641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5641.36s)

motivated to do that is not because you just like attention being on a podcast but because more people understanding the criteria leads to more people's creativity working on solutions and so there is an implicit faith in your strategy we need a lot more people [[collective intelligence]] if it has the right input can do something right obviously that's [5660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5660.4s)

why i'm talking with you here is the same kind of faith the we're actually working on uh a project right now um on what are the kind of very hard questions that are underneath most of the problems that we think are a better orienting framework [5680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5680.239s)

than things like sustainable development goals and the multi how do you solve multiple traps is an example of one of those questions and being able to make that very widely understood not to bum everyone out but to say let's get the decentralized [[collective intelligence]] of the world having the best frameworks for understanding [5696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5696.8s)

the most fundamental problems as the center of the innovative focus of the creativity of the world right if we have uh people understand those constraints widely of course some people say i don't know what the to do with that but a lot of people be like oh this is an engineering problem let's start to work on it and some of the problems like how [5712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5712.96s)

do you solve multiple or traps don't have a single solution they'll have lots of partial solutions well in order to get enforcement you have to be able to see so there's going to be transparency tax so how do we create force transparency in some places and how do we create incentives on transparency and how do we and other things will have to do with enforcement others love doing [5728](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5728.96s)

incentive others will have to do a better regulatory process um and then of course whenever you figure out a thing it'll be gamed because there will be still be an incentive to gain it so it's and that's why it's not here is the answer forever it's why it's an orienting question how do we continue to [5744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5744.48s)

pay attention to things like [[perverse incentive|perverse incentives]] and externalities and [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and do a better job ongoingly and procedurally up regulating our responses to these things that are fundamental to all the other problems and if and if people like you are not articulating the design criteria well then other people be coming up with [5764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5764.08s)

solutions really well intendedly they were just missing some of the line criteria and this is one of the problems is as we were mentioning we define the problems with narrow definitions of what success means that still externalize lots of harm or miss some of the constraints getting the constraint set better might make it harder but actually it [5780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5780.32s)

makes it possible whereas before it was impossible because all the things were bound to fail because they didn't understand what the success required so rather than go from easy to hard the easy was for sure going to fail so it wasn't easy was impossible we're actually going from impossible to hard which is a movement in the right direction okay so you wanted to unpack a little bit more about atoms bits jewels and and maybe dollars and and human behavior so yeah just to kind of underscore the energy blindness that you talk about um i think the first time i heard the term atoms and bits together in terms of describing the economy was from peter thiel and of course makes sense that [5822](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5822.08s)

from someone who made money in silicon valley in the domain of bits recognizing uh that there is still stuff to do in the domain of adams which is what peter's very favorable of which is why he likes elon and you know people who build [[physical tech|physical technologies]] um for the people coming out of silicon valley where everything was about digital tech and obviously digital tech kind of subsumed so much of the world in particular the financial world's attention because of the capacity for the scaling dynamics right the the [[network dynamics]] the metcalfe law that gives you kind of natural monopolies and the speed at which you can get three billion users into a platform which is so unheard of for anything else like that and the speed at which you can get to a billion dollar valuation or anything else because of uh the bits give you exponential returns [5877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5877.76s)

right the i can make a piece of software once and then sell it in a definite number period a number of times and that obviously started with computation software then when i get a beyond just software and that would be like the microsoft story into something that is a network so it's software but then it's applied to mediating human interaction where the value occurs across the [5898](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5898.239s)

interaction so the number of people that goes up the value squares as something like a second power to that which would be true for digital currencies amazon facebook all those types of things um now you're dealing with something like you know uh an [[exponential curve]] with another exponential or at least polynomial curve on top of it and so the of of course from a financial point of view money into software equals more money out relative to most other things and so you know that sucked up a lot of the world's attention but then you know people recognize there's still stuff to [5937](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5937.119s)

do in the domain of atoms that matters but even calling it atoms and bits of course these guys are very sophisticated i've heard peter thiel refer to it that way or biology of course they know that the energy sector is one of the biggest sectors they get pitched at species all the time on new energy tech they know saudi aramco as you know maybe the biggest or one of the [5955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5955.199s)

biggest evaluation companies in the world and yet just even in the framing it's not impo it's not explicit in the framing and um the first time i heard the three together atoms energy and bits as the key parts of [[materials economy]] was from 4s landry [5971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5971.04s)

and that obviously doesn't still include all the human aspects but from a [[materials economy]] point of view kind of reducing it to the things that have fundamentally different physics it's a good structure the atoms we don't really get more of right the amount of copper we have on the [5987](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=5987.04s)

planet is what it is outside of mining asteroids we're not going to get more and even then it's still within a larger space of earth plus the asteroid belt or whatever that we're looking at and we also don't get rid of them so we have a finite amount and then we turn them into pollution if we don't go closed loop on them and so we have we have to go close loop on the atomic accounting of things right energy we're getting more of all the time but we have a kind of fixed bandwidth of how much comes in and we have to work within that bandwidth how many joules are coming into the planet from the sun per day and like that bits there is not the same fundamental limit of either a fixed amount that we [6023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6023.679s)

have to work with or a fixed input so they have a different scarcity dynamic it's really only limited by the energy and atoms needed for the computational substrate but then also limited by human time the attention seconds thing of how much software is useful if it requires either an interface the the software is either going to move [6045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6045.76s)

atoms around so you have to couple it to atoms it's going to move bits around in ways that take energy and the the software is it's going to require energy so it's coupled to that and or it's coupled to uh you know entertainment or some kind of human engagement directly so it's coupled to finite amounts of attention so you don't get an infinite scaling on [6064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6064.8s)

the value of bits that is decoupled from human attention atoms and energy well there's also a qualitative aspect to the bits too based on what culture cares about one thing i would say on the atom's energy bits so the first thing is of course atoms aren't that useful unless we can rearrange them and move them around and [6085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6085.119s)

that takes energy and energy is not useful if we aren't moving atoms or bits around with it or moving it through things made of atoms right so uh we care about it to have a motor that moves an atom around or something like that and bits are going to be coding for [6103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6103.36s)

the thing that we're going to you know the digital pattern that we're actually going to build in the physical world or something that is related to and at minimum running on a computational substrate energy and atoms so there are coupling coefficients between them where you don't get to just increase bits indefinitely independent of atoms [6126](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6126.88s)

and energy you can increase them to some extent and those where you'll get increases in efficiency but then that's why the germans paradox still matters is what happens with those increases in efficiency so those increases in efficiency have to not jeven's paradox which means we need a binding dynamic because the pure market dynamic will just turn that into a maximum power [6143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6143.36s)

principle and forever growth those increases in efficiency have to also turn into less total utilization to deal with actual limits of growth and you're not going to get that through a pure incentive system you need that through a binding system that'll get into what we talk about later of how do you make governance in the presence of [6160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6160.4s)

international [[multipolar trap|multipolar traps]] and the fact that markets typically capture the regulatory system rather than the other way around so how do energy well joules bits and atoms well the first thing i want to say is there's something like a paradox on all of them and [6180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6180.48s)

jeven's paradox was obviously named that looking at energy but it's because energy is a relevant input to any kind of industrial process any kind of you know market process so when energy gets cheaper more total market space opens up well compute has become useful to pretty much every market right so when compute becomes cheaper we use more total [6201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6201.52s)

compute that's a that's another kind of jeven's paradox on computation and we don't say great now we'll compute with less energy we say great now there's more total that we can apply computation to um but it would also be true to say anything that is uh industrial input that is useful not [6220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6220.4s)

in one industry but widely when it becomes cheaper will increase total market so if if we can extract steel more cheaply and steel is key to our ability to build vertically and you know pop high population spaces as that gets cheaper we will build more  grow populations more and grow net markets more so what i would say is there is this generalized jeven's [6244](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6244.08s)

paradox that when anything that is relevant for the market as a whole gets cheaper the market as a whole grows and so you have that kind of boomerang on efficiency not just on energy but kind of writ large and that's an important part of understanding maximum power principle i agree with that uh though i think the opposite is about [6267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6267.199s)

to start happening that we've gotten a clue with ukraine and russia and europe's dependence on russian hydrocarbons that as energy gets more expensive everything in society is going to get more expensive including solar panels and wind turbines you know the last three months etc so as we've been focusing on the powers of what technology can provide for us during that era that narrative was supported by pretty much every year we grew our access to fossil energy and most of the time it was very cheap but there's a multiplier effect that we add thousands to ten thousands of units of [6314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6314.4s)

fossil energy to replace tasks that the ox or uh my great great great great grandfather did in the fields uh and so that because of that our industrial processes our bits and atoms are incredibly sensitive to price increases in energy at 200 a barrel energy oil is still effectively magic for what it can do for us but many of the energy-intensive processes in the world would become unprofitable the entire market depends upon pricing you talk about pricing the cost of energy the cost of extraction rather than what it would actually take for us to make that substrate [6362](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6362.719s)

and and the total externality cost this is also another kind of corollary of the kind of market dynamics and maximum power principles is not just the cost of energy but the cost of steel the cost of anything is going to be the cost of extraction and then some margin right so it's going to cost us something and this is kind of that return on investment topic it's going to cost us something to get out of the earth but we didn't make it there and there's going to be you know a lot of cost that is externalized not to our balance sheet in terms of we just destroyed rivers and extincted some species and ruined some indigenous um people's lives and [6398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6398.56s)

uh you know whatever but um music and we we just can't make we just can't make hydrocarbons at scale like that that have that organic chemistry complexity and so um but if anyone just extracts it because if there isn't a law we call it being industrious to extract we there isn't a law saying stealing from the balance sheet of nature because nature doesn't have a balance sheet is anything other than being industrious then i just have to have enough margin to sell it and i don't want too much margin because somebody else will do it and come with a [6431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6431.6s)

lower margin so the market will end up setting the price right so the market incentivizes extraction and and so what that means is a sustainable market because you can't keep extracting and externalizing and using unrenewable resources forever a sustainable market almost everything would not that we [6453](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6453.44s)

currently have would not be viable like almost nothing would be profitable and the profitability dynamics if we weren't externalizing all of the costs and burning through unrenewable things unrenewably would be completely different and this is the thing you're underscoring it's like what would that actually look like if we made sure that [6471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6471.04s)

we actually had we were using energy in ways that we could continue to use energy and we were using atoms in ways that we could continue to use atoms what would that system look like and it looks fundamentally different i think this is what's so fundamental in your work is saying hey we have to really rethink what does it mean to have a system that [6489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6489.119s)

you're not continuously subsidizing is we're about to lose our ability to keep subsidizing this thing i totally agree a slight clarification we actually can make low carbon hydrocarbon fuel with technology we can overbuild solar panels and wind turbines near bodies of water via hydrolysis we can create [6509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6509.76s)

methane which is basically natural gas but the all-in cost of that is ten dollars a gallon oil equivalent which would be we could have a viable society around that but not this society not not this amount of goods and services and complexity um and we can talk about that on our next conversation [6536](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6536.719s)

the plan is to continue to grow to reach some sustainable technology level there is no plan to have a smaller society because our system won't select for that plan and that's part of the the impossible to hard distinction that we made is i think we have a 19 terawatt society right now which is 190 billion light bulbs turned on 24 7. that is the metabolism of the human enterprise [6567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6567.199s)

what is more sustainable what is using our remaining uh lower quality higher cost hydrocarbons hopefully not any coal at all and in combination with our best uh renewable tech nai or whatever uh our work suggests it's closer to 10 terawatts maybe it's five maybe it's 12 i i don't think anyone really knows but [6593](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6593.52s)

it's not 30. uh and i don't think it's 25 either and it's not 19 because these fossil armies that we've woken in the last two centuries we can't continue to add their labor to our workforce they're going to be retiring uh and waking more also they poop and they breathe and [6620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6620.48s)

the externalities from that are are mucking up future generations of ours and other species house a home where we live uh anyways i'm digressing just to say that we have the technology to create energy it's just the quality of it and the scalability of it is not what we have today thank you daniel [6643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6643.92s)

seriously doing these in real time with you helps me understand my own story better and i think we're working towards something important so thank you to be continued my friend if you enjoyed or learned from this episode of the great simplification please subscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform [6665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkv5mpBA8o4&t=6665.04s)
