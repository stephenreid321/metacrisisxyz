hey this is paul i want to continue working on my vein of religion and culture the videos that i made last week the videos that touched on kinfolk and and ross douthat s-- the decadent society you know those things really got me thinking about the idea that your religious ceiling is your cultural ceiling you won't have a cultural revival escape from dalits decadence without a religious revival this is a [31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=31.56s)

very counter secular this is a very counter secularism narrative and i'm gonna play some i'm gonna play some eric weinstein in this eric i think has well anyway we'll get to eric when we get to eric but it's a very counter secularist narrative which is almost always looking for a technical solution and i think that in many ways that's barking up the wrong tree which is sort of where daniel [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=69.479s)

smacked and berger lies and gonna play i've been trying to get through eric weinstein's portal where he thanks kent eric weinstein's portal where he talks to daniel smacking burger i first discovered smacked and burger on rebel wisdom and i really liked the episodes a lot of the episodes that he's been in and his conversation with eric i thought was really very good there's so much [101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=101.07s)

stuff in that conversation and i think it very much barks up this tree about the relationship between religion and culture and a future one of the things that that often strikes me when i listen to some of these celebrity atheists talk about christianity is there is the boredom their boredom with the age to come and it basically goes like this i can't imagine living forever that would [129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=129.209s)

be a real because i get bored in this world and i'll get bored in that world celebrity atheists regularly declare that for them even if this fictitious everlasting afterlife were to be true in an experiential phenomenological way it would be tortured because they can't imagine what they would do everlastingly now this isn't just the celebrity [156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=156.59s)

atheists if you watch the good place they i don't want to give too much away but they basically cave to the same thing that that you can't imagine everlastingly being everlastingly good now the best christian era for the best theologian in the christian reformed church i believe is cornelius planting a junior and he is the younger brother of alvin plantinga and neil plantinga was [183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=183.93s)

my systematics professor at calvin seminary he was my faculty advisor for a couple of years he he was president of calvin seminary i don't think that used the best areas of his gifts last little thing i heard from him he was gonna take some time and write some books which i think is exactly what he needs to be doing i wish he would put more out if you want a taste of his ability read not [212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=212.4s)

the way it's supposed to be a breathy airy of sin which is really an outstanding book and not only is neil a brilliant thinker but he's a absolutely amazing writer and so he in my oh the number of theologians in the christian reformed church now again people sometimes call me a theologian i'm not a theologian i'm a pastor and you'll often hear tim keller make the same comment [242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=242.52s)

the reason being is that i'm not fundamentally an academic sure i read some academic stuff but that's not really my life or my training i'm a pastor and i'm a pastor who has to dabble in theology but you know we also dabble in all sorts of other things that's sort of what being a pastor does but neil in an interview said something to the effect that he [267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=267.06s)

on stuff maybe it wasn't an interview maybe it was a personal conversation i don't know but he wanted to spend some time thinking about essentially thinking about the afterlife and i remember when he said that or when i heard that i thought wow that's that's really good and actually really important because if the further i've gotten into this youtube video talking out loud thing the [286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=286.919s)

more i've realized this is a real this is a real issue in theology today that the ceiling that we're experiencing culturally i think has been around theologically for a while and i probably doubt that really sort of helped me see that and again dalitz book is a really interesting book because to a certain degree he makes the point that you know you're gonna have to listen to miss [320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=320.039s)

frizzle and if you're gonna make progress you're gonna have things are gonna have to get messy you're gonna have to take chances and that's a really scary thing but if you look back over the course of church history it's at the point i've made sort of on the heels of of alister mcgrath spoke heresy which which sam says i'm isn't really in the book but i'm course sort of extending [344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=344.099s)

and well so sort of like the person at the end of the services pastor that sermon really spoke to me and then they say what it spoke to them and i realize i never said it maybe maybe mcgrath didn't say it but but theology and heresy sort of co-develop and so it is a messy process and and so neil wants to take some time to think about death and say i don't want to use heaven i want to [372](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=372.139s)

use the age to come because technically that's a better way of thinking about it heaven is geography in a sense and the age to come is there's a new heavens and a new earth that are seen at the end of the book of revelation and so i think i really want neil to make some progress here because i think this is really something that we need the the thought occurred to me strictly a hypothetical [393](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=393.72s)

story not really a straight cat is rescued by dan idealistic young woman an overly indulgent father refuses to put his foot down to exile the cat into the neighborhood or the pound or as my father would sometimes joke about into a into a sack with stones and a bridge looking over the sacrament or american rivers he didn't have those rivers he [419](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=419.379s)

had the passaic river to joke about the cat might have eked out a short life in an urban setting but it now gets to realize what a human bed is like and what a bowl full of food is like and this is certainly an upgrade from living in the wild you get that if you read the beginning of oh shoot what's the name of that book i can't think of it now but but the author made the observation that [448](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=448.449s)

lions in the zoo we look at those lions in the zoo and say oh they should be out on the serengeti well zoo lions live longer they've got free food and health care and well well well there's something that we notice the is not optimized about the about the about the zoo experience for a lion but the author of that book why can't i think of the book big tiger on the very famous book [477](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=477.069s)

martell is the author you know he makes a really important point in that book that if you were to say if someone were to say zoo logically float down over humanity and look at human being and say oh look at them they're all in these little boxes in there they've all got this food and health care and stuff we should yank them out there and throw them out on the serengeti they'll be [498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=498.759s)

much happier when they're wild yeah human beings don't go there so here's the thing this this cat could never have imagined what living in a human house is like and what having all the silly cat needs are like i'm a cat it's not a terribly grateful animal by the way i'm my dog for being a jerk as my dog is a jerk the cat is is just much more indifferent [523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=523.479s)

and for all of the the for all of the comforts and welfare that this idealistic young woman so known as my daughter has given to this cat the cat is indifferent in some ways but very much once into the house and very much wants onto the bed and very much wants to be fed and on and on and on and on but the cat could never have imagined what a human bed feels [551](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=551.75s)

like why because the cat kenna is not capable of imagining such a thing on its own it's only when a greater consciousness a greater power a greater mind a greater agent a greater master a greater host comes in and provides something for the cat that the cat could never in its wildest dreams imagined nor could the whole community have cats come up with and for that matter well we [581](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=581.81s)

still have questions about what is good and in many ways that haunts a lot of the conversations that we're gonna point to so you know it was wasn't until really i found the the douthit book that i really began to understand eric weinstein and peter teal a lot better because i'd heard them make noises about this one way or another you know especially use of the common use of the [611](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=611.6s)

word sclerosis in this kondos context that douthit really helped me better understand sort of what eric weinstein's banging on about eric's an interesting cat now there's no question a bit an interesting critter there's no question about that but but again doubt that helped contextualize that for me now again i do believe that having a let's call it a modestly sized youtube channel [637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=637.55s)

is about the best source for good information pre-filtered stuff because the kind of tips that you all give me and again i never have enough time to track down all the tips but the kind of tips you guys give me are some of the best stuff that i find and so then i should share it back to you and so the recent the recent portal with eric weinstein and daniel's schmuck smart and [662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=662.54s)

berger i'm sure jobe could have a better way to say that or or some of you germans who are out there in the discord land and then and then ross douthat on the fifth column which is the podcast i'd never heard of but the hosts were really engaging our private listen to some more of them very interesting stuff and again so i want to play some of both of this because it gets into this [691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=691.37s)

question again of the religious ceiling and the cultural ceiling that in a sense you need religious headroom if your culture is actually going to make progress and and now again this idea of progress is itself enormous ly difficult to actually conceptualize and that and that difficulty relative eise's all of these conversations and it especially relative eise's the weinstein [721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=721.49s)

the weinstein brothers in in ways that i don't think they're terribly self-conscious of because again almost every time i listen to them either of them i get the sense that just good is just so completely assumed well within the christendom frame that they are not terribly self-conscious of it one of the things that comes through all of this stuff is this came through with the [751](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=751.49s)

alister mcgrath brent weinstein conversation comes through with john reveille keyes project and a lot of his conversations this aching for a new religion that isn't a religion and somehow we know we need that even though again it's it's the i mean secularism is is perhaps basically the the demand that there be no appeal to self conscious agents above human [778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=778.279s)

beings that's basically it you know no theism no aliens you know we've got a key we hold the bar here and so all of our hope must be found there and i know karl karl and i are carl that's why the iron box of secularism because you can't think above it because it's not allowed that's essentially the secular bargain to say keep it in here thank you very much so [812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=812.64s)

your religious people yeah we know you're out there and we really shouldn't persecute you and but we're not really gonna take too many of you seriously because the this is the playing field and everything needs to stay in these bounds but this keep bumping into needing a new religion is giving away the game so in this conversation they get to the point of wanting to know is [839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=839.7s)

decadence so bad after all oh i didn't set up huh so this stuff isn't on youtube so i'll play it out of my out of my podcast app essential essential to the argument that ross is making though is in understanding that a lot of the economic gains that we've seen and the productivity improvements that we've seen have happened in particular places where the gains have been really [865](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=865.29s)

concentrated in a few ands with these technology companies facebook being like the new gm but only employing 1/10 of the people that a gm might have employed so that is part of the problem and secondarily so so that's that's essentially the argument of the first half of half of dow fitz book the nature of the innovation that we're seeing in some places it's again like some sort of [886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=886.26s)

technology information oriented benefit that is again concentrated to a particular group but also the possibility that some of the gains we've seen as you just mentioned russ are fake like the growth of a company like uber for example it's not clear that this is a sustainable business model in fact all of the indications are that it might not be like in the same thing that we've [911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=911.01s)

seen with we work there running these massive deficits as they have been for a very long time they're doing it with rather cheap money on offer from vcs you seen the phrase free money used at certain points so that all of that creates a circumstance that's rather challenging but i want to see if we can advance the conversation a little bit because we've talked about sort of the [931](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=931.89s)

the four horsemen the stagnation the sterility and the sclerosis and the repetition what's that accent yeah yeah i was an accident that's just camille no there was a growl well we talked about those four things i wonder if we can get into sort of the second section of the book where you talk about sustainable decadence among other things but that section of the [963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=963.31s)

book is probably the only place where i got a little bit queasy when you talked about giving decadence it's do maybe you could talk a little bit about what you saw there and if it's helpful i could prime you by telling you what about it maybe tell me tell me what made you queasy well i'll tell you it's i think you open the chapter by talking about people who are probably following along [983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=983.26s)

with you and thinking to themselves well you know what this decadence thing doesn't sound like such a bad thing yep and and this is again right here now we're getting into the question what is good and so the value question so decadence well a stable economy and and what's so interesting about this is that especially let's say if you go back to alister mcgrath brett weinstein [1005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1005.79s)

conversation sustainability is is is the big thing you know and and that haunts ericsson we get when i jump into eric's podcast sustainability is haunting these conversations because how do we and again the assumption is well we homo sapiens well we not certain kinds of homeless lead the homo sapiens that think like us and you get back to the if you if you haven't listened to my [1033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1033.449s)

conversation where we talked about religion as risk management the this idea that what we're really trying to do it's a very evolutionary idea the idea that what we're trying to do we is essentially secure the future for our progeny but that of course assumes that you can now we'll bring in the fancy verb a key ideas you can exactly figure out what the essence of we is and and [1061](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1061.98s)

that's what makes the let's say the humans evil solving into the borg or some kind of technologically merged creature more than just having a cellphone in hand that that this somehow breaks the narrative or breaks the line and so humanity is cut off in the sense like the neanderthals and so that that leads to the question well well maybe we've [1088](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1088.649s)

arrived well you know it's kind of interesting in 1999 they talk about 1999 in this podcast as a sort of a a little break in decadence well that was the year the matrix came out and that's the year that agent smith tells tells morpheus you know humanity reached its peak in 1999 are we just trying to are we just trying to freeze 1999 and that then is the apex of human civilization [1113](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1113.82s)

what is it in some respects like we've had too much growth and we're endangering our planet and there is the climate catastrophe and if in fact we've actually had all of these good things happen over the course of the last couple hundred years and we've reached this place where you know we've got relatively low rates of crime there's a pretty good amount of wealth out there [1136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1136.409s)

we've got cars and all kinds of other cool stuff in medical technology stasis is an option yep that we can manage our decadence that we could manage this level of stagnation and make certain that we find ways to perhaps redistribute the gains and just protect what we have here and and i think here's the thing that would require a societal religious conversion probably away from [1166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1166.889s)

christianity you know if you go back to the deling pod conversation with with with tom holland tom holland makes the point numerous times that progress is invented by christianity and infused into the world by christianity and of course it goes lots of non-christian places but that's where it comes from and so this this stasis that well maybe we can't afford progress anymore we want [1198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1198.779s)

stasis but but eric dean and brent weinstein and and and ross douthat roman you know conservative committed practicing roman catholic that he is say no no no it's it's upward and outward and and that's christianity that's that's you know it's it's we're on the way to theosis or heaven or the age to come we're we're we're marching towards glory baby and not we've got to [1231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1231.059s)

stop marching and we've got to stay right here well would we bump into the meaning crisis we did to tolstoy and dostoevsky and saying you know well if you if you give human beings everything they want you know again i used back to the illustration of the the alligator in the alligator farm in the everglades that alligator sits in that warm water all the time just waiting for the [1256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1256.59s)

zookeeper to throw bits of chicken in there for them to gobble it up and that alligator will be just fine the lion will be just fine in the pen we are different and actually again in the in the in the smacked and berger weinstein conversation they actually go there with that conversation say and and they talk about what human beings are different from the lion different from the chimp [1286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1286.98s)

different from the alligator in the in the farm why can't we just why can't we just level it out at $19.99 and be happy you know as human batteries making energy for our future cyber overlords but that sort of impulse to protect what we have i presume is what animates the fears of populace that things aren't really getting better anymore yeah but in some [1318](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1318.03s)

respects they're starting to get worse and and and not just the the fears of a of populace because here's the problem if we're gonna do stasis stasis how your dreams of you whether it's the old school climbing to the top your turn at the or off but finally your world where racism and sexism and all the isms are gone imagine imagine that world and and [1342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1342.84s)

and and guess what grandma got stuck and and this is where we as as individuals and we as this imagined collective which again you know gray says well that's that's totally christian where that whole thing comes from oh how does this supposed to work and if we can't stay the same because i've not reached nirvana and to the extent we find ourselves in a place like that i just [1373](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1373.77s)

can't imagine any circumstance under which a citizenry would actually be content with that that they could ever learn to be content with that that they could elect leaders with the specific mandate of hey just just try to keep everything from falling apart just now remember jordan peterson as well and the city on the hill because meaning again is this internal gyroscope meaning is is [1399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1399.48s)

we partake in the sacrament of meaning when we're striving towards the goal what happens when you say no more striving no more striving it's sort of a maybe if buddhism had won the west that's what we've had i don't know if that's unfair i'm sure you'll correct me in the comments section but but no more striving just flatten it out thank you very much let's just it's the what was [1426](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1426.63s)

it madtv had lowered expectations keep the wheels on the bus a little bit longer i think you really only have two options because of entropy a political philosophical entropy you either are growing or you are declining like stasis is in fact a form of decline and i know that when you were writing that section you were speaking to people's concern rather than expressing your own [1451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1451.59s)

sensibilities but certainly as i was reading that i was like already leaping towards the intersection yeah well that's that's i mean but i think a lot of people wouldn't right which is why i you wrote it i mean i think there's you know there is a strong conception in the western world that you know growth has become cancerous and that [[climate change]] requires maybe not budgetary austerity but sort of austerity in everyday living there's a book that came out by german economist after i finished writing my book called fully-grown that basically made a version of this case it said you know yeah economies i mean it's a in a way a version of the george will argument that you were channeling but basically saying 1.5 percent growth for an advanced [1498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1498.66s)

economy is fine and we shouldn't you know and we should just want other countries to advance as far as we have and then we can all be fully grown together and the seem to leave in his book i'd know like george will and i mean i basically have two views one is that that that sort of politics of stasis is better than a sort of destructive let's tear it all down you [1523](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1523.44s)

know tyler durden in fight club another 1999 movie right they're like like it's better better stasis than some of this sort of rebel at least for those who have something to lose for those who have nothing left to lose which again is why you know the west has been amazingly good and and again they talked about porn and drugs a little bit in this podcast but another great section in the [1550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1550.32s)

in the portal podcast which i won't play to you just get everybody pot and porn and that's why you have no civil wars because after all you know might not be as good as i can and i might not ever actually have be able to have sex with all those beautiful women on the flickering screen well at least i've got my basement and my cheetos dust to comfort me lucian area alternatives [1576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1576.15s)

because michael was saying the politics of anti decadence can be very dangerous right you get you know not just the nazis but world war one you get some of the mood after 9/11 which was very much like decadence is over now and we're gonna go you know spread democracy to the islamic world so i want to mit i wanted to make that point but then at the same time yeah i basically agree [1595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1595.77s)

with you i think that i think you can have stasis longer than people think but it's a stasis that will include a certain amount of disk decay and a certain sort of what i think i call something like the slide towards [[dystopia]] so it's not that you're like you know you give up on growth in the next day it's aldous huxley or you know brave new world but you sort of slide in [1618](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1618.61s)

that direction and i think the technologies we have right now i think encourage that in certain ways that you can have a world where you know people sort of work out their discontents with decadence by playing video games or but you know by sort of participating in vigorous activity that is you know not actually located in the real world or in politics that people [1643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1643.78s)

can be discontented with decadence and manifest that and how they behave on [[social media]] rather than in like political organizing or anything that might meaningfully change the world and so you know it's a shocking thing that for all our talk of of political polarization and gridlock you know once the pandemic hit bang two trillion dollars came at that wallet pretty darn [1665](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1665.23s)

fast i when i imagine us that kind of stasis that's what i imagine happening people sort of engaging more and more in sort of did i say wallet i mean credit card virtual role-playing actual politics and so sort of social life withering a bit and things sort of sliding towards a dark place but pretty slowly so slowly that maybe you don't notice it till you end up end up there [1691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1691.33s)

which one of these things i mean readings because it's it's it was interesting for me to try to read your level of worry on each each one of these topics i mean of course you have government technology to pornography fertility rates is there one area in which you're fretting more than the other areas where you say you know this one is something that i don't see being [1713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1713.8s)

rolled back anytime soon and and it's going to you know precipitate this this slide to horrible decadence i mean i think it's probably clear from reading the book that i'm most worried about this sort of this sort of brave new world scenario where things stabilize in a way that sort of slowly dehumanizing us and drugs as drugs become more sophisticated [1736](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1736.14s)

video games become more sophisticated and we sort of accept this yeah this sort of decaying stability that loses basic human goods you know people people don't marry and have kids they sort of lose themselves in you know i compare it to the land of the lotus eaters right didn't odysseus and i don't think we're anywhere close to there to the darkest place yet but i think that's been the [1762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1762.09s)

trend of the last 25 or 30 years right towards this like in teenage life right now do you gauge life in the u.s. is safer than it's ever been um in terms of whether you're gonna drive drunk or you know have sex or did all these things and these are all things conservatives were obviously very concerned about 30 years ago so in a way you could say well this is what conservatives wanted but [1783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1783.78s)

those same kids are not sort of well one they're more depressed and more anxious seemingly i think pretty clearly than even when i was in call know what's really interesting about douthit spook is he has nothing good to say about jordan peterson jordan peterson gets like two or three mentions in the book but what he's talking about here is exactly what the jordan peterson moment [1804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1804.59s)

was around and so now douthit from his from his his peaks of status that that have him living in in new haven connecticut and working for the new york times can't seem i don't think he understands jordan peterson the way he should but this is very much is where decadence meets the meaning crisis it's right there which they're more likely to commit suicide and then they're for now [1831](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1831.72s)

at least less likely to fall in love get married and have kids and sort of enter what in a conservative would think of a sort of a normal trajectory towards human flourishing and and so there's been this sort of trade-off of sort of more social stability than thirty forty years ago but maybe less happiness and less flourishing so that's what i worry about the most again like in terms of [1856](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1856.11s)

our ability to respond to threats though i think it's the sclerosis of institutions that's the most dangerous so if you're worried about and the coronavirus or anything that could lead to mass extinction true disaster you should worry most about the inability of our institutions to function anymore is is this a catholic book sure all my books are catholic it's a good it's a [1882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1882.69s)

great it's a great podcast you should listen to it i'm i'm i do like one offs of a lot of different podcasts but after listening to this one i thought listen to some more of these guys but but i thought douthit made the point well of well here's decadence and again this is what i've heard eric and and peter teal talk about but now suddenly here in this in this with with daniel smacking burger [1911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1911.61s)

eric starts going down a different take and and eric is is over time laying more and more of his cards on the table maybe i just haven't listened to everything that eric is doing or these putting out a lot now okay this is this is a long one and and there there's i found so much stuff that have provoked insight in me in this podcast i'm really tempted to sort of outline it and if anybody and if [1935](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1935.16s)

any of you know whether he's doing transcripts or anything like that out of this let me know you know his getting this stuff up on youtube is always a long time after maybe he's not everybody works is cheap and dirty as me but he actually has real commercials on his podcast but but this is they both sort of you know they can do some things and by about 22 minutes they start to get [1961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1961.53s)

into stuff alright so let me let me give a little bit of my frame we can try to pass things back and forth and feel free to take over if you like but here's what i see that i think of is being really interesting and rather mysterious i see a decision tree in which i think at a society-wide level i can't accept any of the major branches so one branch would be that we we have a self-extinguishing [1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=1991.08s)

human event let's say an all-out nuclear war where people miscalculate and the planet is unrecognizable then there's a different branch that says that some sort of a environmental collapse maybe with a nuclear exchange or some sort of synthetic biology who knows what where there are survivors but it's not it's not the world that we see at our window here then there's another one [2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2015.399s)

which says maybe we managed to trundle on for another thousand years somehow limping along without any major new ideas we're still using markets there's the decadent option things are getting incrementally better maybe there some big breakthroughs here and there but there's no big breakthrough in human wisdom so that we have the same love that wisdom came in there in dangerous [2039](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2039.7s)

objects but we continue to be lucky that nobody weaponize 'as these things and that there's no broad collapse then there's an escape branch where we we end up on mars or maybe we escape even farther out in the universe or maybe we get uploaded into silicon there's no part of this tree see now right there we get uploaded into so again we go out to space who is we now again back to the [2064](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2064.06s)

risk management idea of religion religion is about securing your your legacy your progeny your line now terribly fuzzy on what this line is and and even what necessarily well-being is especially when you look at the decadent option because you know essentially what what what doubt that does is just sort of lay the decadence and the meaning crisis just lays them together even [2095](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2095.32s)

though dalfen i don't know if he's heard of john verve a key and and he doesn't seem to have much appreciation for jordan peterson but you're laying it right there it's the same point and again that the main question here is is is our religious ceiling our cultural ceiling and and in order to get beyond it and i gotta be careful here cuz i got plenty of new age friends that would say [2120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2120.609s)

to me of course paul we need a new consciousness and i just kind of roll my eyes and say well what do you mean by that we need a new consciousness you can't even explain to me the consciousness that i know and i've lived in all my life or at least since the age of four or whatever what and and and this again is where you know this is this [2143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2143.63s)

again is where i appreciate you know the conversations that we're having in our little corner of the internet because we need to talk about this and and and when i look at political solutions are technical and remember politics is now in a religion as always so if you're actually going to move politics you have to move the vision of always and you have to move the vision of good and and [2174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2174.98s)

this is why you know these guys keep talking and it's religion no but i'm not gonna talk to religious people and fair enough because and i really appreciate doubt that's honesty and the other podcasts a little bit later he talks about the decadence of the roman catholic church was the decadence of the catholic church that prompted the protestant reformation [2198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2198.95s)

there's plenty of decadence in the protestants now we've been around for hundreds of years there's plenty of decadence in theology there's plenty of plenty of things that have just sort of withered and you know now in this strange pandemic church realm i get to kind of peek in at what other pastors are doing with their sermons and overhear stuff and i think nobody's [2223](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2223.16s)

doing anything new churches the church was in decadence long before these guys so i don't blame them for not wanting to listen to anybody from a church i don't blame them for that i can understand it but i think that's part of your dead end too and and this goes back again to to richard marsten's book on the twilight of the american enlightenment and i forget what else what other i was [2251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2251.93s)

reading on that you know if you if you look at it was dow fitz book you know if you look at the 50s and the 60s you still had conversation including religious people now i i don't want to cast the blame here and say that they stopped looking to the tree because it wasn't bearing fruit or they couldn't see the fruit because they weren't looking at it but [2279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2279.8s)

there's something here and now this is really dangerous stuff for conservative religious people because part of religious conservatism is trying to not lose what you've achieved but so much of the religious left is so fruitless anyway because it's just so pornographic it's so self-indulgent and and it's so me too ish in terms of well whatever whatever the the new hot social thing is [2317](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2317.51s)

you know what what color flag do i need to fly next will you love me now and i think about a cure of the gun dawn's comment in one video where you know how much more naked can madonna get there's a sense in multiple aspects that we've painted ourselves into a corner and a technical solution is not what we need look sensible to me every single branch is somewhere in sci-fi are you seeing [2345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2345.29s)

something that looks like that or do you have some branches that you think are more probable and more hopeful more hopeful yes probable no but i can't do a probability calculation because they're unprecedented so i don't have priors after you have to impute yeah so the first two that you said [[existential risk]] and [[catastrophic risk]] this certainly lots of different ways for both of those [2369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2369.89s)

to occur they get that are getting increasingly likely i hope time goes on as i model it and i think we should get into that the idea that it continues relatively similar to how it is for a thousand years i don't see possible at all and i can say why so he says that decadence that ain't gonna work i think this civilization system is [2390](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2390.5s)

actually [[self-terminating]] in a much shorter time than that inexorably like there is no way that it could continue for very long and so the escape models i'm fairly dubious of not because we couldn't with near-term tech get some people into space but we certainly couldn't get something that doesn't depend on earth that if we  __  things up here it's doing well [2414](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2414.92s)

and and you know cs lewis deals with some of this and louis in the middle of the 20th century was writing about space travel and basically his assertion was you know if we get into space as we are now and if we would actually find you know life on other planets we would do to them what we did to the americas i mean this is this is what we do it's probably for the safety of you [2446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2446.87s)

know others in the universe if they're out there that we're quarantined here in this little solar system because no smacked and berger is exactly right that escape so we would bring all our problems with us it's the stereotypical person who left that bad marriage only to make another bad marriage because guess what half of the problems they took with into marriage number two [2478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2478.22s)

that's how we are and we know that about ourselves so you know it's there's not going to be a technical solution within the time frames that i think will  __  things up on earth at least the trajectory as i see it so doesn't the question you asked is there some other thing like progress to a totally different type of [[social system]] here or totally different type of civilization [2506](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2506.24s)

system that can continue for a long time that isn't [[self-terminating]] and that isn't generating catastrophic and [[existential risk|existential risks]] as the byproduct of the architecture of the system itself is really the only path so oh and i think some acton burger is exactly right and i think that is in some ways the point i'm trying to make that if you're going to have a new social arrangement [2530](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2530.9s)

is predated by a new vision of that social arrangement that is communally seen as good and that is pretty darn close to what a religion is it's an ideal out there above ourselves beyond our self that we that motivates us that we care enough about that moves us in such a way but it also moves us in a way that is life-giving in a 360-degree manner that's what we're talking about [2564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2564.95s)

have we achieved the limits of our imaginary where we're dostoevsky and remember these things move slowly and and and so i think bringing you know the russians into this not putin but dostoevsky and tolstoy um you know pleasuring ourselves we smash the system we smash the keys we end the decadence if otherwise you know it's its meaning crisis or anarchy unless you have a [2598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2598.43s)

vision which goes beyond and again i think doubt fits book begins to touch on that and and the wh auden quote that you know the russians not the russians the romans they weren't going anywhere for centuries and actually in what was happening in in the roman period was that christianity was incubating and slowly evolving and taking over the system and again again this isn't going [2629](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2629.75s)

to satisfy anyone because the speed of change is far larger than any of our own little lies well then how can change be tracked well change has been tracked and we've seen this by what we write in books basically by religious the religious tracking systems have been the tracking systems we have used and again in many ways this goes back to i think what was at the heart of jordan [2659](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2659.5s)

peterson's agenda there there there's of course new religions all the time and so the woke religion has been a religion but it's it's a dead end and and again this critic of this the feminist case for jordan peterson that i mentioned for many young people peterson's message is startling they have been presented with awoke political narrative that views human suffering as [2684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2684.0s)

the result of an unequal distribution of power that's certainly true with those that top of the hierarchy abusing those at the bottom for their own gain well that's certainly true what they don't understand is that the germ that's inside all the people with power and the people with wealth is inside everybody else and something needs to die and again if you realize that well where did [2707](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2707.19s)

that idea come from well you see it in the image of someone on a cross who by virtue of his assertion has absolutely everything son of man and son of god and comes down and makes himself nothing philippians chapter 2 and and and we all get that but we can't all do that why and and again if you someone looking in from the outside would say this all sounds just like christianity with the [2741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2741.57s)

division but but again don't don't get me wrong i think doubt it's dead-on right that the church is decadent not just the roman catholic church and you know part of what's interesting about the the orthodox renaissance in the americas it's it's sort of their turn the roman catholics had a renaissance when it came to america and and i think the orthodox are having it now the [2767](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2767.19s)

protestants got here first so perhaps we're the most decadent of all and and that's why well with the the quite likely the you know protestant decadence reached its peak during the cold war if only power could be removed from these people the story goes then we could arrive at the kingdom of heaven on earth except that new people have power and so the whole thing starts over again [2791](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2791.55s)

peterson says otherwise he insists that suffering is our lot as human beings and hierarchies are inevitable part of that and so for peters it's the striving up the hill but you never get to the top because it's in the striving that you partake of the sacrament of the feeling of meaning now its decadence and the meaning crisis come right smack together they go [2818](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2818.79s)

together and when dalit gets to that point in the second part of the book yeah you're right there in the meaning crisis ross you should listen to peterson you should listen to verve a key they're talking about the same thing but but and that's why suddenly verve a key and peterson everyone all the atheists hear them as religious you're not gonna hear them any [2842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2842.76s)

other way because the religious people who know what religion sounds like mcgrath listens to brent weinstein and says sounds like you're advocating for a new religion eric's doing the same thing you need to do thout ian decadence to have the luxury of a gaming pc and a broadband sufficient to pleasure yourself covered with cheetos dust we are struggling to imagine a way out and [2869](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2869.369s)

and that comes clear in in the in in that's that's eric's mission that's what got eric churning out stuff that's why eric you know and and when he talks about i can't i can't sit around anymore i'm gonna go out there and risk it all good for him and and when you listen to when i've heard eric and other places you know go out and try things yeah but how do you have any confidence that [2903](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2903.869s)

anything will matter in any way the weinsteins are earnestly seeking a path to maintain a we without necessarily a whole lot of thought into what we is well always a complaining about the status quo and and some acton burger i think is dead-on right we has to change communally we have to change individually we have to change its transformation it's aching for a new [2933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2933.53s)

religion up but no conscious agents above ourselves and what's interesting is that again thus macton burg they start and rebel wisdom is knocking on the same door they're starting to talk about well collective collective consciousness collective agency [[collective intelligence]] they real i mean it's it's it's and it's it's sort of like jordan it's sort of a natural [2959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2959.58s)

theology way of trying to build up the tower of babel well we know that individually well that's right so now we're talking principalities and powers and this is what brings padua into the conversation because he's just working from the old system and people that well that's new no it's really old and so if you actually want to work on this you're gonna have to pay attention to the old [2982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=2982.98s)

and the now is it this decadence that we are trying to maintain even if you like its unstable and unsustainable now note about theology that i made up more often in my earlier videos when i was doing more theological stuff and commenting on jordans biblical series we may declare eschatology is is an interesting thing we we declare revelation as unchanging infallible revelation and quite rightly [3019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3019.06s)

so and again if you listen to my same sex you don't make progress dismissing the past as such chesterton is dead on right here you have to give your ancestors a seat at the table because all of us today are bound in the bubble of now and that has to be done in a rigorous way and my argument that i've made often in videos about brett is that this is exactly what theology does this [3053](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3053.09s)

is exactly what religious communities do this is exactly the project of religion and it's why you you hold a book up high and you do that intention now again to the the silly arguments i hear coming from the likes of sam harris you don't have christians holding slaves you and and what you find in religious communities like christianity is you have the [3079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3079.31s)

orthodox who are deeply conservative you have the roman catholic who are very conservative but both managing change within their institutions the protestants proliferating institutional containers in order to try new things it's all this stuff and and so again the the enormous blindside of the intellectual dark web which for me seems to be the the group that is really [3106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3106.07s)

earnestly trying to wrestle with this is their complete their near complete indifference to religious conversation and again i understand the decadence is is is frightful douthit makes that point but here we are and and and what we're basically doing is religion so you might as well talk to some people who actually have some lived experience in it now i'm not advocating [3135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3135.2s)

for myself and people are like well you should get on eric show i don't know if that conversation would go well or not because one of the things that is true about conversations is it takes a long time and i think one of the things that peterson did was he at least via young took religion seriously and i still think that's part of the reason why his contributions were outstanding now why [3164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3164.56s)

do i say his contributions were outstanding because even though brett and eric are making noise and have developed something of a following jordan put a whoosh through the culture that's important and and and and i don't expect to see any similar whoosh from brett or eric and and brett and eric are about as smart as you can find a beginner i'll tell you i listen this [3193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3193.19s)

guy's is like holy cow these guys are brilliant but it isn't just intelligence it's a whole life and and in some ways you know that's what jordans been doing so at least jordan is openness to religion i think it's part of the reason he was able to to make the whoosh that the others haven't been able to make back again about theology you need a fixed point if the kite is going to fly [3225](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3225.26s)

you need a fixed ruler if you're going to be able to notice progress and i think douthit is helpful because at least douthit knows religion now he has sufficient status that you know maybe i'll put my two cents in probably brett and ross should talk because they might be able to have a productive conversation the thing is we need analogies and so you know one of the [3252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3252.83s)

things that i've said about the age to come is you know streets of gold no more tears you find them in isaiah you find them in revelation you'll find them scattered in a few other places and then like i was talking with with brett shackled you need analogies you can't work without analogies but all are analogies fall short and and so what what happens then in decadence is so if [3278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3278.87s)

you look at this little image that i grabbed i did my zeitgeist check me agooo gle google images you know you just search an image you just search and searching a non-material concept and see what images come up and oh here you are it's it's the emerald city it's the yellow brick rolled it's the you know the city foursquare and actually if you read the book of revelation it looks [3308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3308.15s)

more like a borg cube we need analogies but our analogies fall short and and and in some ways the pictures we draw mark the limit of our imagination of our collective imagination what we have is a crisis of x khatallah g and this is an old crisis and i again i mentioned before in theological ii you have you have the pre mills and post mills and the ah mills again those [3336](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3336.82s)

of you without any theological understanding the premillennial the post millennia on the amillennial based on how they're trying to figure out revelation chapter 20s kia eschatology is one of the theological areas that continues to resist consensus or at least broad consensus in the church there are no church councils on on eschatology now now i don't know enough [3359](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3359.19s)

so someone will correct me in the comments and have at it you know but but it's interesting how dispensationalist rapture ideas have been you know creeping up in hbo series and resurrection comes back and you know hershel and the walking dead commentary on that then the post mills were discredited by world war one and the ah mills you know like myself you know [3386](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3386.2s)

really the i think that most of the historic segments of the church or you know some sleepy avoidance about this area we don't we don't know and that's why i hope neil planning it can do something with it because i think we desperately need it because this is when i when i listen to eric and daniel smacked and burger if i can ever learn to say that man's name right they're [3413](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3413.92s)

bumping up against the eschatological ceiling it's a theological ceiling it's a it's a it's a ceiling they're not aware of i don't want to say glass ceiling because that's gonna lead to a whole bunch of other things we're trying to do eschatology without god you know it's so often when i was listening to that podcast and listening to the to some of the real hard problems that that [3441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3441.88s)

that brett and and and daniel were bumping into if you if you have much understanding of the history of theology and again i'm i'm a pastor i'm not an academic and to talk to someone like something like like brett or or other academics they know far more than i do but but you hear and it's like well when when when theologians bumped into that problem god was the answer and it was [3472](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3472.99s)

often a fuzzy answer but but god in a sense was the idea that made all the equations balance and and and so you know certainly there is a god of the gaps problem inherent in there but but at least the equations balanced and so this is where progress has to move forward and we have limits like my cat has limits of imagination we can't imagine anything better because we [3502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3502.93s)

simply cut off the fact that there could be someone out there who has in fact known better and maybe we're not listening and we don't know what to do that with that and so in a sense what you wait is for that one to open the door and say listen kitty this is what a real bed looks like this is what indoor heating and cooling look like here's food you want to go back out and live [3533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3533.02s)

under the house and what the cat does the cat always wants to get out cat won't be out for too long and the weather gets bad or the cat gets hungry and it's not as much fun chasing birds as laying on that big soft posturepedic with the nice cotton sheets and the nice down comforter and the heat turning on every now and then that's exactly what that little decadent kitty wants for a [3558](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3558.7s)

long nap so again religion and culture your religious ceiling is your cultural ceiling and i think smacked and smacking burger is is is seeing correctly that there's no technical solution to us give us more mere give us more power and money and we'll simply repeat there needs to be a transformation of us and that's something that continues to be beyond us even though we're always [3599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3599.08s)

participants in it and a again and i just saw a tweet today with jordan sitting by a desk working on his book and i really hope the book isn't a decadent version of the first book because at least peterson i think was grappling with these in a more serious way i think in some ways his book tour got decadent too much repetition too much now i'd really like to see him [3630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvG3zbKGa4&t=3630.339s)
