music hey everybody this is a film where we're trying to make sense of the information landscape in 2021 and we decided to get a little bit of help from some of the faculty on our online course [[sensemaking]] 101 people like daniel schmacktenberger i see a huge amount of just lack of agency nihilism [19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=19.68s)

and then insofar as people get engaged it's almost all with the combination of certainty and sanctimony which is such a kind of sad combination of things but like moral certainty and epistemic certainty both of which are unwarranted and just the righteous outgrouping of everybody who disagrees like like a feeling of righteousness [46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=46.48s)

for saying how wrong they are because those people are polluting the information ecology so badly and um whether those people are the terrible antifas or the terrible trump supporters or the like both sides are doing the same thing in this particular way some are they use different tools and mechanisms um [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=64.0s)

some of them are more effective at it than others uh but the good faith dialogue that leads to new insights on both people's part and that is where it's entered with earnestness and curiosity and openness to kind of co-learn together like a that happens in places like the the rebel wisdom community it happens in little bitty pockets [88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=88.56s)

but it's not part of public culture right now which basically means public culture is a kind of dying thing unless we um turn that around and also the cognitive scientist john viveki i want people to understand reason and wisdom as this capacity to deeply listen which sounds absolutely trivial and useless right but it's it's the idea is well no no there's a very active powerful form of listening and you do it when you're listening to music so way back at the beginning heraclitus said don't listen to my words listen to the logos and recognize that everything is one [132](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=132.8s)

right he's trying to get people to learn to listen to the logos in that comprehensive in both senses of the word contemplation of reality and only if we recover that resonance will we recover the power of reason to find it compelling again in a deep and fundamental way and that's what i'm most interested [155](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=155.04s)

in right now and the facilitator sarah ness who's been wrestling with polarization and division in the classes she runs what i'm struggling to make sense of right now aside from the entire world and the environment and like the brain and relationships aside from that um i am really [171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=171.599s)

intrigued and worried um but also fascinated by the amount of polarization that's happening right now um and not just polarization but how much each side is like going towards views that have like no um possibility for deviance and i'm really curious about the way that our views are getting associated [194](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=194.72s)

with identity and why there's such echo chambers and um it's worrying for my own work because my work is all about like how do people connect with each other so this film is kind of awkwardly poised between a piece of content and a little bit of plug for the course as you know [211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=211.599s)

almost all of our content is delivered for free we've got to pay for it somehow we don't take ads watch this consider coming on the course but i think there's enough good content in this film anyway if you just want to watch it for that yeah so we've been talking a lot about the the fragmentation the information landscape recently like [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=228.159s)

where are you at with it all what do you make of it i feel like we're in a really interesting time now in 2021 it kind of feels very confused to me like we had so much intensity last year with the pandemic the information ecology getting really really fragmented once all of these kind of divisions over what's true and what [245](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=245.84s)

isn't takes on this sort of like health implications as well we saw a lot of crackdowns from big tech platforms we saw all of these kind of little ecosystems arriving in so many different areas and we covered a lot of the kind of the rise of um con spirituality the kind of the new religions of q anon the kind of aftermath of the the kind of [265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=265.919s)

black lives matter protest and the kind of group think in the media covered that a lot in the [[sensemaking]] series and they felt like this real intensity leading up to the american election a lot of us thought that it was going to go you know kind of thought civil war might be a possibility we thought things were [284](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=284.08s)

going to intensify and trump was this kind of uniting thing like pro and against and everything was seen through that prison of being pro and against trump and what i'm seeing happening now afterwards is is an increased kind of it feels like a lot of the intensity is lower for sure but there's an increased kind [302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=302.88s)

of fragmentation and this idea that our friend peter limberg talks about these memetic tribes the idea that it's not just left against right it's also kind of divisions within tribes as well and that's what i'm seeing when i go on twitter now what i'm seeing is a lot of the conflicts are within [321](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=321.84s)

different tribes they're within the different kind of um there's a lot of fissures and fragmentation it seems like almost infinite fragmentation like people falling out with each other you take sort of sam harris declaring no longer being part of the idw a lot of these kind of fishers are emerging within within all of these kind [343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=343.199s)

of previously coherent tribes i think possibly because trump and the anti-trump is no longer there to kind of keep things together and so everything seems to be fragmenting which makes it more difficult to make sense of things like a lot of the fixed points and obviously the ideological capture of [361](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=361.52s)

all the different sides and in particular what i find really fascinating and kind of weirdly terrifying is the amount of certainty that daniel points to the amount of certainty among people around things like they can't be certain about like medical issues or like at some point you're always judging kind of who can you trust or [388](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=388.08s)

whose opinion you're going to trust it always often comes down to an appeal to authority and this is yeah it's fascinating and it kind of points to what we've been trying to do at least for the last year especially since we launched [[sensemaking]] 101 is like how can we make sense together how can we use the skills of kind of [411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=411.039s)

self-awareness working out when we're being manipulated when we're being limitedly hijacked kind of being very aware of that reaction how can we then kind of look at the different sides of different perspectives how can we have like a reverse media diet check out stuff that would normally we wouldn't look at and kind of have this idea of okay how can we really challenge ourselves and how can we use some of the skills of discernment of mindfulness of presence of how do we relate to each other to kind of try and make sense of the information landscape well some people believe stuff because it appeals to particular aesthetics that they have [450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=450.08s)

some people believe stuff because it makes them be part of an in-group that they really want to be an in-group with some people believe stuff because they just like to be disagreeable or because they like to be agreeable and that was the dominant culture they came into or like whatever all of these biases that affect it so the first person epistemic says can i [466](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=466.72s)

notice as i'm trying epistemology is about knowing right so there's the knowing about the thing that i'm trying to know how do i do that but there's also knowing about the knower what is my own bias and my process of knowing right and this the second person epidemics is not only can if i'm trying to do this [485](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=485.84s)

in conversation with other people can i come to understand their perspective because there might be some truth in their perspective what the values are can i also understand the way that i'm influenced by the perspectives of the people that i'm around music because of wanting approval and wanting [503](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=503.68s)

to fit in and wanting to seem smart and not wanting to be out grouped and those types of things so there's a lot of like to really get [[sensemaking]] the [[sensemaking]] about myself [[sensemaking]] about the human social world and [[sensemaking]] about the non-human rest of the world and they they're all recursive they all [522](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=522.8s)

affect each other so kind of you either work on them all together or you'll probably just suck at them all um and so what what i really like about the course you guys put together is that it's working on all three of those there's the the inquiry into where are our own biases that mess up our [[sensemaking]] how do we get better at communicating effectively and earnestly and listening and in good faith with others to understand where they're coming from and understand how it affects where we're coming from and how do we do a better job of critical thinking and rationality and observing and um forecasting et cetera and uh so it's not [[personal development]] just so i'm happier but it's also not focused on the world pretending like what i bring to it doesn't matter it's really at the intersection which is why i have been happy to keep uh coming and sharing here and for what it's worth because a lot of people know that all most of the information has some vested [585](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=585.92s)

interest behind it economic or otherwise i don't i have never received any uh pay from these courses you guys offered but uh i think the course should be paid for because otherwise like you have to have video equipment you have to produce it like you have stuff to do and otherwise you need to sell ads now [607](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=607.839s)

selling the ads would ruin the whole thing so i think as long as we still have business as a thing business should provide a good or service that's valuable for people this is a real service that's valuable um and i think most everyone that's involved is involved more because they actually believe in the mission [623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=623.6s)

yeah something that strikes me just looking out my window in 2021 sort of metaphorically is yeah certainly a sense of deep fragmentation and and the sense of almost the image that comes to me is um being in the desert you know lots of different memetic tribes who have who kind of center around an ideological [641](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=641.839s)

position very often um being sort of distinct from one another but without anything to bind them and i do think trump and brexit is worth mentioning as well i think these kind of large uh shifts in in culture and values and the sort of singular point of focus of either doesn't really matter if it was for or [662](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=662.399s)

against there was a kind of unifying factor and covet as well was also in a strange way unifying factor with those gone that that's it there's no unifying factor and i just have this image of of just many tribes not really linked by anything and i think what's what's important is that we you know we [680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=680.32s)

talk about [[sensemaking]] a lot on the channel which is literally our ability to make sense to figure out what's going on and doing that in a very complex environment so it's not the same as just mapping out a plan of okay well i know this i know this and this is going to lead me here that only works if the environment is [695](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=695.04s)

fairly is staying the same basically but we're in an environment where things are constantly changing you try and grasp one truth it turns out to be partial you're like okay i've got to hold multiple perspectives since we know one of the skills we focus on a lot you know decentering which is one of the five facets of mindfulness [712](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=712.8s)

which is that ability to take a step back and not be immediately um not immediately react to the content of your experience that's absolutely crucial if you're reading two different articles with two completely different truth claims and they you know contradict each other entirely it really helps to have that space [730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=730.16s)

to go okay well i'm not going to jump to that conclusion i'm not going to jump to that you know that's actually kind of pure academia if you think about it in those terms so they're [[sensemaking]] that's really key because then we you know we can orient ourselves and figure out where we're going [742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=742.399s)

and what to trust is a huge thing but there's also [[meaning making]] and something daniel schmackenberger talks about as well they kind of they often go together making sense and then making meaning coherently and i think there's a huge dearth of [[meaning making]] or good [[meaning making]] um and i think john viveki talks about this you know really really well i mean this is you know probably one of the people who's pioneered our understanding of uh you know what he calls the meaning crisis the other really big thing is this kind of shared sense i think when i express it a lot of people seem to have is a lack of novelty like a sense that [775](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=775.839s)

everything feels like it's a little bit played out it's a little bit like we've heard this before we've heard this before we know what this person's going to say like you find a new person a new kind of podcast host or whatever and you listen to them for a while it's like okay now i kind of know what that person's going to say and the sort of the lack of the lack of conversations to take us in a new play new direction which i think is partly because we're so walled off in these ecosystems and people are kind of aligned with different positions and no one really wants to budge and it's very dangerous if you start to kind of shift and then people on your own [808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=808.639s)

side start to dislike you all of that sort of stuff like all of that sense of where's good faith gone like that's a big question and also where is genuine novelty in terms of going somewhere new like emergent dialogue i mean there's not a really good way to describe it's what john viveki calls dear logos it's like how can we enter into a [829](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=829.199s)

conversation that can go somewhere new and john has made that the focus of his of his work that's what's amazing about he's he's really pursuing what is the scientific basis for emergent dialogue there's all of these different modalities around it like circling like um authentic relating and if you've had that experience where you're [848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=848.079s)

expressing something that maybe you've expressed for the first time and you're expressing you're trying to articulate novelty new and new and to build a new relationship with someone and learn something as you're speaking and as you're exploring that's the thing it's dear logos and john is basically we've tried to build the whole course around this experience of dear logos around this experience of inquiry and that's what john has really been pursuing in his work it's now becoming really pertinent to me and it's sort of the linking question between wisdom and meaning which is and i hear people saying this all the [882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=882.959s)

time why can't we listen to reason and they're usually accusing the other side why can't they listen to reason why they can't why can't they listen to reason and then the reason the reasons that are given are usually i think myopic or or or incomplete you know it's because the other side is stupid or the other side is weak or or right or the other side is [901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=901.6s)

manipulated um and of course and then there's you know while there's the technology and all that but that i don't think that's so that might be sort of how the question sits for us today but the question that i'm really interested in is the deeper one and it's so it's both perennial and pertinent uh [918](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=918.959s)

because plato's asking the question too as athenian democracy is entering into significant decline as well so i thought oh um this is something i keep coming back to um and so schindler has a has a thesis that's very similar to mine that reason has been truncated and he goes through some of the usual historical [939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=939.279s)

suspects that i went through luther and rousseau and then there's aspects of a descarte but then i got really interested in this question about well what sometimes we say this and let's say let's let's put aside all the post-modern critiques for a second sometimes we say this we mean it [959](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=959.04s)

sincerely and authentically that's a compelling argument what does that actually actually mean what does it mean and what does it mean for us and why have we lost that to a significant degree and so what i'm really interested interested in right now is why can't we listen to reason and not and i don't want to give the knee jerk superficial answers because they're actually symptomatic of the very problem that we're trying to address right we're getting we don't know we what we've developed is because of luther and rousseau and descartes we've developed a note we've we first [997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=997.68s)

turned reason into rationalism the idea that thinking is just computation it's just a purely formal system and i think we've misunderstood the legitimacy of some of the postmodern critiques because the post-modern critiques i would argue actually converge with a lot of critiques that came out of [1017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1017.839s)

4e cognitive science which is the problem with computation is it can't capture meaning and it can't capture relevance and that's so the post-modernist basically i mean this is in darada he thinks he follows the sewer he says language is like a chess game that's a prototypical formal system think about a chess game [1035](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1035.919s)

the pieces don't have any meaning to the world they only have a purely formal relationship to each other and and they and therefore they only have an instrumental value we just manipulate them however we will just like how we can program a computer however we will and so we started to think of ourselves as [1051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1051.12s)

computers and then we started to build computers and surround ourselves with computers and so we've developed this empty purely formal purely instrumental manipulative technical sense of reason and though and so we've identified reason people are being rational when they're being very much like computers the [1068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1068.96s)

purely logical purely formal only right and then and then we said and and like a computer it's just a tool that's at the service of other things uh so and we see this like yeah what's the point of reasoning well give me the application give me the bottom line right give me some power over other [1085](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1085.919s)

people or power over the world and what plato and socrates were trying to do uh schindler argues and i think it's brilliant is they were trying to get us out of that consumptive view of reason purely instrumental and then back into the communicative but the problem with the communicative is we [1107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1107.12s)

can think that the point of reason is to persuade other people and then they wanted to go back through that to what i would call contemplative reason and i want to use an analogy here instead of thinking of reason as empty as an empty technical instrument i want you to think about something we [1124](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1124.16s)

do for its own sake uh serious play music so and notice we are also trivializing music so there's a strong analogy here what is it we're doing when we're listening to music well we're seriously playing with our ability to make sense of things what's the point what's the bottom line what's the application well how are we [1142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1142.32s)

we're not doing any of that what we're trying to do is to come into a right relationship with ourselves with other people and reality and that's it we're not trying to do anything beyond that that's so right music has this capacity to bring us into a proper authentic state of contemplation and we do it for its own sake and in fact we will make sacrifices to be able to get to that place and then we that is where it's precisely because music in in in an instrumental sense is absolutely pointless that it has the power to compel us and we need to recover we need to learn how to [1185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1185.919s)

listen to the musicality of being we need to recover reason as this contemplative listening notice right what you do in music you're it's it's it's it's both compre it's comprehensive in two senses of the word you're trying to comprehend it but you're also trying to get the whole you're trying to see all the parts in [1204](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1204.96s)

the whole and all the whole in the parts and that's what we're supposed to be doing there is no mythology for this listening to the music of the spheres so john russon and others have argued you know we should remember that intelligibility right which is our primary way of being connected to the world has a musicality [1221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1221.76s)

to it and what i want to point to is that part of wisdom and this is the deeply aesthetic point of wisdom i've talked about wisdom as the virtue of being i'm sorry it's the beauty of virtue right um i i i want [1240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1240.88s)

people to understand reason and wisdom as this capacity to deeply listen yeah and this idea of developing relational skills is also like deeply tied to the whole idea of culture war because i don't see a way through kind of the divisions that we're seeing in society unless we really [1264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1264.72s)

understand where each other is coming from unless we really develop empathy and we're able to kind of appreciate what other people's perspectives are and that's all about relationality that's all about understanding and being able to really enter into a genuine relationship with each other [1278](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1278.24s)

um also what i'm seeing happening a lot because trump is now gone as this kind of bogey figure on the left and um is in a way i i see trump as kind of a distraction from a civil war on the left that was happening anyway between liberalism and what some people have called like council culture kind of a new ill [1302](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1302.64s)

illiberalism on the left this kind of and that that i think was delayed or distracted by like trump rode a lot of the wave of dissatisfaction with that cancel culture with wokeness and certainly was sort of able to articulate and push back against it because he just didn't didn't care like completely kind of hacked the system in that way [1328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1328.88s)

but now that he's out of the way i think that overdue and very tricky conversation of like when does um when does the left go too far when does it become cancel culture when is it a genuine concern about other people and when does it become a way of shutting other people down which is something that sarah ness i know has dealt with a lot in her workshops but now in my workshops i'm afraid to speak up about anything that might be against the kind of party line like if i don't ask people to identify their gender pronouns it's like you know a terrible thing even though people have different preferences around whether they even [1367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1367.6s)

like having a gender pronoun like some people feel discriminated against if they have to give a gender pronoun and others feel like they don't know whether they want to like buy into the ideology that comes along with gender pronouns but even having that discussion i've had a lot of you know kind of difficulty [1383](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1383.36s)

and um being seen like as as like a bad person instead of somebody that has a different view uh and so the the it feels like in scientific exchange where you have many different ideas but you can't talk about what the best idea is like there's an article i was reading that talks about how this is showing up in academia and [1401](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1401.52s)

how um professors or uh academians who are conservative are like something like 80 percent less likely to have their papers accepted and to have themselves recommended for promotion now because there's this huge liberalization of colleges and academic discourse and that completely squashes any sort of [1420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1420.48s)

kind of back and forth which is necessary to how we make sense of things it's necessary to how we debate and dialogue and find the answers um and so i and i really don't fully understand why it's happening like there are some kind of theories of well you know the internet has made it so we can find more people than ever [1443](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1443.279s)

that identify with our particular views and so maybe it's easier to have echo chambers because we make that identification and then like you know as more people come into that bubble it becomes harder to break away or maybe it's because of like the stress of covid that you know when we're in more stress and trauma we tend to want clearer um black and white like this is [1461](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1461.36s)

right and this is wrong you can see it even i think in the rise of superhero movies and the like well we don't want shades of grey you know like there is good and there is bad um but i think there has to be like more factors that are involved than that and it feels like one of the hugest things that scares me [1480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1480.24s)

right now um because even even in fears that i have like [[climate change]] if it becomes an identity politics issue if it becomes part of your identity to think that climate doesn't exist or to not do something about it then like all the academic discourse and all the facts in the world aren't going to change that another thing we focus on is this [1502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1502.88s)

concept of the shadow and so the shadow is actually a concept from jungian psychology which i found hugely useful just personally and looking at cultural dynamics so any aspect of ourselves we repress and deny so we kind of push into the basement of our unconscious and so we have [1520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1520.24s)

individual shadows we have collective shadows as well so and particularly why it's important for [[sensemaking]] is that the dynamic that jung described is that when you push cut some aspect of yourself off what happens is that it needs to be expressed somehow so you start seeing it where it isn't you start [1537](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1537.76s)

projecting it into other people so if you're like well i'm never angry i'm beyond anger i'm never i'd never get angry no i'm better than that when you have a natural anger response which is a healthy emotion shut it down start projecting it outwards and maybe you think everyone else is angry [1552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1552.72s)

or maybe you become passive-aggressive and everyone who meets you is like that guy so passive-aggressive but of course you can't see it and what's important is this the process of learning to integrate the shadows to learning to kind of bring it back into yourself and a lot of the cultural dynamics a lot of the kind of viciousness [1568](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1568.799s)

contempt that one side has for another a lot of the inability to have a conversation that's generative that actually go somewhere new is very often because people are talking to each other's projections rather than actually engaging with the person and doshin roshi is one of our faculty and he's he's known as the [1586](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1586.88s)

you know he's a zen master but he's known as the shadow roshi he really focuses on the shadow and also bringing in attachment theory for example so going into the kind of deep psychology of um what's going on we're making sense so we asked him as well what he's kind of busy with at the moment it's going to be a very long time before [1604](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1604.4s)

we have such a culture to support individuals on this path it seems we certainly don't have one now and all the wonderful things that rebel wisdom doing is it's creating a culture that makes sense out of things and the postmodern cultures that are so problematic because they are so prejudiced for making meaning and [1631](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1631.36s)

so prejudiced against making sense or liberation from conflict they're all about creating conflict this is not going to turn out well but what can you do well as an individual i can i can walk the path of awakening a culture can't walk a path a culture can't awaken groups don't awaken groups just talk about making sense or making meaning or about liberation but they can't liberate themselves and we can't see the culture we're in we can't we can't see the water we're swimming in it doesn't matter what level it is so as we all know we now have access to more knowledge than [1678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1678.72s)

we've ever had it's a bit like having the hitchhiker's guide in your pocket just just having a phone in your pocket and so a lot of knowledge is out there for us and what's rarer is a kind of shared experience so there's a difference between having knowledge and having experience i think that's what the value is of a [1698](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1698.399s)

process where we make sense together and also yeah of course get tuition from from the faculty we have a workbook etc which is really valuable and has all those different models and theories in there which we've spent a long time curating in such a way and pointing people towards further reading but again and again what the feedback [1716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1716.559s)

tends to be from the course is that shared experience of experimenting with different practices of actually having the conversation and thinking out loud with your own ideas with another human being who can go hmm okay interesting tell me more or yeah i kind of disagree with that you can't well it's certainly hard to find that on [[social media]] in text-based [[social media]] without it descending into some kind of um argument it's incredibly um useful powerful and really nourishing to have that process of engagement and have that um yeah that experience of making sense together and they're you know in the course people work in small pods of about you know three or four people [1754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1754.159s)

some of those pods are still going long after the first course ended i think that's a testament to the fact that that that is rare it's rare to find that kind of kind of conversation and it also relies in part in actually learning those practices which you then take out into your life uh elsewhere an amazing journey this has been and you [1773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1773.36s)

know in the words of like chit nat han the next buddha is the sangha and i think this is this is what it looks like and so first of all thank you and everyone for helping this magical create this magical space and time for us to think and thank you so much for those kinds of opportunities because i don't think there are a lot of us out here [1793](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1793.919s)

who understand what this transformative process is that we're undergoing and the more that we can understand and appreciate it and practice it the easier it will be to anchor it individually collectively and organically we all mentioned that the collective stance making aspect has been extremely imperative towards um well [1816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1816.24s)

this entire course i mean i really hope i can continue to meet many of you and keep meeting with my pod mates for uh for for a long time after this so thanks for watching everyone the next course starts on july 8th and you can read more about it in the link down in the show notes and we also have a limited amount of [1834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRV-ESY6Obs&t=1834.32s)
