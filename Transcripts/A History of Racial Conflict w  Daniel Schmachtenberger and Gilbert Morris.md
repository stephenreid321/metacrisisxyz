welcome everyone to this session on the stoa conversation between professor gilbert morris and myself thank you to peter limberg and the people at the stoa for letting us host this conversation here and for the community that will be engaging afterwards uh gilbert thank you so much for [28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=28.88s)

making this time you and i've had so many conversations on the way to this public conversation that have taught me so much um would love to hear your opening thoughts on our intention for this dialogue your intention uh thank you so much daniel and thank [49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=49.039s)

you to your colleagues at the stone um anytime that one can engage in a meaningful discussion about a great and important social issue that becomes important [66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=66.72s)

i myself believe in the marketplace of ideas as john stuart mill uh once called it and that is where there's a continuous dialogue moving back and forth on social issues without necessarily the intention to win an argument as much as understand its coordinates and so i'm pleased that we have that sort of uh relationship in exchange [91](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=91.68s)

so i welcome the opportunity for this discussion i'll share a bit of a long preface of my intention and hopes for this piece before we dive in because i asked for us to do this piece um actually we discussed we discussed what turned towards us doing this piece [119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=119.28s)

starting during the um george floyd protests which is quite some time ago now and have intended to do this ever since um so this is going to be a conversation on uh the topic of race racial inequality injustice the history of it and where understanding some of that history uh brings us to [143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=143.2s)

today in terms of framing up what possible better way of going forward might look like and um so for my side uh these are not the topics that i am schooled in that i was a student of in any deep more than just kind of cursory way as someone who's been [167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=167.12s)

interested in activism and human welfare in general and during the george floyd riots in particular uh protests i i was not mostly engaging in the deep scholarly work but the things that made it on their way to youtube so [186](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=186.159s)

i was seeing the public intellectuals and i saw um arguments from people like tonight coates or cornell west on one side people like thomas soule or glen lowdry on the other side and i didn't see what seemed like a bridge towards an agreement that was a way of moving forward i saw what seemed [208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=208.319s)

like arguments that landed for people who already resonated gave more intellectual support and ethical support for the people who resonated but that continued a kind of polarized approach and so i was really without being able to become a deep enough student in the topics to [228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=228.64s)

make sense of it myself wondering if there were any people who um had a sense of what a synthesis position between the various positions that might be able to uh help us forward look like and professor morris i'll call him gilbert throughout as he's asked me to and i had actually talked other topics previously [251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=251.2s)

regarding mostly um his work in the history and philosophy of ideas um history of philosophy legal scholarship related to some of my work on [[catastrophic risk]] and um but when we had discussed these topics and i knew he had actually been a [267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=267.04s)

director of racial studies at george mason university and taught and worked both in academic contexts and as an ambassador to many different countries around the world had both an american and international uh in a kind of legal and philosophical perspective um he was able to steal man all the various positions well here's how the libertarians would think of it and um here's how the critical theorists would think of it in a way that was like legitimately sharing their points of view very well and this was extremely valuable for me and so as as i was in this fortunate position [304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=304.479s)

to be getting uh educated on these topics by someone who could share the historical philosophical economic contextual perspectives and share the various different groups perspectives and how those perspectives had evolved over time i felt i was getting such a like invaluable [323](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=323.36s)

opportunity that i hope to be able to share with other people and so one of my aims in this was simply to be able to take a little bit of what i've got over dozens of conversations with gilbert and introduce that to other people who maybe like myself um care would like to understand are not already well educated and don't [344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=344.4s)

know how best to approach the topic so that's one of my goals the the goal that had us starting to talk originally was is there actually a way forward for how deeply entrenched the uh american racial injustice issues are and the various perspectives on it is there a way that could be anti-polarizing [367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=367.199s)

and i don't think we'll get all the way there in this conversation i think we'll lay groundwork because one of the other goals i that emerged for me is that i've done talks that have wound up adjacent on the internet to a bunch of anti-woke perspectives and uh that's strange for me i think it's because i'm interested in synthesis of different perspectives and a consensus approach and so i'll often uh try to explore a heterodox orthodox distinction and find the dialectic which put me in the heterodox camp which put me where the main trending heterodox thoughts are anti-woke [407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=407.36s)

and i'm super uncomfortable being in an anti-vocal camp is not my position and i would hope that and this is one of the reasons why i think the stow is a good place is that the people in the stowa are really interested in synthesis how do we explore the thesis of anything the antithesis the synthesis how do we explore more [427](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=427.039s)

clear nuanced trans ideological thought and peter lindberg's original work that helped launch it on mimetic tribes was can we actually inhabit everyone's memetic tribe and feel what the world feels like from their perspective so i'm hoping that after this dialogue the stoic community that chooses to engage with this will be able to have [447](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=447.68s)

deep rich dialogues about these topics and i know gilbert and myself are both happy to come back in and engage in those dialogues if it makes sense but i found so many people critiquing straw man's of the wok perspective or particularly unsavory aspects of how some people were expressing what they called woke [470](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=470.4s)

ideologies without seeming like they had ever steel man the underlying real issues of systemic inequality and systemic injustice where woke originally meant awake to systemic injustice and so i actually feel obliged to help to steelman that perspective to say before being anti-woke make sure you [490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=490.96s)

actually understand because otherwise you might be a very moral person taking a position that is immoral in ways you don't know because of the depth of the history so i think the main thing we're seeking to do here is to construct elements of the history and the critical pieces of philosophy and law [511](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=511.039s)

that happened some of the attendant economic elements to really get where the racial issue in the u.s is today what's unique about the us issue relative to other global issues so that then if someone wants to say well how do we better move this issue forward we at least have some better [529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=529.76s)

shared understanding of the history up to this point so that would be it for my intention of where we're here i i think that that's a that's an excellent that's an excellent introduction one of the things that i talked about when i lectured on this as you mentioned that uh george mason uh george mason is the most conservative uh if not one of the most conservative schools i served on that faculty with robert bork who i found to be an absolute genius kenneth starr was also on that faculty and so was karl rove and everyone knows walter williams the great uh great economist great [570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=570.16s)

personality and song at the same time roger wilkins was on that staff whose father was uh one of the founders of the urban league and uh for a time in uh menuenster so dr martin luther king jr and uh arandel phillip and so on so one had these two sides and coming from both a caribbean and a british perspective you can understand that um my i have been schooled in all these perspectives but being in the thick of it at that time um raised raised a great deal of questions not least of which they then appointed [610](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=610.8s)

me as as chairman of the african american studies department which meant that the knives were out should i step in the wrong direction or conceive the program in a manner not being conceived before but it was an excellent time with a bunch of great scholars professor jeffrey stewart rose trubin uh ben carson katya vladimirov and so you [633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=633.04s)

hear that already quite a diversified group of people teaching in the african american studies department and so i enjoy that kind of catholic uh in the in the small c sense that kind of catholic spread of ideas because it's consistent with js mills concept of the marketplace of ideas when i teach this subject i explain the overarching frame that we want to get is whether on the whole we are moving our behavior towards our values or our values towards our behavior because no matter what side of an equation you're on if you establish a set of values that you're not living up to [682](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=682.079s)

it is important for each group to [[exercise]] some self-policing and culpability to ensure that what we say about what we believe is what others can expect of us both in the way we continue to speak and certainly uh in our uh behavior [702](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=702.64s)

in addition to that the uh within that there's the christian virtue uh which when you talk about slavery and race that's relevant uh there is the legal issue which when you talk about human bondage and the removal of freedom that's an important issue i already mentioned the values [724](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=724.88s)

proposition and then there's an economic issue and some people say that the other three are inflected by uh the economic issue but we'll dive into that and see uh see where that goes the last point i'll make in this preliminary phase is that we must be careful about [745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=745.12s)

historical monumentalism and that is where we treat history as a monument to ourselves so that our status making and our sense of ourselves our sense of our own prestige requires history with a certain narrative no matter what the actual history is and when we come up against that [766](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=766.48s)

this is one of the ways in which you and i talk about this all the time daniel when someone may have a wrong perspective innocently and then if that person is curious and seeks a right perspective but when they are presented with the facts and still refuse either to engage on the facts raise questions or to change their position then this becomes disingenuous and that person is not an honest person with whom to speak in an effort to to solve social problem or at least generate some sort of understanding and so we have to esteem and reject monumental history and i'm afraid that both sides in to some degree have now gone to the extremes [813](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=813.04s)

of establishing history as a monument it's unassailable elements of the history cannot be questioned cannot be challenged uh because the historical narrative is so important to us in one way or the other that we can't bear criticism of it in any degree and that is both anti-human and anti-democratic [835](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=835.92s)

you're you're muted what you're saying about um viewing history as a monument to our current narrative and position is a special case of the general case of motivated reasoning and as you were kind of mentioning the economic case for slavery created a motivated reasoning basis for a whole bunch of weird gymnastics mental [867](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=867.44s)

gymnastics in terms of how to interpret christianity and how to interpret law and how to make the declaration of independence commensable with slavery and like really weird stuff so what we're seeking to do is to be able to look at which arguments are earnest but and they're partial they need [885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=885.44s)

reconciled versus actually hold on to their partiality and claim it to be more complete than it is out of motivated reasoning and the hope is to be able to strip the motivated reasoning have an earnest inquiry they can give us a clear enough sense of at least some through lines of the history up to this point and i think why this is so important why this is so important for me is and i'm really speaking to people who might be in a position somewhat like the position i found myself in a couple years ago when gilbert and i started speaking on this as i would hear people that knew more about [920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=920.079s)

the topic say things very differing from each other and i didn't feel that i had the knowledge to be able to say these people who put 20 or 30 years of study and they radically disagree with each other how am i going to figure that out and they would say things that sounded superficially compelling like people who would argue that [938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=938.48s)

uh mostly the issues of slavery and race are over and we should take more kind of libertarian perspective would say things like that as bad as slavery was genghis khan killed five times as many people in his own life as the entire atlantic slave trade ever even engaged with [955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=955.759s)

and there was some sense that slavery was just part of history everywhere and the american case was not all that particularly unique and um that you know we actually bought the slaves from african slave traders and you know those sound kind of compelling on the [972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=972.88s)

surface as i got deeper those all were either red herrings or specious or at least cherry picked in a way that really did not indicate the truth of the overall perspective well but simultaneously the critique of the american situation oftentimes cherry picks in the other [990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=990.72s)

direction in a way that doesn't acknowledge just kind of the real politic nastiness of humans largely and i really wanted to try to get a fair sense for that so i'm hoping um while mostly constructing what about the american slavery system and then post slavery the continuity of that all the way up to the current day where systemic [1013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1013.04s)

injustice associated with race and it must i just have to say we're not going to be dealing with the issue of the native americans we're not going to be dealing with the issues of feminism and intersectionality and biracial discrimination and the million nuances that are really critical that are just well beyond the scope of this [1031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1031.76s)

and for everyone who has that deeper background wonderful and this is really intended to be introductory um but the hope is an introductory pre-the american slavery situation to the american slavery through the post-slavery all the way up to current they can give some contexts of what is unique and uniquely problematic about this case that makes it so challenging yes and so with that uh i would say that first we have to keep slavery and race separate for the time being let them come together organically as the process goes and they will come together [1076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1076.96s)

and we will see that uh the slavery was the thing that seemed to be a forerunner and then race was brought in to to create certain justifications and even though slavery has ended by certain definitions the race issue continues uh in the most pernicious ways [1101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1101.36s)

so the beginning of that um if you look i think it's well established and and it's basic history that the reasons for slavery were war so if you were captive in the war uh debt if you had some [1121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1121.12s)

some some debt that you couldn't pay that these were the two main uh uh reasons uh why people found themselves enslaved there's a sociological and anthropological point to that and that is in the ancient tree if you go back as far as 32 3500 bc [1145](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1145.84s)

one of the things you find is that if you were engaged in war so there was a scrabble for resources and so on uh hunting grounds these sorts of things and if you were engaged in the war once you captured the people who who did not succeed the question was what to do with them they didn't have advanced sociology or [1172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1172.799s)

anything like that other cities to send them to and people became sensitive about slaughter you mentioned you meant genghis khan it was thought considerably that his own wives said to him at some point my god must you kill so many people you know slaughter entire cities and so on [1196](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1196.559s)

so if you're not going to slaughter them and you're going to integrate them and there's limited resources and there aren't other cities for them to go to slavery was the means of integrating them into one's society you see this greta roman situation where slaves rose to become important uh hold important political and official offices they rose in the [1221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1221.919s)

roman are setting to become great generals and where trusted aides and allies of the people who enslave them so slavery was never about the humanity of the person it was always about some sort of social process [1242](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1242.64s)

to integrate these people into our society if we did not wish to slaughter all of them that was very very crucial thing the change specifically specifically in the context where as a people that had just been dominated and captured loyalty was in question and so integrating them without some controls [1267](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1267.039s)

might have led to the breakdown of society yes the vanquish were not likely to be cooperative in the most uh meaningful ways and so once vanquished one had to pledge one's allegiance uh to the certainty of uh whomever suzerainty of the the vanquishing power [1287](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1287.679s)

one had to pledge to that now in in the politics book one and i'm not going to go into the excuse me the reference here it's very long but you can read people viewing can read michael sandell's aristotle's politics in the oxford [1312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1312.08s)

reader and you'll come to the same conclusion but you find it in book one of the politics where aristotle talks about natural slavery this has been a frustrating thing for both the aristotle and society and for aristotle scholars throughout history because they think it's a blemish on him [1330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1330.88s)

although he was a menu ancestor alexander the great who did abscond uh thinking that he would not meet the same fate as socrates um should things go badly so one can make an assessment of him that way but the question is when aristotle spoke [1349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1349.76s)

about natural slavery so his he made he sent two main points about five points but two main points that's about five paragraphs uh when he talks about this but he's really trying to set up the state and he's saying that the household and the individual are to the state as the arms and the legs [1370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1370.32s)

these are components and then he moves on to the individual and he wants to define how the individual acts as the arm or the leg you know of the state and he's worried because he says there's a certain type of individual who is a natural slave and this is someone who ought to be [1389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1389.6s)

this is a person who's given up his rational capacity and so that's one leg of it and the other leg is someone who refuses to labor there's a third leg where aristotle talks about our crazier accrazia means weakness of the will and that is when you know to do something right you tell yourself to do it and then you don't do it anyway [1412](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1412.32s)

right so aristotle said this is the weakness of the will it's our crazier and this is another type of self enslavement and so this natural slave the problem with this is it's kind of an open concept he is not really thinking of anyone he doesn't think about the in fact he [1431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1431.76s)

includes the africans in the asiatics so he says the asiatics are full of intelligence but no spirit the europeans are full of spirit but you know less intelligence and the barbarians have no intelligence for spirit and so they are natural slaves and so he's justifying you know the formation the building of [1454](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1454.0s)

empire in the greek setting so these are the people that he's referencing as he's thinking this and so his notion of natural slavery is that they haven't really created anything they are not interested in industrious and productive labor which is confusing because later on in [1471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1471.039s)

the politics he talks about you know agriculture and productive labor and then that's the necessity of putting slaves to work there anyway if i remember right he said he said something that really kind of shows the view of that the domesticated animal has a better spirit that's right yes because in the same way the domesticated beastly person is better [1492](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1492.48s)

off because the domesticated animal is acting within its own nature whereas the human being is not and so um uh this this the main thing that listeners should take away from this is it leaves an open sort of vessel into which people can put all sorts of [1513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1513.039s)

interpretations and say but aristotle said that right and we'll see that this this kind of has a through line all the way down from slavery to racism so and just to give the listeners context of the arc we're going to follow we're starting with aristotle and we're going to talk about the american case that doesn't come for a couple thousand [1534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1534.32s)

more years right right starting with aristotle because this was significant enough to the western canon of thought that it became something that got built upon absolutely absolutely no question about it now the second thing i should like to say is that slavery was always contested and so one of the things we must reject [1555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1555.12s)

is that slave holders in any period were just people of their times there were in every civilization where there was slavery as i said as we said before in prehistoric times uh uh it was a question of do we slaughter people or do we integrate them to society and if you think about let's say uh in china there's a there's a book or a set of narratives called the magical coulomb the magical coulomb is actually a chinese sort of national cartoon [[music]] it's a it's a series of texts mythology [1605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1605.84s)

and the central character is an african and this was uh i would say uh around 86 20 uh something like that that you had these uh that you had these stories uh in in china so they had a concept of they had slaves in china at the time but they didn't necessarily think racist and slavery went together so their sort of hero of their their thought mythological stories was a great jewel and you can read uh i think her name is belinsky uh julie i think julie wilinski is her name and she wrote about this extensively and then if you look at the indian situation uh in the grammatical [1655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1655.6s)

text the sudras and so on the slave master could not eat before he fed his faith there were rules about whether you could rape a slave and so on all these things were important and another thing for people to remember is the reason that you would want rules for slavery is everyone was susceptible being a slave so your country could get overrun you could be vanquished and you wanted to know at least if there were some rules in place to protect you uh if uh should you become a slave and so people the rules around slavery were very very strong of course they were violated many cases and so on but every major society had them and so that's very important [1699](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1699.279s)

once i just i hadn't thought of it quite this way what you're presenting is that the agreement on slaves is a very rawsian kind of thing saying i am making a position where if i end up being on the other side i'm okay with it because i might be on the other side because the power asymmetry is not so [1720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1720.799s)

perfect right whereas in the later case the power asymmetry became so severe that people stopped needing to consider they might be on the other side absolutely they they the the inherent superiority that they accorded to themselves meant that they didn't reflect on that at all and that's part of the what americans call the pushback that you're [1742](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1742.0s)

seeing when they are held to task for some of their behaviors that that that assumed superiority seems to uh seems to infiltrate their points of view so you have this situation with aristotle and so i made the point again that slavery was always contested so when we come into the uh the period [1765](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1765.52s)

uh what it's called the dark ages loads of writers uh what are called the patristic fathers generally around the pope and so on mystics and these sorts of people constantly railed against slavery and that has been true from that day to this that they were always constantly people making very very rich powerful arguments against slavery if we move quickly to saint thomas aquinas uh saint augustine thought that uh he agreed with aristotle they were natural slaves but if they had fallen away from god um uh some thomas aquinas in the somewhere theologica he makes this point also [1809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1809.76s)

agreeing with aristotle also agreed that uh if they've fallen away from god uh but then he says in the commentary on politics later on he says something like um there are those persons who are naturally masters and those persons who are naturally slave and they ought to know themselves well [1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1832.399s)

enough so someone who is not a natural master should not in fact present himself as a master over a slave because he will not have the internal character and proper conduct and so on and so that also becomes a useful sort of frame for people who want to uh want to justify enslavement so we've got these open frames there's one more open frame which is very interesting the moore's dominated spain for 800 years was thrown out finally in 1492 same year that columbus sailed out of grenada and so you're not likely and this is what tells you that race is a is a is a new is a new type of thinking not attached to any any profound history you're not likely to think yourself superior to some group of people that run your country for 800 years and given you all of your you know intellectual development your writing [1900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1900.08s)

your your your technological prowess your [[art]] [[music]] all these sorts of things not likely to think yourself superior to what happened is in spain people retreated to the mountains and built these small societies in the mountains and they eschewed sunlight and sought to become very pale to distinguish themselves from the moors [1927](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1927.6s)

and those who were mixed with the moons and so their their veins could be seen through their flesh and their veins were bluey and this is where the notion of blue blood came from at the same time the breeding of horses and so on became very very significant and this idea of the prestige of horses [1949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1949.279s)

based on breeding and the notion of a blue blood somehow got melded together and and so race this was already beginning to distinguish now race as a separate categorization uh for for human beings so those are the upper [1971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=1971.039s)

um framings that uh that we that we should work under and with those things in mind we can get now to uh to the issue of of uh enslavement the there had been slavery in on the continent of africa just as there was in europe both in uh the north coast the barbary coast was uh later called so that's tunisia and [2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2002.0s)

libya and all those places that you know morocco and so on and in sub-saharan africa right there they had been they had been slavery um and in this early period certainly um you had significantly large societies large societies up and down the what is called the swahili coast so that's the east coast of africa just off of madagascar all the way up to egypt running along the nile and all the way down to what is now tanzania and then somewhat inland inland as well so you had these great uh civilizations all of them had slaves for the same reasons debt and war uh very significant and if you think about uh um the center of africa on the north coast this is to say uh morocco mali these sorts of places these were where the greater [2076](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2076.56s)

kingdoms were located uh the most well known the portuguese began their incursion into these areas with the canary islands just off the coast just off the coast there and spent about 100 years wrestling with the dwellers on the canary islands to achieve control they [2098](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2098.8s)

would lose some wars when some they could go away for five or ten years come back they would and so this is a very very and this is we're talking between now uh the uh 14th uh uh century so the late uh uh 13th uh and throughout the 14th century they could not seem to get a um a hold uh here but eventually established a foothold in the canary islands and then attempted to make incursions uh into the mainland at the same time the spanish were observing this and observing you know the opportunities uh columbus was gearing up at the time to head out to uh [2148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2148.4s)

uh to what is called the new uh world new world for for europeans and what is very very significant in this period is that there was slavery was not the main driver when the portuguese and the spanish first began well they were all trying to to traverse the coast uh of after the west coast of africa all [2173](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2173.599s)

the way down to the cape um and this took uh about from the first incursion about 120 140 years to get done but slavery slaves were not the main focus gold was gold was the main focus uh and it's the main thing that made them start succeeding much better [2200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2200.64s)

than taking a hundred years to get a little bit of foothold mostly gunpowder revolution yeah um you what you had in in in west africa well you had many small kingdoms the arabs were the dominant [2219](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2219.2s)

uh uh a group up in the upper north uh of uh the continent of the time and trading routes between morocco spain the rest of the mediterranean and so on were already very well established uh had it's worth just noting the arabic uh influence in northern africa was already before what you're describing as the european influence coming into africa but it had many similar properties absolutely that's so what i'm saying is that the portuguese incursion into the canary islands while that occurred the the relationship [2266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2266.16s)

once the particularly the uh the moors once they left spain they entered all along the barbary cruise but largely into ethiopia and they began trading uh into the mediterranean from those countries not only slaves but all sorts of products that you know that were very important to europeans at the time very few agricultural products but large gold was one of the main things that everyone was in search of part of the reason was a king at the time called musa mensah right who was uh [2310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2310.839s)

there's a wonderful book i i thought i had it somewhere around here by howard french which is called born in blackness and it's a wonderful book to read uh to to get a sense of what was going on what is the real sort of argument being made here and by that book that history has kind of overshadowed this period and jumped straight to christopher columbus and the raiding of the african coast for slaves but they've missed about 200 years of open trade for gold during the 13th and the 14th century excuse me so if you look along the coast there was a place called elmina which is in modern day ghana which the portuguese eventually found and there they were able to correct much of their fiscal problems and most of their economic problems and they saw an economic expansion and economic boom [2389](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2389.599s)

uh from dealing gold from el miner where they built their first port as well uh their minor castle um and this was in this was so this was this completed the search for forward when i say complete i don't mean that that was the end of it i mean that finally they found what they what they were [2409](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2409.2s)

looking for the the association with slavery and enslavement of uh blacks didn't come organically out of that situation henry the navigator uh was the the brother i believe of the king alfonso of portugal and henry the navigator hit upon an idea uh where he thought he needed he thought that there was a an opportunity in trading in african slaves enslaved from the continent of africa it wasn't called [2457](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2457.28s)

africa at the time he was concerned with that because he saw from the canary islands that the plantation construct that they had there was insufficiently uh developed so then he began to plead with uh the popes [2481](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2481.599s)

because he recognized that the king of portugal could not give him dominion over these lands there could be a declaration but in order to get a real declaration and prevent other catholic powers from incurring into these lands and to give himself a monopoly that uh that he needed the popes [2504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2504.319s)

in premature so he was the first to have gone to poke eugene uh i think it's like 14 18 and and to convince pope eugene that saracens basically muslims uh were lurking all throughout uh the west coast of africa and that he needed uh to form [2528](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2528.72s)

what was called uh the army of christ to to go and proselytize to the africans and get rid of the saracens completely untrue but eugene issued the bull i think it's called sane charissimus sane charissimus and that was the first [2557](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2557.2s)

papal bull aimed at identifying um africa not yet for slavery but putting um the portuguese and henry the navigator in particular uh on this trek for incurring into the continent itself [2578](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2578.56s)

uh beyond the the search for gold and for those who aren't familiar papal bull simply means a dictate of the pope which is a take a significant thing during that time um you're mentioning the content of afric continent of africa and you're mentioning that it wasn't called africa and this um very kind of specious notion of they sold their brothers into slavery which assumes that this giant continent that china and and the us and many other countries would all fit on is just this one thing maybe speak to that for a moment because i think that helps to start to frame for people who haven't thought of it um a bit about the history yes um the it's fascinating some degree there were hosts of small kingdoms along the west coast of africa at the time the continent of africa and none of those people could see [2646](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2646.56s)

themselves as africans so to speak um this appellation came much later when uh europeans could not be bothered to learn the particulars or specifics of their assemblages and merely sort of referred to everyone by the continental by this continental capsule [2673](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2673.839s)

and so there is a deep sense in which one can't possibly the notion of brotherhood that the idea that there was a brotherhood amongst them that is an unfortunate notion i will say that um henry the navigator learned the lesson he actually learned [2692](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2692.88s)

it in his lifetime i think he died in 1460 but in his lifetime in dealing with the kingdom of benin now when he went to benin he met a magnificent wall city right a magnificent wall city with great metal work and [[art]] and a king that it took him almost six months to get an appointment so to speak [2720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2720.0s)

because they did their due diligence right they he you didn't have the freedom so so two things you didn't have the brotherhood and while you had some some raiding that went on in the earliest phases you're not going to move 12.4 million people by by chasing them around uh the coast of [2741](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2741.52s)

africa so they went to benin benin drove a very hard bargain was a very significant uh uh civilization at the time had its own [[art]] had its own culture its own [[music]] um he wrote about the hospitality of the royal court and that one could not see the king at [2763](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2763.839s)

will and that there was a process uh involved why is this important because when we come to the racial argument the racial argument is that there was nothing there anyway so why find a slavery [2783](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2783.68s)

enslavement so abominable here's a racial argument that categorizes all these people that have been around for all this time and say that they have never amalgamated into anything significant and they have no great accomplishments so that i just want to add to this that it is not necessary that someone has [2804](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2804.079s)

advanced metal work in giant walled cities to say that uh their life is worth something and should not be taken by force ethically um i think the hobsian idea that pre-advanced civilization people historically had these short brutish nasty mean lives in a war of all against all is just [2827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2827.119s)

absolute apologism for the narrative of progress as defined right if we look at the kalahari or mini of the bush or whatever that didn't have the great walled cities some of them had types of [[art]] and poetry and wisdom that is mind-blowing yeah so i i wouldn't want to make the [2847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2847.359s)

argument their lives are worth something because they had advanced technology worth noting yeah that is a part of the history yeah but it's well it's it's worth noting in this way as well that is the european definition of an advanced society and the point that i'm making is not that i think that makes them advanced but the very people who accuse them of not being advanced categorize them as not being advanced when they encountered them met them with these implements of civilization that they themselves prioritized and so that is very significant you're absolutely right if you take the same [2889](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2889.52s)

people people use refer to them as the bushmen of the killahari they have no great structures but if you want a phd in linguistics today you'd better be going to them to learn one of their clicking languages or the messiah who can control you know 200 head of cattle with their [2910](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2910.0s)

inter-species linguistics and so on so those are not great buildings but those are actual processes that now human beings want to use and in fact it's people in the machine learning and ai area so the most advanced western um disciplines who are going into these places now [2933](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=2933.599s)

uh to study the linguistics of these ancient uh ancient people so you're absolutely right and i wouldn't want to leave that impression and i i think it's a good uh it's a good point to make in addition to that i will say this though that for those who thought that great civilization were important there's a sort of dishonesty about about this because the framing of uh people at that time on the african continent was that they were not advanced yet you know we see as i say diplomacy we've been in and then benin finally cut off the portuguese for slaves and cut off their trading with the portuguese no no argument just they were self-sustained and self-satisfied and so on and did not feel that they gained any advantage by dealing with the portuguese and this is what gave uh henry the navigator the idea that he had to come up with another another concept and needed another papal bull but before we get to that for those of you listeners who want to review the case you can look at the pre-egyptian societies in the sudan as examples of one type of civilization so to speak [3022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3022.4s)

you can look at uh places like bola whale or the great zimbabwe uh an area called you can look it up great zimbabwe right in what is now zimbabwe so all the way down the nile and then uh below the limpopo river and so on you can see uh great civilizations which existed uh long before [3049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3049.28s)

uh the european the european uh incursion uh schroder is another great city something called the swahili construct which is a series of uh swahili speaking and uh uh countries or or small kingdoms along the east coast in what is now tanzania that that entire area so for those persons who believe [3077](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3077.599s)

as you pointed out and in a kind of hobbesianism that that these kinds of societies were where not only examples of progress and other philosophers can't humor all believed that these were this was an example you know writing systems big buildings [[art]] you know all these sorts of things this was proof of of civilization and i'm saying that proof was there that proof it was ignored uh and this is the second great deception so we said the first great deception is is uh henry the navigator attempting in some way to uh uh to ingratiate himself to [3125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3125.52s)

uh to the popes and the if you think about uh uh this period in uh european history uh pope he goes to then to pope martin and he gets another um uh he gets another uh henry the navigator gets another um people bull this time that specifically gives the concession to the portuguese king as opposed to the spanish king and these bulls come all the way down to to uh in in in 1444 [3171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3171.92s)

there is a what would be called a treaty and this tree he lays out because of the paper bulls now they're free to do business and this treaty lays out all the dominion now of the portuguese of the portuguese side and then in uh i think it was um [3197](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3197.68s)

uh 1455 that uh you get the uh the papal bull that changes everything that literally gives portugal the right to enslave people from the african continent in perpetuity and then the final this i think is a [3222](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3222.079s)

critical piece as you had mentioned that historically uh many cultures including european cultures enslaving other european cultures where there was no difference of race um greek enslaving greeks um that the main reasons for enslavement were either debt so like a peonage enslavement system [3243](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3243.44s)

some types of crime um where that was a punishment to kind of work the crime off and war but that unlike this later system there were limits on that slavery and you were starting to mention some things of limits of rape and like that but there was also that it was not a forever system that's right that's right and i i [3262](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3262.64s)

want to make sure that you make that clear so that the the kind of rights that one one kingdom inside of the continent of africa may have had with a warring tribe that they conquered inside the continent of africa who would not have both considered themselves africans any more than two european groups at war would [3282](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3282.4s)

have themselves europeans they would have been you know vikings and frenchmen or whatever it was um that they would have had binds on what that slavery was that when those slaves sold changed completely and i think that's one of the key cases we're [3300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3300.72s)

building well that you're precisely right about that and the the papal bull which changed everything uh was called romanus pontifex in 1455 and now and there are a couple of things to say about that number one [3326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3326.319s)

it became international law because the the spanish kingdom sorry the portuguese kingdom lived in a competitive area of the world and it became international law and as a side note you can kind of understand henry the eighth when he uh destabilizes or disestablishes the catholic church in the uk this frees him from the international law imposed on spain and the other catholic powers uh in respect of portugal so that's something to bear in mind and that's important to bear in mind [3369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3369.28s)

uh because of the relationship between elizabeth the first and her pirate is who end up fighting the spain on fighting stain on open waters and capturing slaves to bring them to the united states but before we get there so romanus pontifex happens and this produces essentially a free-for-all [3394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3394.96s)

and as you said i just want to make sure we we close that point and that is do not if you're thinking africans sold their brothers for slavery if you happen to be black and you think that this is the wrong idea they didn't know each other in the way that we talk about if you're from the caribbean if you're from you know wherever it is that you're brothers or if you have a white friend who's close to you and you two share you know you say that's my brother that that didn't exist in that way they didn't know each other they never referred to each other as africans you [3440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3440.16s)

referred to yourself within the context of your particular tribe the mobility of which unlike say the sand people right who had been part of the great migration 1500 years ago you know from near mali and morocco all the way down to the horn of africa most of the tribes were not peripatetic right you had the [3462](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3462.4s)

the bedouins and the berbers and so on up in the north but for the most part in the sub-sahara uh they were not peripheral they were gathered around watering holes largely or the ocean and that's where people lived and so on and they you know africa is vast so they lived you know millions of miles from one another and if you look at the [3484](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3484.72s)

footprint of where slavery where where the slaves came from you're looking at places that are now sort of uh between guinea-bissau right senegal that area all the way down to angola so this is a very small small footprinted area [3507](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3507.28s)

um and uh i mean the the arab trade and slave was many times larger many many times larger the difference here was you are being enslaved outside of a historical context with a new set of people under a chattel framework all right [3529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3529.76s)

uh that didn't allow strangeness may sound uh people who were enslaved in the in that that arab logistical corridor in uh west africa was sometimes sold to other africans in the north but still in africa right egypt tunisia you know these sorts of places morocco [3555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3555.04s)

and so on so there was a chance that they could return to their to their home you could trick where you were going to uh as people would have seen from the amishad is a wonderful scene in the film where when the uh the enslaved is asked where are you from and the gentleman steps back a little bit he steps back [3576](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3576.0s)

all the way into the shadows until he disappears and he says this is where i'm from and so the i thought that was an interesting uh way to to to depict the psychological impact of someone now inferring the newness of the place that they have now encountered by by by force [3598](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3598.96s)

so that's an important thing to note uh the other thing to note is that once romanus pontifex is taking place what we usually call the slave trade we have to change really change our reference point uh to that this was a guns four slaves four commodities trade so you bring the guns small tribal kingdoms you you meet the first tribal kingdom of course i'm i'm just giving a scenario here that tribal leader says no i don't want your weapons you know [3647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3647.839s)

i don't want to kill people i don't i don't really want to do that you go to the next one you say listen he bought a lot of guns from me so he's going to attack you you'd better buy guns from me to protect yourself so first it becomes a protection thing so you have this uh multiple trap that you find yourself [3668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3668.079s)

caught in which you uh [[dance]] yes go on this important to just underscore um so as we're going as the gunpowder revolution is kind of advancing and it's advancing disproportionately more in europe than it is in africa absolutely from this like 1300 to 1600 time period right the asymmetry in [3689](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3689.839s)

weaponry is becoming much more significant so where um the spaniards or the portuguese might have taken a long time to make a certain degree of progress once the british really got involved coming in and they were coming with lots of effective ballistics that's right changed everything completely [3713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3713.04s)

and then it's really a racket that they're doing because they're like we sell guns to one side of a rival rival tribe and then go to the other ones and say you have to have them to protect yourselves right but it's basically a protection racket that we drove by introducing asymmetric weapons right and so they have to get weapons and then they trade us these slaves for [3734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3734.72s)

the weapons right obviously what the rest of it is but that's another thing where it's like they didn't really have a choice because as a moment that we introduced that degree of asymmetric weaponry between tribes that might war with each other but have a certain binding on the ethics of their war with each other based on long historical context we break their [3754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3754.64s)

whole historical context and force them into our terms that's right and so now they can't survive without without these weapons and so it moves from a protection thing to an ambition to a status making proposition so it's no longer about protection now rival tribes want the guns because they want to be larger [3781](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3781.599s)

so they don't they don't want it for protection anymore it's now part of an ambition it seems like there is this through line right protection and necessity into ambition because the ambition is to get ahead of them of the race the [[arms race]] yes but if you weren't trying to get ahead of it you could forecast you would definitely lose at it because the other [3803](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3803.28s)

guy's trying to get ahead yes absolutely no the the the the the multiple trap remains as an animating force in all the relationships at that point and so this begins and the other thing that uh the viewers might wish to to think about and uh you mentioned betty wood who wrote a [3824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3824.799s)

wonderful book which neither of us can remember the name of but we love it so much a very small book maybe 120 pages on um slavery in colonial america and uh beautiful book and this is one of the things she points out she does she's a careful enough scholar to think about the change to the [3848](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3848.4s)

anthropology sociology and psychology of the people from the african continent when they are put into this mix so the origins of american slavery yes absolutely so if we're speaking uh at the moment about uh uh people on the continent and we're accusing them and some countries angola has apologized to um um in 2016 africa has five regions north south east west central and uh 54 countries well by resolution the african union uh in uh in in 2016 created a a sixth region and a 55th country called [3900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3900.0s)

the um the country of the diaspora now there's an argument there that every human being is a member of this diaspora right because you can and this is the some of the conflict we have when people make these arguments on the one hand you say everyone is from africa but when we say the diaspora we're speaking in national terms which were invented by the colonialists right denying mother africa so to speak a full panoply of humanity which uh which should be assigned to so anyway that was done and uh the idea there [3946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3946.559s)

during that period angola and about four other countries apologized to the diaspora for selling them but they used the language of a brotherhood and they didn't seem to recognize or didn't seem to argue and this this gets the reason now some people will say well i think that's nice or i think that you know that's gracious or you know whatever have you yes [3970](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3970.72s)

but we should always try to get history in in its proper context because the narrative that we use at that end is going to bleed through when it's come time for the solutions and then we'll have a very difficult time sort of crafting the solutions if we're depending on a narrative which while it feels good is actually inaccurate [3994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=3994.319s)

you know so this is this is profoundly important so so you have that situation now you have the rivalrous situations of you know kingdom against kingdom and so on and uh uh you now have the uh the slave trade everybody knows about the slave trade uh uh and uh the ex but now we know about the guns [4022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4022.319s)

for commodities for slaves and commodities and so on in a triangle that uh that that moved people uh 12 and a half million people to the united states what was that america um but it moved close to uh four or five times that uh to places like brazil the starting point was actually one of [4045](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4045.76s)

the main starting points was nevis where alexander hamilton was born and then barbados which was a very significant plantation and then jamaica and these were largely so so human beings arrived in these places as cargo sugar was the main thing that left right sugar was the main thing in the united states was cotton and then tobacco right so these were the commodities that were the most uh uh the most uh important and so it then uh cycled to jamaica and then uh of course uh nassau was impossible to either maintain [4091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4091.119s)

slavery or maintain plantations or maintain anything since it's mostly limestone and very shallow and the the because it's very shallow and very low to the sea level uh you don't have very good soil for any kind of growing and so it became a pastoral colony uh and as people have seen i'll reference the film again just in case [4114](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4114.799s)

people haven't read the books but pirates of the caribbean you see that the fight for nassau is uh uh mostly piracy uh because of the arc of the archipelago that those islands are and then haiti st domingo was the big had 36 000 plantations haiti [4135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4135.92s)

did and this was run by the french and so you see the caribbean was was split into these various areas uh as well and all the european powers had their little dominions constant fights between the french and the the spanish even though in in 14 in the 1490s a treaty was made called the post line the pope's line and in the pope's line because the portuguese the spanish had said to the pope how we are members of the church as well how can you give all this dominion to portugal and leave us out of the equation they then divided up uh things between themselves uh and uh um what is now north america was [4185](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4185.759s)

spanish at first north america and then uh uh south america was portuguese at least brazil was and then smack rings the british were sort of picking off small places around the caribbean and this is how the uh the structure was developed [4208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4208.239s)

the salient period or the salient moment was the arrival of some people in in uh in 1619 into the american setting now there have been lots of discussions about that about whether or not uh this was the first landing of slaves this is actually quite a complex [4235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4235.44s)

quite complex complex situation and it and i mentioned all this stuff about uh the europeans and what's going on and kids nevis what's going on in barbados jamaica right the united states a unique legal situation going on i wrote an [4259](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4259.199s)

essay about the reception of english common law into the 13 colonies and it was one of the most complex jurisprudential documents you know to put together uh because for instance while it was a british america was was british uh the difficulty was that british law [4286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4286.48s)

was made and basically imposed in the colonies by the lord proprietors who were given grants by the king so america was not seen as part of the jurisprudence of britain going up to their to their privy council which is part of [4306](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4306.96s)

the house of lords so going up to their high courts and so on this is very very important and so in 1619 you have a ship uh sorry you have at the time a governor called governor i think it's argill who is the governor of [4328](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4328.88s)

jamestown and uh but there are two fiends uh one is a cousin to the palace uh his name is hawkins and the other one is warwick and they are a pirate ears who conspire and they say wait the situation is anomalous so [4351](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4351.04s)

there's a war going on you've got the spanish using dutch ships but the british are at war against spain largely because spain's dominion given to them by the pope does not apply to britain so and then we are british north america so what we can do is we can raid spanish ships and appear to be fighting spain which means that our british king will not find us offensive and then whatever happens with the cargo we get paid because nobody's going to argue if we bring cargo of value into this new american setting and so this is how [4399](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4399.44s)

these uh 20 plus odd as it was described in a letter uh persons arrived uh black persons uh from the continent of africa arrived now here's the thing they were not slaves in the legal sense they couldn't be because they were baptized [4422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4422.4s)

and under english law no christian could be enslaved you had a similar thing in france with the code noir which created all the problems of haiti because it wasn't christian though the french were a little bit more personal about it if you were french you could not be enslaved so uh so each country as i say had these [4444](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4444.719s)

little uh uh niches of legal and jurisprudential uh uh limitations that could be exploited and so these people were landed they were indentured so for all intents and purposes they were enslaved because they couldn't go anywhere they couldn't buy their passages away they couldn't [4471](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4471.44s)

escape they put none of that and so there they were on this landscape uh now in this new setting and many of them negotiated indentured contracts and things of that sort uh and and they were accommodated because nobody intended at the time that they should be slaves in perpetuity [4494](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4494.64s)

there were already growing free blacks in uh in america at the time and one free black became very very important to this story now as i said for those of the listeners who are thinking to themselves but surely they felt they must have those those 20 plus odd blacks must have felt like slaves right they wherever they came from they were either sold the slaves or stolen kidnapped so that's one they take they didn't look on you know hawkings or warwick and say to themselves oh my god rescue when they were taken uh to [4543](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4543.28s)

to uh to america what they would have found that uh there was a kind of benign uh non-agency that they experienced there but they could negotiate uh terms of their labor they had times to work and all that kind of thing on the regular indentured contract now there are some things to note [4570](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4570.48s)

the indentured service program had occurred uh about 16 to 18 years before in england in 1601 they had passed what are called the poor laws and the poor laws were kind of an [4595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4595.76s)

apprenticeship law and this shows you how the anomalous nature of the application of law at the time to get people off the streets and get them into productive labor so the routine was that someone could they had to volunteer to become an apprentice [4619](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4619.28s)

if they didn't volunteer if you were a prisoner you were just made an apprentice to make yourself productive in society right if they didn't send you to australia first right and uh um what eventually happened was people were just being kidnapped off the [4637](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4637.12s)

street and they and then we're talking about europeans you know we're kidnapped off the street and put it because the the profiteers could and private they they could argue that they were following the poor laws so the indentured program was itself um if you like uh problematic from the very beginning so it was not a safe position to be in and therefore changes to that position were not difficult to contemplate and in the 17th century in the united [4684](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4684.8s)

states from about 1639 to 1690 the life of blacks in america changed completely absolutely and completely and this began there were little skirmishes here and there but the real situation was anthony johnson a uh a uh well you had john punch and john punch was an indentured servant uh and he ran away [4730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4730.4s)

along with two europeans and when they were caught the europeans were punished by having their indenture extended and he was made to serve indefinitely that's the key thing indefinitely [4755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4755.6s)

in 1655 a black man named anthony johnson had a white and a black indenture and they left to begin another service and johnson was saying no i have the right to their service [4784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4784.4s)

and the courts ruled that in the case of the john juan john casor c-a-s-o-r that anthony johnson had the right to his service for life between that period and 1690 you had a transition uh um rights of blacks or privileges if you [4827](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4827.36s)

want to call them that were being taken away so uh they couldn't own property so that that changed the uh the status of the mother became the status of the child and that locked in [4852](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4852.0s)

lifetime servitude for children the reason for that is because i i actually refer to it as the free rape strategy because if you raped a woman before then the children were yours as per the the french situation but this was the opposite of the code noah [4876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4876.159s)

because it said that the the status of the child passed through the mother and this meant that if the mother was enslaved that the child was enslaved but then if the mother was white in denture that the child was indentured as well so there was no escape and and you saw [4896](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4896.159s)

that so the shackles anti-freedom the loss of liberty was growing by a progression what what what financial people call stacking there was a stacking going on so just to recap a couple things with regard to this question of multiracial kids if a white man and a black woman had a baby versus if a black man a white woman had a baby how do you deal with it when that law got formalized that it's the status of the mother there is now a situation where um if there was a black female slave all of her children including by rape including by whether [4944](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4944.159s)

from black men or white men would all be owned by whoever owned her absolutely now incentivizing the maximum amount of rape was highly profitable because you could either use those slaves or sell them absolutely and to just get a sense of like how mind-blowingly gruesome that is and then to go back and say you're making a case that is exactly the [4969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4969.6s)

opposite of the hubsan case and exactly opposite of the kind of pinker way of thinking about things which is the history got progressively better that it's always been nasty and yes there were nasty things in the past but like i think a lot of people who don't have a deep study of history who grew up in the united states think [4988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=4988.96s)

before 18 before the emancipation proclamation just seems like ancient history like some before 1776 like why would anyone even go go back that far and that there was probably worse slavery they jump straight to genghis khan type examples and assume that it was bad but it's been getting progressively better and you're actually painting an opposite story in [5011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5011.199s)

which case the slavery was way less bad and got progressively worse and there was a process codifying slavery in america and then in the americas the caribbean and the americas and then specifically slavery in the united states and then specifically black slavery as opposed to other forms of non-racial slavery in the united states that became [5033](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5033.92s)

um discontinuous with the way that most slavery practices historically had been right and much worse where it would reify because it needed some continuity it reified a version of aristotle and a version of papal bowls but like the worst ones with the worst motivated reasoning that now had nothing to do with the captures of war and had [5054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5054.8s)

nothing to do with debt and had everything to do with a permanent breeding labor class for economic competition right and that's the point that i think is really critical that you're constructing and if anyone is just [5071](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5071.28s)

getting lost in the fact that it's a lot of details and obviously for every detail that gilbert is sharing there's a thousand relevant ones that he's you know trying to uh avoid you know that are important is that the american slavery case and the u.s slavery case and the racialization of the slavery is actually unique and particularly [5091](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5091.84s)

problematic and so i want we're going to continue on that arc right wanting to kind of brush stroke where we're going absolutely i think that's a fantastic way of uh of seeing it and and the reason is because here's some head swinging some head swinging propositions to make the case about [5115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5115.199s)

how slavery america the american version survived because now race race has become central to the question we're now defining a specific set of people as non-human now where does that come from lower than human what does that come from so [5138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5138.48s)

in 1570 abraham ortillas creates a map cartography was growing because the and and here's the thing people talk about the value whether slavery produced enslavement produced value you wouldn't have had global shipping were it not for enslavement [5163](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5163.52s)

so cartography grew in many respects i'm not going to say it's absolute but there's a wonderful book by a fellow i think his name is david emmer emeraw or something anyway he wrote a book called how to hide an empire i can't remember his name um a beautiful book amazing book and he demonstrates that the cartography of the [5190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5190.4s)

united states is almost completely motivated by race almost the reason that they don't take all of mexico is because they were like there's too many brown people there let's take this portion and that's enough right the reason that puerto rico has one status and hawaii has another is because [5211](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5211.12s)

there were more caucasians in hawaii at the time compared to puerto rico where you had this massive group of brown people which uh whose behavior were unscrutable uh so you you have these issues now but abraham ortilius when he makes this map he he he has artwork you know uh people [5235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5235.76s)

will know if you if you if you if you if you live in the uk if you go to university in the uk the books the great texts even darwin's origin of species they have something in it called a frontal piece which is like a beautiful [5254](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5254.0s)

decorated page with a dedication to the king or something like that with ornate um artwork all around it so here this map did not take the entire page just two circles and then excuse me on the top of the map this europa and the bull right the bull of europa and a lady a beautiful elegant lady looks like uh botticelli's venus or something like that and then over on the other side is the asiatic and they have someone representing all women [5296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5296.32s)

there's a woman representing her and she's in beautiful colors like wearing a you know traditional dress and and then they have the the india and then they have africa at the bottom what's significant is africa is at the bottom so already this map is beginning to say [5320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5320.159s)

it's filling in the aristotle and the aquinas you know this open category that they've left based on civilizational advancement and all these sorts of things plus there's the dominance that's going on in west africa at the moment and nobody is saying hey [5344](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5344.32s)

it's a guns for the enslave for commodities trade and there's a rivalrous proposition that's being exacerbated on the continent so they're not actually losing or they're not actually just a bunch of disagreeable people who can't behave something is happening to them no one says that it just says those [5369](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5369.52s)

people are always warring and so on killing each other but here we are you know living in a a great civilization and so we have advanced more than they have because again you know here we are then how does this get refined who what happens here well it turns out that david hume part of the scottish enlightenment right great philosopher david hume it tells a story that a man is said to be very intelligent but the fact that he is black is a clear proof that he is merely parroting what he's [5417](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5417.199s)

heard before now this is a this is coming from not some vicar you know in burmanze you know in britain this is david hill friend of adam smith friend of thomas reid who i think jefferson read more than he [5439](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5439.199s)

read hume actually orlock um friend of uh dr johnson and understand this dr johnson had a ward a young man who when he died dr johnson left all of his books and all of his money to this young black man so it's not like hume [5464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5464.88s)

was estranged from the experience in fact when hume died he was an atheist and dr johnson who was a terrible wit went to see him to ask him whether or not he believed in god now he was going to hell and hume gracious even unto death aristocratic even unto death so they knew each other that way so and johnson did not treat this young man like a slave he was as well dressed as johnson he educated him all these sorts of things so is it that that hume looked at and said well he's just parroting johnson or is it that he just believed that in a [5509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5509.52s)

general sense but either way he wrote it no you don't understand and i'm not sure if you can tell me i don't understand how after they knew of the pyramids in egypt and they knew of the whatever they knew of the great nile traditions how they could say something like that because they they were in some ways i mean obviously there was some gruesome motivated reasoning but they were also trying to be men of natural philosophy and science and the architecture that is involved in those buildings obviously did not come from parroting white people and [5555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5555.199s)

involves very very complex uh science how how did they think that well this is what's really interesting is that the enlightened voices at the time would say things like it's not a question of whether we built better buildings than they did david buildings that were suitable to their environment and we built the ones [5580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5580.08s)

suitable to our environment but they got things from us and we got things from them down in in in great they the great zimbabwe they were influenced by by egyptian architecture but egyptians were influenced by sudanese right so so and all of them [5605](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5605.679s)

were counter-influenced in later years by europeans and that kind of thing so human history really is a knitting together a confluence of influences rather than any self-generated influence such as we like to think of the lonely artist who just comes up with genius on his own right you can just look at the work of [5630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5630.48s)

picasso and know that that's not true so hume i don't want to paint a bad picture of you i want people to just know what he said and understand it now when i was teaching uh in the african american studies department in george mason i didn't teach anything particularly african-american so to speak because it was my view that all of human history belonged to all human beings so if i teach hume a student then says to me [5674](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5674.0s)

how can you teach that racist dead white male my point is well is that an argument against him you can say he was naughty or terrible or whatever heavy that's not an argument the real argument against him is in hume's philosophy which is an anti-epistemological philosophy meaning [5697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5697.32s)

hume didn't think it's much more complex than i'm going to say but hume didn't think we could justify our knowledge he was a skeptic right so that means hume believed that you could not buy induction meaning looking at something know anything [5718](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5718.32s)

bertrand russell who is very funny and in his great big book which you know when i was the boy i read that book maybe 10 or 11 times uh the history of western philosophy because it was so funny he has so many funny moments in there and he says what hume is basically saying is but if you eat an apple every day and it tastes like an apple [5744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5744.4s)

that's no guarantee that tomorrow when you bite the apple it won't taste like meat right and then he wrote another book the abcs of relativity where he's talking about the subatomic world and how the table appears smooth but really the table has mountains and crevices [5764](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5764.8s)

at you know the subatomic level and so and it's splitting apart and rotting and you know all these kinds of things which you cannot see or experience so basically what he's saying about him is the core of hume's philosophy is that you cannot secure your knowledge by saying that you experienced it you experienced x [5789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5789.12s)

but here is hume listening to someone speaking and deciding absolutely that person's capacity and his complete humanity not just him but the entire race to which he belongs that's the argument against you that he offended his own philosophical treaties and that's how we have to argue [5817](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5817.6s)

in the you don't have to say he's a terrible man he's a dead white male and so on we have to do is to be able to look at his core arguments and say his arguments may be valid on the philosophical side but in fact he offended them and therefore he must be put to the question hume scholars must be put to [5839](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5839.28s)

the question why don't they write about that as a significant breach of his own theory right so there's a there's a performative contradiction right which he's an extreme epistemic skeptic in most contexts so any place where he makes a definitive statement would seem to go against a general grain of his epistemic skepticism absolutely [5862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5862.4s)

yes and he makes a very definitive statement about the cognitive capabilities and dispositions of uh people with black skin or african descent or however he described it and so you can't know about apples but you can know about black people and so then one has to say if he is rationally thinking about the [5886](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5886.159s)

limits of epistemology and comes up with his general view why then does he violate it with this performative contradiction in this area is there some deep motivated reasoning or some identity complex or something that has him be against himself in this way right right no it is it raises quite quite quite deep and profound questions the same thing unfortunately applies to [5907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5907.44s)

kant who many people will argue that aristotle can't the two greatest western philosophers that ever there were and can't says there is a man who is black from head to toe and this alone is a clear proof that he [5930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5930.0s)

is stupid so it's a it's a stunning you know there's no escape you don't have any room to convince this person of another thing why is this important kant actually teaches he's a philosopher but in those days geography had the role of sociology and some elements of history [5955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5955.679s)

and he taught geography for his entire career so kant would have seen the ortelius map and all the other cartography which followed ortelius abraham ortelius after 1570 and kant makes this statement similar to humes that that merely knowing that this man is [5978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=5978.88s)

black you can already conclude so basically this is a priori knowledge which according to his philosophy is impossible to know from mere induction from mere observation now what's really significant there [6003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6003.04s)

uh is this khan not only offends his epistemological thesis he also offends he and john locke have come to the same conclusion that the subjugation of the negro is appropriate because uh he has come essentially come from a [6030](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6030.719s)

culture and can't write this in his essay the sublime and the beautiful everybody every philosopher wrote essays like that sublime in the beautiful it's part of the critique of judgment uh so judgment is the estimation of things and so on and uh but khan has something called the categorical imperative [6050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6050.88s)

and it has two planks one plank is treat others in such a manner that if you universalize that treatment the world would be a better place so behave towards others in such a way that if everybody behaved that way the world would be a better place clearly this statement doesn't fit that number two he says human beings should be ends in [6078](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6078.88s)

themselves rather than means to ends well you're setting up this situation where blacks can't be humans yes absolutely so so it's a it's a serious uh serious problem where we find this problem resonating in the americans and so now we're fully in the american setting is with thomas jefferson [6104](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6104.4s)

and thomas jefferson is the most frustrating human being to read because thomas jefferson says the absolute right thing on opposite sides of the same argument constantly right so if you want to read a justification for slavery you you read thomas [6128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6128.719s)

jefferson if you want to read a denunciation of slavery you read thomas jefferson go on before we get into jefferson and the founding fathers and the declaration i want to um close up something on the philosophical antecedents that they're going to draw upon right [6149](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6149.52s)

so we are an hour and 40 minutes or something like that into this conversation and have not actually gotten into the united states of america even existing yet let alone post slavery and how systemic injustice is still happening but you're setting up something really important which is if [6174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6174.56s)

we don't agree on the history and don't understand the history well it's very hard to agree on our current state assessment in which case it's very hard to move forward and i know that from aristotle to the popes to human cons these were all structures that ended up being utilized for what's going to get set up which is a form of slavery in which the um human rights are stripped from people associated with race in a way that previous slavery didn't have and which makes the case so pernicious which also ends up making how it's how it is continued here so pernicious i'm just i'm just thinking as you're like it's almost like if someone was not thinking critically you could see some grand multi-millennial white conspiracy from aristotle that was obviously not christian to popes to um again [6234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6234.08s)

like humans and atheists to aquinas across from spaniards to portuguese to british to colonialists where the americans could fight a war against the british but agree with them on supremacy of race it like it almost seems like that but when we go back and look at it when aristotle was talking about natural slaves he was [6255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6255.84s)

mostly not talking about a racial consideration it was some greeks were natural slaves to other greeks it's just that concept got drawn on and when the papal bull was made for the portuguese navigator it was really a catholic versus muslim fight is how it was framed right and so it's not that as conspiracies [6276](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6276.719s)

often are it's not that there was actually this kind of great coordination it's that all of the useful things got to be sewn together by the later economic motivated reasoning and that's kind of the case that you're building the building blocks for is that correct yes absolutely at the london school of economics when you study politics they warn you all the time that what seems like extraneous uh political considerations can set up and metastasize later into real central problems so if you take i mean we're we're we're off a little bit but if you take things like global mandates from [6324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6324.639s)

organizations like the g20 or the complete shutdown of the world you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist if you study politics political science underscored economics they warn you that when governments find that they can do something then they find a way to do it because that's just another area of [6349](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6349.28s)

power and people have it and given says this in book volume four of the declining fall roman empire that once a power has been experienced it will be experienced again that nobody's going to walk away from that and say i didn't like how that felt you know unless you're the most sort of extreme uh democrat [6371](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6371.36s)

um or a libertarian who you know has read uh frederick hayek i suppose but so so you're absolutely right and let us just remember this complex between the uh the plentitude potus status of the pope which is the pope's global power [6394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6394.159s)

right and uh the distinction between the british uh and uh and the spanish and the portuguese um but when we come to to kant to hume kant jefferson obviously hegel [6411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6411.679s)

uh argued this as well voltaire as well you know all these sorts of people believed in the did they create a great civilization you know do they have a chance elise right do they have write books like candied [6431](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6431.92s)

right you know uh and if they and you know where what country actually is the instantiate of the fulfillment of all these things that the europeans believe are in primitives of civilization it's russia from peter the great to the present it's russia and even though uh leo tolstoy had a great influence on many so tolstoy influenced gandhi to influence schopenhauer the mystical elements of schopenhauer's work are all influenced by tolstoy the first 40 pages of war and peace were written in french because tolstoy [6478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6478.88s)

thought that was more aristocratic right peter the great also tried to mimic the cities that he saw in europe so this idea of great cities and great writing and so on are you know the proper parties cotillions these sorts of things are emblems of civilization that is a very provocative and profoundly infectious uh way of thinking right and jefferson had that in spades himself so if you think about monticello with this constant refurbishing jefferson was always broke always always always uh i i told you before we came on um he has something in common with the the rapper who gets the first album and then goes out buys a bmw or the basketball player who gets the first contract goes out and buys a super expensive car in jefferson's case of course it was books and things like that huge chunks of books and ben franklin who was a more prudent fellow [6550](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6550.96s)

would constantly joke with jefferson about his his spending habits well beyond his needs but every time jefferson traveled he wanted to give the image of being a country squire and one example jefferson writes that the black is inferior right let's remember hume's relationship with dr johnson and his menu enters the young black man but when a french orchestra came to to play in jefferson's home he he bad them to remain for several months so they could teach [6595](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6595.6s)

members of his slave-holding crew to learn to play so that when he puts on his dinner parties he could say i have my own private orchestra you're using the very brains of the people you say have no brains to promote yourself as being a squire and so one understands a pernicious argument where a fellow says blacks are inferior i need to say that because i don't want to give them any hope because i don't want them to run away i need to keep the mistake that's that's one type of thing but is that what he's doing we don't we don't we don't know it's a it would take [6643](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6643.52s)

a massive psychological study so jefferson has read locke and i'm afraid everyone who knows me knows i'm not not a fan of locke at all right um but he he read thomas reed who i thought was the greatest of the scottish enlightenment philosophers [6666](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6666.719s)

and thomas reid's philosophy is a common sense philosophy which most embodies jefferson's positive thinking and uh because of jefferson's pending of the declaration of independence and you know the uh the excursions to the west which he which he authorized and the building of monticello the other [6694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6694.719s)

writings the farming manual with in his notes on virginia and president um there's no doubting that jefferson is part of the he's not just a founding father he is sort of in that top four of what is held to be the founding fathers and students struggle with this when [6720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6720.0s)

they find out you know jefferson had a relationship with sally hemings but she was 14 beginning when she was 14. so he's writing at the same time that she many people might not know that who's hallie hemmings was well sorry sally hemings is a young slave girl who who belongs to jefferson and then he he uh he basically beds her and she becomes his companion now there are historians like joseph ellis and a couple of others who rejected this idea saying that jefferson would never have done that and uh he uh there's one point in which uh i think it's jose velas who said [6772](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6772.48s)

jefferson was just too moral for that and then uh the evidence came out that he did in fact have a long-standing relationship and children with this young girl and we have said how do you talk about this how do you talk about winston churchill [6798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6798.159s)

right who oversaw you know slaughtering in uh i think it's gallipoli and then a famine uh which he calls in the indian subcontinent and said many many i mean absolutely brutally racist [6816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6816.88s)

things did not want to let colonies go call matt again the cafe and all these kinds of things and you're sitting there as a young whether you're black or white but obviously if you're black you know it's kind of you're telling me to treat you you're lecturing about this man as if he's a hero and at the same time [6840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6840.32s)

he's saying these things which diminish me and you and i daniel have spoken about this about the difference between the good man and the great man and jefferson was a great man you cannot take that away from him his his intellectual abilities [6863](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6863.04s)

his curiosity the range of his interests and so on he's a great man winston churchill during the second first of all had the courage to see adolf hitler coming when nobody else did that's one number two uh he convinced his country [6885](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6885.76s)

that they could win and he convinced america to enter the war on the british side two big one political one diplomatic two big feats if you had any doubts about that in the middle of a war he writes a history of the english-speaking people and wins a nobel prize for literature [6908](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6908.32s)

right he wins the nobel prize for peace but oh by the way if you had any doubts about that he enters the paris grand prix for watercolors under a pseudonym and wins for his watercolors right he was constantly broke so he had to write articles [6932](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6932.56s)

all the time boris johnson attempted to pattern himself after churchill in this way um christopher hitchens probably had the better of the two experiences writing articles at the last minute which turned out to be masterpieces and so churchill did that so churchill is a great man [6953](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6953.84s)

who may not have been a good man jimmy carter is a good man who as president never became a great man but his goodness was so good that it made him great such as you see him doing all this work for the poor now i think if we use that instead of dead white males [6975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6975.119s)

we could we could extract from the person real value while recognizing uh their failures because we're not saying these are follies like all human beings are imperfect i've heard people say that too as a defense these are not imperfections these are [6996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=6996.32s)

venalities right these are outside the pail these are venalities and moreover they're contradictory and and if we want to be able to embrace someone like jefferson even a uh i found this problematic with george washington because he's presented as the purer [7018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7018.32s)

version of american humanity compared to thomas jefferson but washington does something that i find almost unforgivable when colin kaepernick was doing the kneeling a friend of mine who was in the u.s military he says to me but gilbert you know my colleagues and i we bled for that flag so that flag really is us and i said no no no it's not no no no no you've got that there are people who identify with that flag much more than you they they are way more patriotic than you and not because you [7059](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7059.599s)

don't want to be you just are not in the circumstance where you can [[exercise]] that level of patriotism and so of course he said to me well who could that be and i said to him the slaves who fought for george washington against the british who would have freed [7082](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7082.08s)

them for someone who had enslaved them and then re-enslaved them after the revolutionary war this is before we go back to jefferson and great man not good man and the ability to hold the complexity so that we don't reduce history into one or the other of [7103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7103.599s)

the two reductionist narratives and before we go into why the declaration of independence is so complicated for anybody of african-american descent right this thing about the american revolutionary war and the slaves fighting and then moving on into [7125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7125.199s)

the civil war and all the way into world war one this was something i hadn't known when i started to look into it and it's it's such a huge part of understanding it can you just elaborate a little bit yes absolutely i mean if you think about if you think about uh it's a key it's a really key point but [7144](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7144.639s)

it runs through it runs through if you if you read people like uh philip curtin on the plantation system right or eugene genovese or you read w.b dubois on on black reconstruction you begin to see [7171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7171.199s)

some of the uh psychological fallout of attempting to make this commitment in the cognitive neuroscience of it we we human beings are constantly attempting to to find more than a marginal likelihood of a particular outcome [7198](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7198.239s)

okay that sounds complicated what do i mean if you live in a society that's organized according to laws rather than kings or men it should be relatively predictable right within a certain band should be relatively predictable if you go into your house there are things in your moving around your house it's generally predictable you actually don't have to have a high cognitive uh [[exercise]] yourself at a high cognitive level in order to move around your house because you you you are familiar with it you know what to expect the experience from 16 [7241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7241.04s)

19 i would say to the present is that blacks could never situate themselves it seems properly in the society and gain more than a marginal likelihood of what will happen to them in any particular situation and there are people who've written about this ellis coast wrote a book [7266](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7266.32s)

called the rage of the privileged class so these are people who i call them brian dumbles so they're they speak well they dress well they're sophisticated they're knowledgeable they went to the best schools they have some of the best jobs they're black [7289](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7289.92s)

and they're writing about the constant shock one of the other things about cognitive neuropsychology is that the brain is always seeking what is called a proportionality constant with the world so you you you're not expecting surprises [7312](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7312.96s)

you drive a certain way according to the rules people aren't supposed to run the red light that's a surprise uh you service your car you don't expect the tires to blow up that's a surprise so there are all these things that people may call it taking it for granted [7332](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7332.08s)

that's a little bit too general we organize ourselves to limit surprise we're constantly trying to limit surprise and the neuroscientist carl fristan speaks about this day off but if you live in a society that's a society of laws and you can never seem to get by the entropy of surprise because the normal things in which you [7360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7360.88s)

you know where you place yourself you don't you know so i'll give you another example i didn't finish that statement but i was surprised when i came to america as teaching at george mason and president clinton president bush president obama was issuing medals [7380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7380.639s)

to soldiers black and hispanic soldiers who served in vietnam in some cases in the second world war who did not receive the benefits that was the sole you you you can't make excuses for that that's a sort of margin beyond a margin of likelihood that is just you can't metabolize that and feel that you're part of the society right i met john mccain once and i asked him i said well you know how do you feel having your medals when in military terms it's a [7432](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7432.719s)

brotherhood of blood patriotism and iron and if you if we're going to believe in that right i couldn't take my medal if i know you deserved one and you weren't given one because if you're going to have a covenant and this is where we're getting to this is where we're going to end up if you have a national covenant and that covenant is that those who sacrifice for the national well-being those who risk their lives well what if the people who are risking [7478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7478.8s)

their lives are actually slaves that the society enslaved that's that was the question of the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa right uh desmond tutu asked the question well if we are all supposed to obey the laws of the state but what if the state is the [7499](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7499.119s)

terrorist you'll put you can't say that the citizen must find a way and this is i think what you were referring to at the beginning where some of these narratives are just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and you know the little engine that could and you know suck it up you know and and deal with life as it is yes you have to do that because in law there's something called mitigation and if you see your house burning it you didn't burn it you have an obligation to attempt to put fire out that's that's that's your job so mitigation is the [7541](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7541.84s)

highest point of personal responsibility because it's actually taking responsibility for something for which you are not responsible so every citizen has to do has to do that as their duty but that doesn't eliminate the responsibility of the state where the state has denied that citizen a benefit to which that citizen is [7566](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7566.48s)

entitled if i pay taxes in the united states i pay taxes in the united states i expect the police officer or the person in the post office or any of these places to treat me just as they would treat anyone the issue isn't that i want special treatment the issue is i'm a taxpayer and the covenant that we made [7591](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7591.119s)

is that i pay my taxes right as a duty as a contribution to the state itself so here you have jefferson sorry washington at valley forge the the soldiers before we get back to jefferson and washington because i know we're going back there i you you said quite a lot of things that reference conversations that we've had where i think i might have since i don't know as much of the history as you do i might have an easier time gruesomely truncating critical parts to [7633](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7633.119s)

be able to just make sure a couple um pearls are hit i want to go ahead and just do that on a few things if you don't mind and then okay so to just make sure these parts go in there i had not known that during the civil war that there were slaves who volunteered to fight on i mean not during the civil [7657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7657.04s)

war during the american revolutionary war slave thought on both sides some ended up going and fighting with the british but some fought on the american side against the british even though the british were already getting rid of slavery before the us were right and even though when the us in setting up the declaration of independence all men are created equal [7676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7676.8s)

and a constitution and could have easily said slavery was a british thing we're done with it now as we're done with britain they didn't they doubled down on it and increment in their constitution imagine being a slave who had been treated so gruesomely already now generationally [7693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7693.28s)

who says you know what as an act of good faith i'm gonna fight side by side with these people risk dying with them because afterwards they'll return the favor and say hey i'm going to free you and let's do this thing together and then they just re-enslave you afterwards and then to have that happen again in the civil war and to have it happen [7713](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7713.44s)

again in the world war one and where there is no act of good faith that has ever paid back well across the whole population that's almost every act of good faith on behalf of the black population is violated right and then after the emancipation proclamation finally happens it doesn't really end slavery [7734](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7734.56s)

just moves the system to this weird kind of um peonage system where now being black just becomes illegal since the 13th and 14th amendment give the possibility for that yes and the part that you told me so and that i again i hadn't known of how intense the reconstruction effort was after emancipation [7755](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7755.36s)

that whether we're talking about black wall street or what happened in 50 different cities right that the most intensive effort for a people to educate themselves police themselves pull themselves up by their bootstraps generate economic welfare in somebody else's culture that they did that and then were externally bombed by larger [7778](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7778.88s)

military forces the people who were black who got into positions of mayor or senator were assassinated right there does come a point where you're like how long it's telling to pull yourself up by your bootstrap story when that happens so much and it never doesn't get betrayed and this is where this is where when we [7798](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7798.8s)

get to the current pissed off local perspective right if someone doesn't know that history they're just like dude why are you so upset yes and the the problem there i'll i'll give you th this sets it out in bold relief so i'll cover all the points that you made jefferson has sally hemings [7819](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7819.199s)

right and this is a as i said a young girl and it's uh lord mansfield in 1772 has elite elizabeth bell she's called deeda she's a black woman young woman lord mansfield is a a judge of the british high court so fully two years three years before the declaration of independence if you want to show the contrast jefferson says i i want sally hemmings [7870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7870.48s)

i have her as my my woman from the time she's a child i'm writing a declaration of independence is there no love in my heart that i can make this explicit that i know better than most americans the humanity of these blacks now he does write that [7893](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7893.199s)

i fear that god is just when i think of what we've done to uh well what's the writing that when you don't your actions your your behavior he's still a very harsh slave master who chases after slaves if they try to escape punishes them rather than saying i know the withholds of your your desire for freedom [7916](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7916.4s)

lord mansfield has a war a young woman she stays with him at his estate he adopts her jefferson says we can't let the slaves go because it'll cause such economic turmoil it'll be very very difficult to assimilate them in society and so on i told you the story of jefferson's of sally heming's brother who is a chef was [7946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7946.079s)

jefferson's chef goes to paris he can he's being invited all over the place he he he sets paris and blaze for his cooking his style his humanity and so on jefferson sees all of this right and he comes back and he says to jefferson when he gets into the white house i would like to be the chef the official you know chef of the white house at the white house and jefferson doesn't answer him he drinks himself to death and some gutters right he can't believe and as you said jefferson could have just paid his passage back to france where he could have a good life [7989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=7989.679s)

fully assured that his sister was okay it doesn't happen lord mansfield is a case it's brought to him called the somerset case in this case the the british slavers and the british had a surreptitious way of being involved so the barclays the lloyds the entire board of the bank of england [8014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8014.239s)

almost every lord in bristol liverpool in london were all engaged in the slave trade they they were secretly owned ships and things of that sort provided insurance provided loans even though it was illegal in britain right but when this case came before mansfield [8037](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8037.76s)

the plaintiff said uh that sorry the defendant said if you rule against us many of us will come to economic ruin mansfield judgment was let justice be done though the heavens may fall now so on the economic side he's different the men of the same era [8068](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8068.239s)

men of the same intellect distinction prestige mansfield was a wealth much wealthier man i mean he was what jeff wanted to be so that's your ambition this is the man you want to be like he rules by conscience and says let justice be done though the heavens fall and then he does something he makes elizabeth bell [8094](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8094.48s)

the first heiress of the western world black heiress by leaving her a share of his estate so every action he took towards her embellished confirmed and embellished her humanity every action that jefferson took towards sally heming merely used her as a means to an end [8120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8120.8s)

although in the end she negotiated with him a settlement for her and her children so the point you are making here is when there's so much debate around monuments made to people who were great men but not good men currently and we think about early history one of the arguments as they were a man of their [8143](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8143.84s)

time and you're basically saying no the best arguments against slavery happened in ancient india and happened in ancient athens and that there have been very good arguments against slavery by moral people for thousands of years right and at the time of american slavery there were other aristocrats and positions of high responsibility arguing against it so it [8164](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8164.0s)

really wasn't man of the time it was a particular kind of motivated reasoning and that it is important to hold that clearly yes and and you gotta be able to hold that without throwing our hands up and saying i want nothing to do with jefferson you can't avoid jefferson that's not the the the real the real lesson in life [8187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8187.04s)

whether it's your personal life or in political life is that you have to hold things together in yourself that are anathema to your values and so on and be able to to maneuver them in the right way and figure out what the lesson is in that thing so jeff is washington is at valley forge [8212](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8212.399s)

soldiers are suffering from smallpox there's a young man who's brought by an american aristocrat says this young man has a solution for smallpox this young man shows them how to create a medical solution for smallpox and they inoculate members of the army at the same time there's a prussian officer who whips the [8239](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8239.519s)

army into shape right it turns out we learn later to be a gay fellow so you have a black and a gay saving washington's army that valley for us it's hard to process to metabolize where the sympathy is in washington given that he had the capacity much greater than lord mansfield to put matters right in america right he he had he had if you're going to say that he had the kind of influence he was a kind of example and people honored him in the way that they did respected him in the [8283](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8283.04s)

way that they did you can't you can't use that as a trophy you have to ask where has he used that as a tool right legitimate slavery act didn't washington enact that say again i said i think washington enacted the fugitive slavery act which happened to be one of the [8304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8304.559s)

particularly great absolutely so my point is at every turn again when you expect the more than the marginal likelihood of an appropriate behavior you get less than the marginal likelihood of appropriate and you get a surprise but when you are living according to [8326](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8326.479s)

principles in general there should be fewer surprises right there should be fewer so now so now obviously more people studying us history whether from a blue state or a red state have come to know about who george [8347](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8347.76s)

washington and who jefferson are than lord mansfield and so there there comes to be a question where it seems like those who are good at the game of power and good at rationalizing um abuses of power that are advantageous to them uh while still being able to appear moral and maybe even be moral in other contexts that are not too costly for them uh end up winning and so this seems to be kind of the beginning of where critical theory starts to say we have to reevaluate in light of the game of power being central [8385](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8385.04s)

but that ends up coming to where we are that is so challenging in culture at the moment so i think there might be a few more steps that you want to set up i'm just kind of making out yeah for sure you know ralph ellison writes a book america novelist great novelist writes a book called invisible man and he's basically saying [8407](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8407.68s)

that as a black man i'm invisible the book has a scene called the golden day right golden day there's there's a black college in the town and the head of the college is dr bledsoe and dr bledsoe mr norton is the man who sponsors the [8429](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8429.52s)

college the wealthy northerner who sponsors the college and dr bledsoe tells one of the students okay you drive him around but you take him to the pretty part of town do not take him to where those true negroes are right because i don't want to get in trouble basically so mr norton sees he's driving around with the young man they take him to the pretty part of town but then he sees someone in the field and this is a old-timer you call them a black old timer and he's in the field and mr norton says take me to him and [8473](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8473.52s)

the young man knows immediately this is against the instructions that i was given you're not supposed to go on the other side of town they go on the other side of town uh the the the old-timer's name is true blood and that just tells you right away [8493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8493.12s)

you know that sounds like a guy from louisiana standing in the marshes who has wisdoms your head can never you know you can't really hold it in your head and uh the man he he mr norton becomes aroused so to speak i mean in every aspect of his being he cannot handle what is being shared with him [8517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8517.92s)

he faints and the young man is just terrified now because i'm in in the south at this school with a white man in my car who's out this is not good so he drives and there's a a a bar called the golden day that's why it's called the golden day scene [8542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8542.479s)

the golden day but on top of the bar because blacks have nowhere to go is the insane asylum so uh they take him to this bar uh and my grandfather and his friends used to pour everything that was one inch high [8564](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8564.16s)

in the bar into one glass and they used to call that swill so they give him something it's the equivalent of swill and he turns red and he's just you know i mean it's probably equivalent to gasoline at that point they take him upstairs to the insane [8584](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8584.399s)

asylum because there is a physician up there brain surgeon but he's completely off his rocker he's insane but they figure that's the closest thing we have to a doctor this is a wealthy man who sponsors the college in this town we need to make sure that he gets some [8602](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8602.08s)

medical attention after all that's who we have to go to and the scene there is one of the most powerful in my view in the history of american literature because the the brain surgeon says why are you sponsoring this boy's [8623](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8623.359s)

education and mr norton gives the usual spiel because i wanted to do well and so the brain surgeon basically asked well can he replace you this is the ultimate question you're doing all of this but can he actually replace you if you believe in this covenant what are the limitations to this [8647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8647.76s)

covenant and the brain surgeon basically tells mr norton i am a brain surgeon i am at the apex of what americans regard as brilliant a scientist a physician and not only that [8668](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8668.56s)

i served in the war and that when i came home someone was dying i get off the ship someone's dying i take my little bag and i operate on him and the white people there beat me to convince me that just because i have this talent [8691](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8691.439s)

doesn't mean i'm equal to them i mean it's a it's a it's a dramatization of precisely everything that we say that when he came off that boat having volunteered for a country that enslaved him and he's also a neurosurgeon which means he's achieved [8721](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8721.92s)

the highest level of scientific training in the medical profession it's possible nobody walks around calling a neurosurgeon dumb i mean that just it just doesn't happen right and so he's at the apex of what should be respectability and yet he finds himself chased away [8745](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8745.52s)

because there is a notion that we can't let you believe that even though you put in the work and you made the sacrifice that you've earned anything so we we have to come back because this is obviously a case where at this point the racism is so gruesome but that was not the case when we started with aristotle where it was a different thing and so i want to come back to you've mentioned that the declaration of independence is fraught because it was written by someone who raped his underage slave and didn't give [8795](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8795.76s)

her or any of the other slaves the opportunities that he easily could have so in one way you just want to throw the whole thing out and on the other hand the people who are seeking a world that has the most kind of just social policy use the declaration of independence as one of the best legal documents that they have it just hasn't been fulfilled as martin [8816](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8816.0s)

luther king said we're just asking to fulfill the promise right um but i think the key thing is the idea that we became so economically wed to the slavery system and built a system that was so dependent upon it until really the [[industrial revolution]] started and and um capitalism more widely started to [8834](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8834.88s)

make it to where we were less dependent on it which is an argument as to what actually ended slavery and created a capitalist indentured servitude system but um that we had to do this weird mental gymnastics that all men are created equal and that we're moral we had to make black people not man right and that that was like that's the heart of the racial thing here that was so e can you like go into that a little because like yes uh daniel you're correct the declaration of independence to me is like cervantes [8877](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8877.439s)

la mancha or dante's divine comedies right or beethoven's mises alemna or you know coltrane some kind of blue i mean i would always cry every time i read it because it was so beautiful right sorry not cold train uh oh status uh it's it's and here's why if if you are a legal scholar and if you are a linguist and you are a logician you you'll read this document and understand so when jefferson i refer to it as the rational saying of the sacred that's that's how i teach it the rational saying of the sacred so we hold these truths to be self-evident already there they are not self-evident but the way we are going to [8946](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8946.84s)

metabolize them is as if they are self-evident this is this is a duty we take upon ourselves to believe in narrative and moral perfection we hold these truths so that allows the people who are non-christian they can't get away from you know the absolute statement that jefferson he didn't say it is self-evident that would have been a mistake right he says we hold these truths to be so that all men are created equal now when you say created equal you moved it from the realm of logic [8995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=8995.2s)

and language and you've added the divine right and endowed by their creator with rights and aliens why inalienable many of my students were confused my american students were confused and jurisprudence they think inalienable means that your rights can't be taken away [9017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9017.52s)

and i will always teach this with ben franklin's statement that he who would limit his liberty for safety or freedom will have neither or something like that well that statement is kind of redundant because you can't live under the american proposition you can't limit your freedom inalienable means that you can't alienate not it can't be taken away from you you can't give your rights away that's the one power over themselves that americans do not have the power to end their rights [9062](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9062.72s)

i i mean just think this is a particularly big deal given that the previous primary way people found themselves in slavery was through uh debt so absolutely they could give away their rights by irresponsible spending habits absolutely you read you read all of charles dickens and so on debtors prisons all over [9086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9086.88s)

london and that sort of thing so so this is a profound statement that does a an amazing logical trick and then subsumes it with divinity and then formulates [9111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9111.84s)

out of this a covenant that is impregnable it's impregnable as stated right and there can be no doubt of jefferson's genius it reads beautifully it's logical it has it has brevity [9133](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9133.92s)

in the sense that the main statement says everything that needs to be said all right and i i've always found it tremendous but you have to ask yourself what and i've taken to i gave some lectures at uh with professor jeffrey stewart and [9153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9153.68s)

adrian davis and nell painter and a group of others at the princeton mid-atlantic scholars association uh between 97 and 99 and i referred to this as a moral schizophrenia that that that that the statement is so profound that it actually it seems to me had to have been created by two separate minds [9180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9180.96s)

one mind creating a saving another mind enslaving human beings and near the bottom in the jefferson actually blames king george saying that it was he who put us in this nasty business of the slave trade and you read it and you're you just you're asking you human beings in relationships psychologists always tell you they talk to you be careful of what you say there's some things that you say that eliminates the possibility of anything rational following that so if someone is going to make a [9231](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9231.12s)

statement like this and has slaves it eliminates the possibility of anything rational which can be said after that right and so this is why the failure of the founding fathers and many many americans at the front end of this period is not just a slight flaw it's not just a tick it's an egregious breach which by now the nation should have addressed in the most formal and formidable ways now you gave me a litany of things so you come to 1863 [9279](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9279.92s)

just just to be clear the nation could have said we don't have an economically viable way to end slavery instantly where the economic disadvantage to us won't equal britain coming back and kicking our ass or someone else who and thus we have to start to phase it out but we're going to have a process of phasing it out over a generation [9304](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9304.479s)

increasing the human rights right right like they so it's it's also not just a theory of trade-offs right like you could say we're in a hard position and we're still going to identify the moral vector right so you didn't have to go with lord mansfield point let justice be done though the heavens fall you could have you had all the power to do something you could have done something yes so now there's always a discussion about lincoln uh it seems to me in my view lincoln was both a good and a great man right and people talk about the letters that they found where he was trying to set up another a slave colony like uh liberia uh and all these sorts of things lincoln would have had the same problem of trying to figure out where to put these people the ancient problem if we don't believe in slaughtering people and getting rid of [9370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9370.0s)

them how do there's a there's a society running how do you you know how do you ingrain them i i read um thomas soule on slavery and you mentioned uh glenn larry and he has a colleague professor john [9391](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9391.04s)

mcwater uh all both great professors and so on and i've watched the exchanges on these issues and as i said to you it feels to me like in america everybody has fallen into a ditch and they're arguing about who has misdecorated the ditch [9416](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9416.0s)

rather than how to get out of it and this is where the the argument on race and slavery has fallen because there's never any real progress narrative progress conceptual progress right when when you live in a country that has a governing mantra that asks its citizens to contemplate uh an ever more perfect union [9446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9446.64s)

so it this should be the american prayer before any public discussion before any disagreement it should be that the end of any debate we have should be setting us on the train to a more perfect union that really you have that there doesn't matter it was written by people who didn't didn't follow it [9474](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9474.88s)

because you know it's like the nba or football people say well we didn't create this league and this league is for all the owners and so on yeah but if you don't show up to work and you do whatever you want you're not going to have a leak you know you're not the one negotiating [9498](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9498.0s)

television contracts you're not the one putting up the money for you know you're not doing any of that is an entire industry behind that and if that industry can manage to pay you a total amount of players 35 of the total revenue generated even if you say you deserve more than that the fact is they generated that [9520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9520.84s)

much i mean you know you you have to see that so the united states of america exists it exists right the question is whether or not even those who feel themselves rightly victims of what has transpired over its history [9544](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9544.399s)

whether they have what it takes to pursue uh a more perfect and here's the point that's not a criticism because we have discussed this already that after the emancipation proclamation you would think people who've been enslaved in one way or the other for [9571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9571.2s)

more than half a century or almost half a century sorry they had their families broken apart their wives daughters and mothers raped right uh um they've seen a spawn of children the families are not actually in many cases unified fifty percent of all of the slave sales broke up nuclear families removed the absol absolutely so so the the pain is devastating excuse me and when i read uh thomas soul and i love thomas soul he's taught me things that i'm going to mention yeah brilliant insights um [9617](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9617.92s)

but i thought his discussion of slavery was historical malpractice because and and i and and i would say i would give him a chance to explain himself but i think glenn larry has kind of put himself professor glenn lowry has put himself in a similar situation just arguing about wokeness [9647](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9647.439s)

without the preliminary argument for how we got there let's go through that the logistics of that if you say lincoln says america is that place where i work for another [9670](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9670.16s)

today so i can work for myself tomorrow excuse me so that i may hire another to work for me the following day now if that is the process i show diligence and initiative [9697](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9697.68s)

work for someone else i show creativity work for myself i expand and i have another work for me and then he can repeat or she that same process that's america all right when the slaves are free those enslaved are free [9722](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9722.8s)

they don't ask for anything they don't complain they don't demand anything what they do is they build 52 enclaves all over the united states they negotiate for schools they more than 150 that i know of become public officials or congressmen or you know these sorts of things you get all these medical schools like mahari xavier they produce morticians dentists physicians [9773](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9773.76s)

all these people because whites don't want to do these things for them they create a vibrant society most people know about tulsa or rosewood or gross point in detroit and a couple of others i have actually found that most people don't i found that maybe now [9796](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9796.96s)

education has changed where most millennials do but um it's amazing how many people that are gen x or older never have no idea black wall street never heard of the bombings and the way i teach it is not just blacks have their own things it's hey they had the right to complain to demand to but they went out and built these things themselves so in terms of the american ethic these are the greatest americans that ever lived in terms of the american ethic these are the greatest americans that have ever lived because [9850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9850.399s)

they pull themselves up by their bootstraps but they pulling yourselves up from having been a slave for multiple generations is different than pulling yourself up from being poor it just is it's just totally different it's a way higher degree of trauma and lack of agency and you're doing it [9872](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9872.64s)

not just from slavery but in an atmosphere of racism right and let's try to understand what racism is everybody has prejudices racism is not a feeling racism is a construct is a is an infrastructure of power and that means that [9895](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9895.68s)

that's why when people say well blacks are racists actually no they're prejudiced they they have prejudices just like you everyone has prejudices but if i can apportion benefits based on race if i can impose on you based on race if i can eliminate your ability to complain and find a solution based on [9920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9920.0s)

race that is racism that is more than prejudice because i still have the prejudice in me but i'm able to do something externally that limits your chances because of my prejudice and so they operated the circumstance it would be interesting to me i mean [9942](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9942.88s)

there are books about it there's one called the burning which is a good book um but i haven't seen the kind of studies or museum exhibitions or conferences that doesn't just merely show that they built these communities [9966](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9966.8s)

but to understand within the terms of the american ethic what it would take for a people to come as you have said out of slavery and have your own insurance companies your own railways one or two people have their own planes banks all these sorts of things with a community laid out and designed as any gated community you can find in [9992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=9992.0s)

today's world and to do that in a wide variety of places it seems to me every american black or white should hold that up as a model of what it means to be american and you know this brings up why you said uh that in your idea of what the american ethic is um frederick douglass was maybe the greatest american who ever lived yeah but again for those who don't know the history and it obviously is beyond the scope of what we can do is we've got a rap in this bit of time right all of those [10031](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10031.359s)

great reconstruction efforts where people took themselves out of slavery still in the presence of ubiquitous racism figured out how to educate themselves to then be able to build whole cities and infrastructure and wealth why we don't still see those is because they were all attacked by asymmetrically larger forces from the outside and [10051](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10051.439s)

destroyed in a way that had no grounding in law with government complicity and so you you had that now think about this you you come out of slavery you have this pack where the the union army is in all throughout the south [10072](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10072.8s)

states have their chances to and you can read about this in black reconstruction for those who want to read it by w.b dubois and and there's also a great great series of studies by a young professor elora durenin court [10096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10096.64s)

should read her as well on migrations to the north and why and people just gave up people but but but why wouldn't they you've been in slavery enslaved all this time you come out you you show the greatest exhibition of the american [10118](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10118.64s)

ethic ever on american soil in 1877 is a presidential election and a compromise is made and grants sully's his reputation by making this compromise with haze and the compromise is that the the army will be pulled out of the south and as soon as that's done slaughter takes place beginning in new orleans of of of state senators and people like that councilman and all those sorts of things and this continues and rosewood they burn it to the ground uh wilmington delaware sorry wilmington um uh north carolina [10172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10172.64s)

where people don't know that there was one of these major major uh residential and commercial areas they're built up by blacks again and and the hurt feelings are still there and it seems like they can't the state or the people there don't know how to be christians because christianity provides the process of repentance there was some very weird i don't know the mental gymnastics involved some very weird christian considerations about darkness yes darkness and blackness was you know that which was against the light and evil and associated with skin color so that christians could justify the most unchristianly behavior even where christians could earlier pre-emancipation enslave blacks rightly un while being christian because it was the only way that the black who was [10241](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10241.359s)

could actually ascend to god like i i mentally i had a student when i came to america i mean i i taught in britain i taught and you know uh and i came i'm from the bahamas but when i came to america there was a student in the back of my class you know there at george mason and he said to me well you know what about the book of philemon in the bible where it doesn't say to emancipate slaves it says to treat your slaves well and the class was in an uproar and my point to them was no no no opera is necessary we're talking and so he i hadn't explained himself and i said okay so your view is that [10286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10286.72s)

should obey their masters here's a problem if i agree with you it means you shouldn't be in this classroom you should be back as a feudal serf somewhere in europe obeying the book of philip and it's just [10313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10313.52s)

one of the things we have to understand i mean you know this from [[game theory]] me from from logic i'm a you know efficient methodologist that bad arguments can never sustain themselves they just can't right you can use power to enforce them right but even that and yes a lot of damage will be done but even that in the philosophical literature certainly for myself if you read people like anaximander and others or if you read dr king truth trust to earth shall [10354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10354.479s)

rise again that and he was speaking of a divine power of this anaximan that was speaking of the karmic power of truth not the divine necessarily a divine power of truth but it's just unsustainable it's just unsustainable and so when people say things like that [10377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10377.2s)

we've got to engage them and rather than be outraged demonstrate why the argument is not good now i wanted to cover something else first i just want to acknowledge we're at three hours and the thing that happened last time you [10395](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10395.359s)

and i had a conversation we had to scrap it was it was five hours we didn't believe anyone would watch it and one of our main goals was to do this quicker right and obviously we've jumped around a bit but we have not got through the founding of the country through the civil war or post-civil war or the debt slavery or you know amendment system or jim crow so i'm going to just acknowledge we i believe both of us are willing to come to a second round of this yes to address questions and do the rest of the narrative if people in the store are interested right i wanna just think of how we move towards some closing thoughts so far realizing we're gonna [10435](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10435.6s)

have to make some leaps and one that i wanna offer is when you're saying let's not get outraged let's be able to have good honest rational conversations because um we want to be connected to the truth that karmically logically divinely in all ways that's a good thing [10456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10456.399s)

i agree and obviously that's what we're trying to do is be able to have a consensus perspective but this also ends up getting to be one of the reasons that people become anti-woke as they say look at these people who are so outraged and i'm going to throw their argument out just because they're outraged and so i want to just kind of steal man again where it's like [10475](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10475.6s)

what the is left if if in the if during the um great rebuild effort that you're talking about they're like okay we won't educate ourself in the traditions that we had come from in mali or wherever we were from in africa we'll educate yourself in your traditions and wear these clothes and educate ourselves more than you to be able to prove the things that we need [10496](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10496.8s)

to and like that um and we'll do good faith contracts we'll create economics what you talk about but then even if we get democratically elected we get assassinated and even if we build the property it all gets burned down and then even if all this work happens for a civil war to say we're not slaves anymore a loophole in the 13th amendment [10516](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10516.64s)

says all we have to do is be arrested for an indefinite period of time and now we can be slaves again and a bunch of  laws like vagrancy and loitering get made for black people then definitely i'd be i would be pissed and i would i would think that if i continued to engage in good faith with a system that [10533](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10533.76s)

had more power that used that good faith to then me over every time that i was a sucker yes and this is where you start to see the hip-hop community adopting the 48 laws of power as a bible and being like come on don't if you don't know who the sucker in the room is it's you right and so one of the things we've talked about is [10552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10552.56s)

you have kind of naive good faith in which case if you have less power and you engage in good faith you get then you're cynical and you're at the 48 laws level but in here there is no good answer for the world it is [[game theory|game theoretic]] in a way that with more tech does in than a war of all against all right and then you have to become post-cynical [10571](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10571.279s)

so there's a kind of post-cynical good faith where you can tell if someone is really good faith or not but you're oriented towards how do we create it right it seems that the thing we have to do is be able to walk through those steps into a kind of post-cynical good faith that can look at all of the really bad faith and the fact that like it's not [10590](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10590.319s)

just historical the stuff we're talking about that whether we're talking about redlining or the remnants of the war on drugs or whatever that these are still current things that systemic injuries associated with race is still happening today right right and so like i think i want people who [[music]] are you know who will get in the uproar about it to do a better job of trying to engage in good faith conversations where the other side really is coming from good faith the question i also want more willingness to participate with the upset right when it arises because it has it has reason behind it and that's kind of what i wanted to construct is a sense of like yes i i uh my there's a gentleman who's a mentor to me uh since i was 11. and i speak throughout the caribbean africa and so on in my role in varieties [10650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10650.0s)

of roles he said to me one day gilbert uh we spent a lot of time criticizing the old now it's time to inspire the young uh because we can't promise them a world filled with a bunch of old liars and crooks you know we can't just we can't promise them that world that's not a world to live in and this was one of the criticisms of tamahasi coates in his book where he writes a letter to his son and the idea is you promised your son a world in which you're only at the cynical level as you say is you how do we get to the post-cynical [10694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10694.479s)

level and i see that uh professor laurie and professor mcwater have mocked him for that but they haven't acknowledged the rightful righteous rage which is come on now what they do is they say yeah but you're killing people in chicago and you're killing people and all these places and i didn't believe in [10717](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10717.76s)

the 1980s when they said the fbi or the cia is spreading drugs in the black community i didn't believe it but it turns out to be true and then empirically empirically true yeah and i think the drug thing has become quite clear it's become quite clear and i didn't [10737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10737.84s)

believe when uh you know um they were talking about targeting and so on and now police officers are i've been collecting them over the last 10 years police or white police officers who say in retirement we planted things on on blacks we we we did a lot of that [10760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10760.88s)

and so if you live in that it doesn't matter so so the lowry i'm getting at your point about how you get to this post-cynical stage power is diffuse in america which is a good thing in one sense but powers diffuse in america it means that any attempt you make [10787](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10787.04s)

to organize yourself especially in a digitally integrated world means that you are vulnerable to attack not just attack but having your reputation destroyed all these kinds of things so that's one there's a line that black americans and any american who wants to [10809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10809.2s)

pursue a more perfect union will have to accept it's from mettanic he was prime minister of austria from 1848 uh sorry from 1808 to 1848 and kept the peace in europe for almost 100 years and ran a small country that controlled a bunch of large countries so he's unique in that perspective and metronic said large countries are always right small countries can only keep from being wrong so but he said another thing small countries should never pursue their ends they should pursue the ends of the larger country with their ends embedded [10850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10850.8s)

so now i want to say something because what you're saying there are certain people who feel that they are part of the metaphorical small country right now that's right you feel just enraged at what you're saying because it sounds totally unethical right and you're actually not making an ethical [10871](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10871.12s)

argument you're making a pragmatic argument that's right you're saying i'm not saying that this is what would be good if you just got to have divine rule but you don't have divine realm saying this is the best way to advance the interests of your people and if you do the other thing you'll actually your own people and you'll be the only one who thinks [10887](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10887.84s)

you're right right so you're making a very pragmatic argument here about how to advise uh the principles of my country not what they would like to hear but how you get from a to b and if those options are all equally bad options my job is to explain which of the worst which of the bad options is the best one [10914](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10914.72s)

to pursue because tomorrow is going to come and if the powerful nation has done what they've done to you no one will care how you feel about it right black america is a canada if it were a country it would be the eighth wealthiest country in the world [10936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10936.8s)

the problem is does it have a unifying thesis in which blacks can work together now the truth is i've seen some of that there's a documentary on youtube i don't i don't remember who did it but there's a lady there who is leading this buy black campaign when one of the young entrepreneurs was [10962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10962.64s)

told well some of your stuff is white he's no buy black is not an absolute not an absolute thing white people make beautiful things we're going to need them as well it's just that if we can we can make laundry soap and you know we can buy [10981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=10981.92s)

from food stores and we can you know there are black designers and people like that as long as a significant proportion of the money circles in our community we have an opportunity to do something so that's one thing that can be done uh you're offering a stranger go on sorry you're offering a synthesis of uh [11006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11006.479s)

martin luther king and malcolm x right now yes uh so that's what malcolm x said martin luther king said the same thing and where do we go from here in fact he he was a proponent of universal [[basic income]] on the same basis there's sufficient wealth in america to solve every problem [11026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11026.24s)

that black americans have economically there's sufficient wealth in america to create a nation within a nation now people say is that a good thing should we should we segregate ourselves you're not segregating yourself when you live in a neighborhood you live in your house you pay for your groceries [11046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11046.319s)

right you and and in trade terms in the in in in the economics of trade there's something called liberalization and there's something called harmonization what you've been sold traditionally is a harmonization proposition where you open yourself up 100 to people who are not open to you at all [11070](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11070.56s)

but there's another way of trading which is called liberalization and that means you pick the areas that you're going to liberalize and you say this is sufficient for us to have an exchange with ourselves that's what benin did with henry the navigator so just to emphasize it [11093](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11093.2s)

if if if you have harmonization that means you and i live next door you can come in my house eat food lay down sleep you can do everything uh use my lawnmower whatever have you if we're liberalized you have limits you can't come into my house you can use my garden tools you can sit under my tree you know uh and so on we can rake up [11115](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11115.279s)

each other's leaves and so on so we bring a mutual benefit to each other so we're enabling but we're not unified so that i'm always the one taking the risk that you're going to give as much as i have given yeah and while this is diplomatic and trade policy if a people wants to regard themselves [11136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11136.64s)

as a people this is the strategy that you have to have metronic strategy that's the strategy you have to have but at the same time you have to say that prayer at the beginning of it that we are seeking a more perfect union and at the bottom of that e pluribus unum out of many one what is the one the [11158](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11158.96s)

one is the things that we agree to liberalize between ourselves that are the unifying factors that brings the country together and if you don't do that everybody is going to lose blacks and whites so this is interesting i think i'm not actually going to try to touch this here because the proposition of the way [11181](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11181.76s)

forward has so much in it you're presenting something like soft black nationalism with a progressive bent like you know kind of a malcolm x black nationalism but soft it'll do trade but it'll do trade that is real politic informed and make sure that the balance sheet balances out and is real politic enough to know who [11200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11200.319s)

it balances with and who doesn't while being progressive enough to try to do better um and you know that that sounds roughly like it's at the synthesis of a bunch of things but there's a million devil in the details that i would love to actually have this conversation and hear more of your thoughts [11218](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11218.16s)

well you and i you and i have spoken about this about hbcus and uh how hbcus actually are the linchpin human beings can only create institutions that's it that's the only things we can create out of thin air institutions institutions turn out to be at every stage in human civilization when something has gained scale a concept has gained scale a strategy has gained scale it has been through some sort of institutional framework even if you have a flash situation where people do a thing you don't have the coordinates to continue that thing and to build on it in any way you can't triangulate it to make it stronger and [11265](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11265.279s)

give it a future because you don't have proper coordination at the root level so um hbcus are institutions that exist already this is what you don't know historically black colleges and universities and universities but the question is whether or not blacks themselves have recharted them so they're actually the on the balance sheet of the black community that's that's that's one of the big questions and there's sufficient wealth in america to do that and there's also i'm speaking now as a [11305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11305.92s)

finance guy right who advises governments on development and there's also sufficient wealth to develop those of the hbcus i mean i when i first arrived in washington dc howard university was in what was called the ghetto you could buy a brownstone in the howard maybe everybody would warn you but you could buy a brown cinnamon at [11330](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11330.72s)

the howard neighborhood probably between 80 to 150 000 now you'd have to pay 3 million but did howard university own those brownstones around itself so that's wealth that had been gentrified that you've missed and the reason you missed it is because one of the things that people who don't live in development zones and [11354](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11354.88s)

trading zones one of the things they don't understand is that essentially cities and countries don't die they may you know they don't really die certainly not in a place like the united states in the manner that we're talking about certainly not in washington dc [11375](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11375.04s)

if there's any place on earth where there'll be humans running around for quite some time it'll be washington dc and you have you have to have a strategy of the future you cannot just you have to have a vision of america [11394](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11394.08s)

this is one of the criticisms of barack obama by diplomatic scholars he didn't wake up every morning with the idea i want britain to do this i want germany to do that i want china to do this and it doesn't matter whether they do it or not i have a picture of the world that i want to enforce [11415](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11415.359s)

and i'm prepared to get as much of that as i can what is the black person the if there's such a thing what is their vision for america one of the problems is that the black vision for america is being defined by whites who oppose them and saying that their vision for america [11441](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11441.279s)

is the behavior of some hip-hop artists or some entertainers or some drug dealers or some guys in chicago that's what america will be bill o'reilly basically said that right that's what america would be but one in 50 america black americans is a millionaire one in 50. so there is and the question dr king asked is are you merely along for the ride this is what you said at the beginning if you merely adopt the virtues of the dominant culture then you are exporting harm based on the same philosophy that once enslaved you so it can't just be [11490](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11490.72s)

that you want to be part of the harvard club that you want to be part of you know you want to get a job at goldman sachs you want to get your b bmw with your summer house in miami because those things export a type of harm and they generate from a kind of perspective on life that was actually the underlying [11517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11517.12s)

perspective in slavery you must assert a new set of values that could become the future values of a country and that's what people who are maligned subjugated and marginalized i wrote a book about this called the epistemologies of displacement they are in a place they are displaced away from the [11542](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11542.319s)

dominant culture but they are actually the source of renewal and they can only be that source of renewal if they believe in the foundational principles and come to embody those principles with a vision of the future that the entire country can benefit from and if you think of [11565](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11565.279s)

people who of oklahoma of rosewood of all these places of wilmington and so on if you could teach that ethic that ethic because the people who didn't experience that can't teach that effort that applies to blacks and whites many of them but if you could teach that ethic [11589](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11589.76s)

that would be something renewing and it just seems to me as you said from the beginning and i think you're right people are talking at each other people are repeating narratives the so-called black conservatives are largely black republicans right and they haven't [11608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11608.96s)

said to themselves i have to increase the marginal likelihood of the outcomes of the values of america that's that's what we have to do right what is the model evidence that if you are good and if you follow the rules that your outcomes [11630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11630.96s)

uh will be predictable not exact but within a margin predictable if that doesn't happen no investor you can't convince any dc to give up their money if you can't make some sort of statement of a marginal likelihood of the outcomes that you propose [11650](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11650.72s)

and so to me that would be the synthesis and obviously what needs to happen is even though we have this discussion and i know you're committed to that we have to get a lot of people around the table and tear this synthesis apart and figure out what can happen to it and we also have to understand [11671](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11671.12s)

that the world is continuing to move you still have the [[social media]] construct that uh our mutual friend tristan harris has uh done this film about the social dilemma uh which is corrupting uh our children corrupting minds making democracy and a proper um shared narrative almost [11693](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11693.92s)

impossible so we have all that to meditate against and uh but i do believe that when you look at civilizations that have thrived even when they face this kind of calamity people have come together and generated a new vision [11716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11716.16s)

and then fought for that vision so i'm going to try to ensure this is the last round of things i say i hear you saying that we have to have a vision kind of voltaires without vision man parishes that we can orient towards i also hear you saying that a minor nation can't have a vision that is outside of the interests of the major [11744](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11744.16s)

nations and so it has to have a vision for the major nations that it is embedded within and so i hear you saying that right now a lot of black america is still having its vision defined by white america if you want to call it that's interests as opposed to defining [11762](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11762.319s)

its own interests but some groups seek to define their own interests define it in a way that is um unintegratable with what you could say from a power point of view as a dominant interest set and so there has to be some way of being able to have unification of visions across power systems well beyond the scope of what we can discuss right now i want to acknowledge quite a few things that i think are worth us discussing that maybe if we do a follow-up we can do is uh you've mentioned in a conversation before that in the way that uh de bois said the color line was defining of the 20th century that it might be in the 21st century and that it seems like the woke anti-woke of which race is probably the deepest center is the biggest dividing line in the u.s and that when you have a polarized democracy which then polarizes the representative class which then creates gridlock in the presence of increasingly effective autocracy i.e the chinese model here then you're in the process of that democracy obsoleting itself so the racial issues seem like they might be central to the viability of democracy writ large period like so the domestic issues and the geopolitical issues then we look at china and its treatment of the wegar and we say [11842](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11842.8s)

is that a better racial model or not and if not then is there actually a requirement for domestic solidarity well understanding how hard the domestic solidarity argument is because when the boss said that and said go ahead and fight world war one they just got again afterwards so what kind of insurance would need to be in place [11862](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11862.479s)

um there's a lot um you've brought up approaches to reparations that you think would be helpful versus terrible there's obviously going quite a lot deeper into the historically black cultures and universities as almost like economic development zones that could be methods of post-cynical upward mobility [11882](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11882.399s)

that are useful but we also have to face all of this in light of the fact that where the previous answers had always been more gdp so more pi for everybody but now we're hitting [[planetary boundary|planetary boundaries]] where we're not going to be able to keep doing that for environmental reasons the whole thing's about to get really [11901](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11901.92s)

cluster and with a lot of new constraints and as you mentioned the polarizing nature of [[social media]] so all i'm acknowledging is we have not even scratched the issues here yet i am hoping that we have built a couple useful parts so that those who just weren't familiar can see when people are talking about systemic [11922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11922.0s)

injustice and systemic racism and people representing perspectives of blm or whatever that if you were unfamiliar you might have a little bit more um empathy and i just want to say two things more that are just random points simply because they're ones that were very motivating to me and they weren't mentioned one is um i just want to highlight for everyone how statistical warfare works in information war where you're trying to control populations by controlling what they think it's easy to cherry-pick statistics so i might have a gaussian distribution of true things and i just picked the ones on this side and i can claim true facts and consilience papers we wrote a [11962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11962.64s)

paper called how to mislead with facts so when you see people quoting facts regarding systemic injustice i'll look for statistical warfare because they'll what somebody can say their uh police are are not [11981](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11981.6s)

more fatal that to black people than they are to white people when you factor these things and the relevant violence in their area which can actually be a true stat but it doesn't mean that it's not true that the police do stop and frisk black people a lot more and they do get harsher sentencing for the same crimes [11998](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=11998.72s)

across the gaussian distribution and so it's like you can have a lot of competing things that are true and you can cherry pick almost every argument from it that's one thing that i'll say and to just watch that almost every speaker slam dunks with a cherry-picked argument and then i find that i i'm almost incapable of actually empathizing with slavery like i really tried to feel it but i've just never experienced anything close to that and you know when you read the depictions of what it was like on those slave boats where everyone is in each [12038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12038.239s)

other's excrement and whatever it's like i don't think anyone who hasn't been there can get a real sense so i try but i find that the more recent cases that seem less egregious but are still so egregious actually boil my blood more because i can imagine them more fully like honestly my empathy is slightly more capable of it and you were mentioning this case [12060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12060.56s)

of you know just coming up to the civil rights time where a man in a suit would be walking to church with his wife being good christians who were in every way respectable and upwardly mobile and the police would come by and fondle his wife in front of him and he could do [12079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12079.279s)

nothing about it because any kind of aggression towards the police would be one of those things that the 13th amendment was a hole for and the the radical and masculinization of that where then you go a little ways forward and you hear about oh well the black community has no fathers see the fault is really the [12097](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12097.68s)

black fathers you're like like yes black fathers that's a really important thing we figure out what to do with that but when you've had systemic emasculation how do you overcome that um and so there's just like the empathy of like the reason history is important is to be able to put yourselves in the shoes of lives that one hasn't lived [12117](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12117.2s)

and to try to get a sense of is the advice i'm offering them advice i could even do in that situation right jefferson your your your points are very profound daniel as always jefferson worried jefferson said i'm worried about yes i'm worried that the white population of america is used to yes which is [12139](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12139.92s)

unnatural in a normal society in a slave society they're used to hearing yes from all quarters for everything that they want what happens when a normal society is set up and they can't hear that yes you know this is a big problem and i think you see examples of that in some of the people who are used to things going their way in fact john paul [12165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12165.76s)

scott writes about this in the anti-semite in the two um and he talks about the anti-semite and his claims cherry-picking facts as well and uh and and is able to make i mean i think the lead up to the first to the second world war is a good example of how adolf hitler's speeches are filled with [12187](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12187.359s)

these kinds of gaussian distributed facts where he just picks things but he never says what germany did to put itself in this situation in the first place i'll i'll i'll end with this there's a wonderful scholar uh at duke university uh whose name just jumped out of my head [12207](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12207.76s)

but i'll remember uh um who has written about reparations extensively everybody it seems to me i that i've read seems to me i'm speaking now just for me as a as a legal scholar as a methodologist [12229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12229.359s)

uh as a logician get reparations wrong mostly what they're talking about is compensation or roman law restitution and so in this uh conclusion that we're making where we're thinking through options i just want to end with this because i want people to understand the options [12260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12260.56s)

that they're buying for reparations cannot be demanded compensation can be demanded because there's a contract and the contract was not fulfilled restitution can be demanded because something was taken and needs to be restored right we get that in the institutes of [12286](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12286.16s)

justinian restitution is a roman law concept been with us for a very long time reparations has no accounting reparations is atonement the person who committed the wrong is the only person who can execute introduce or execute reparations when we look at what happened with germany and the jews [12311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12311.6s)

that was restitution and compensation right that means you have to have an accounting that means you need a system you need a balance sheet you need a set of wrongs you need to connect in common law those wrongs to the reduction of that balance sheet [12331](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12331.6s)

in some way right or you need to show injury to a specific group of people or you need to show loss all right where a game was expected rightly within the law the university of glasgow discovered that they benefited from slavery in scotland [12358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12358.16s)

they decided without telling anybody that they were going to set up a 20 million dollar program for students in the caribbean because their slaves came from the caribbean georgetown university found out that it had about 200 slaves or so they shut down everything held a great conference invited a speaker who's an [12387](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12387.68s)

expert on these things and they're trying to figure out what is the best route all right both they want all three compensation restitution and reparations because a great institution cannot stand idle when this kind of fact comes to the form [12410](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12410.16s)

otherwise it undermines its entire purpose for existing right and i have to give them credit that they've done that so in the solutions i see a lot of people arguing uh the the the scholars name is is dirty professor deity at uh at um at duke university and he's a brilliant guy he and his brilliant fellow he and his wife and uh uh brilliant arguments all around but rest reparations is a moral act no court can impose it no one can demand it so the real issue for us is in whatever we do we mitigate which means do what you can do for yourself now we have a trade policy and a vision right trade with everybody because that's how friendships were made throughout human history with people trading with each other [12491](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12491.279s)

because trading sets up terms where one party isn't giving everything in the other party simply receiving and giving nothing right and then if we can work with the difference between the various compensatory strategies where if there's compensation so for instance people who should have gotten [12517](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12517.359s)

the gi bill and are still alive or their children are still alive that's compensation people who gave labor or gave value and got nothing restitution but where aetna and princeton university and some of the big institutions in the country recognize that they themselves have benefited from uh slave labor or racism or racism that allowed them to pay people inappropriately or not pay them at all and that kind of thing it is they you can't protest for reparations you can't demand reparations if you just continue to mitigate [12567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12567.6s)

and this is dr king's principle and hope that the conscience of that person that the loss of reputation that you create an overton window at the loss of reputation impels them to do the right thing and that's what democracy is about convincing people that there is a unified vision and a covenant that we will all adhere to that happened in norway in 1934 in a war called the red and the black so it can happen and uh so i i thank you daniel this was this was uh we i think we cut an hour thank you for thank you for uh taking the time and [12616](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12616.72s)

uh having this conversation with me and really thank you for all the conversations that we've had up to this point that have been uh that i acknowledge on this topic have been radically asymmetrically beneficial to me and [[music]] so for everyone in the stoa who is [12636](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12636.64s)

watching the stoa uh post their youtube videos without comments but if you can message peter i think there's a discord if there are questions um if there's an interest for a discussion on this i look forward to see what that is and um obviously i have mostly just my own interest to contribute to the space but [12657](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12657.84s)

professor morris has a lot more expertise and also depending upon how this unfolds other colleagues that could be engaged in the conversation and we will in the show notes though link a few resources that are good and few [12676](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHUN18BbNo&t=12676.0s)
