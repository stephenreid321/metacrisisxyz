what i want to talk about today is what emergence is as a phenomena as a property that's actually essential to understand the nature of the universe we live in and it's actually essential to understand what it means to be human and it is essential for understanding the basis for meaning for ethics for existentialism and then also what that portends for the future of civilization and addressing some of the things that [25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=25.08s)

are concerning and that are exciting start by defining what is emergence emergence means something new arises that wasn't here before right we all kind of have that sense intuitively but scientifically how the does that happen how do you bring particles or planets or anything together and all of a sudden the hole has some properties that none of the [49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=49.559s)

parts had like where do they come from emergence is a result of synergy synergy is a result of relationship and relationship is a result of attractive forces there are some kinds of attractive forces whether it's gravity bringing dust together into planets or planets together into solar systems whether it's electromagnetism bringing subatomic [69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=69.659s)

particles together into atoms or the strong force bringing quarks together into protons each of those are [[emergent property|emergent properties]] driven by synergy driven by relationship driven by attraction or whether it's bringing these people together via pheromones or love or intellectual affinity or a topic that we're all interested in like creating a better world which is that it's actually [89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=89.7s)

attraction driving the whole evolutionary story right attraction driving relationship driving synergy driving new [[emergent property|emergent properties]] driving net novelty and new creation and the era of evolution so we can actually understand the arrow of evolution itself in terms of this set of phenomena together it's also the case that if you bring the [109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=109.979s)

same thing together a bunch of the same thing you don't get very interesting synergies you get very interesting synergies when you bring different things with different properties together in the right format where then you have the properties of each of those things and then the properties of the relationship between those which is the new stuff [125](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=125.88s)

things can come together all kinds of ways but the ones that come together most synergistically offer and confer the most advantage in universe selects for it so universe is actually selecting for more differences right so it's selecting for diversity and then more synergistic combinations across those differences that and it's both of those more diversity and more unification [148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=148.319s)

across the diversity right more agency and more symbiosis at the same time is what defines the era of evolution right so like a cell you can think of as having its own agency right its own ability to act and its own boundary and periphery but you bring a bunch of cells together and this collection of cells can reflect on consciousness and existentialism and have a conversation [172](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=172.019s)

like this even though none of those cells on their own do that right and it's different kinds of cells it takes neurons and glial cells and immune cells and stem cells etc to all come together so more agency more differentiation more orderly relationship more synergy all of that comes together in the net defining thing [193](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=193.08s)

is emergence how much fundamental new advantage arises and that's what evolution selects for and with that story on the physical you also have the evolution of consciousness structures themselves right as you move from a reptilian [[nervous system]] to the increased orderly complexity of a mammalian and then a neocortical and then a prefrontal [[nervous system]] you move from the kinds of sentients that map to that of pain pleasure at reptilian to emotional to cognition to abstraction so we have a universe that's moving in the direction of not only more elegance but greater depths and breadth of consciousness itself now this defines an era of evolution that reifies meaning in a very interesting way and one of the things [235](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=235.92s)

that's so interesting is with our capacity for abstraction we cannot just think about our experiential self of the moment but we can think about ourselves in abstract terms we can think about time abstractly deep past and deep future right and that is what allows us to actually understand evolution itself it's an understanding of deep past and fossil record and astrophysics they give [255](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=255.659s)

us a sense of the ability to abstract laws of how that change occurs over time that allows us a deeper insight as to how we got here and then also the ability to vision a future fundamentally more beautiful and more interesting and then be part of that creative process so if we learn how to use it well then we say how can we learn from the past how universe works to be able to imagine a [277](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=277.139s)

future in an omni-considerate way that is has fundamentally less suffering and higher quality of life across all meaningful quality of life metrics for all life right that is omni considerately true good and beautiful and then how can we apply all that learning now to actually help create that world and in doing so we stop just [296](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=296.1s)

being a part of the whole but in our ability to think about the whole and think about the direction of the whole we can actually become an agent for the whole this is huge right the bee is serving this huge role in evolution by pollinating the plants that make the atmosphere that make us but they don't know they're doing that and they can't [313](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=313.8s)

consciously figure out how to do it better but we actually have the capability of looking at what the whole story is and identifying as well the whole evolutionary impulse of universe brought me about and then woke up to itself in me and so we moved from evolution as a mostly unconscious algorithmic process that selects for dominance now to a process that can be [333](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=333.96s)

mediated by conscious agents they can actually forecast a more beautiful future and select to help create that when we don't identify as evolutionaries then we can be actually kind of we identify as nouns rather than verbs and we stay stuck where we're at and then we need pain as an evolutionary driver and then emergence through [358](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=358.56s)

emergency is how we grow as soon as we identify with the inexorability of evolution and ourselves as evolution incarnate we stop needing pain to push us because our whole  purpose for being for becoming being becoming or actually matched they're two sides of the same thing is the lure of the becoming is the bringing about more of the timeless properties of [379](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=379.139s)

the infinite in time right more of the infinite through the finite this actually becomes the basis of our existence and everybody knows that when you are in the experience of creating beauty that didn't exist before in universe that adds to universe it's uniquely years to create you feel a kind of aliveness it's not matched by anything else [397](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=397.8s)

in lieu of not doing that the emptiness causes all kinds of addiction right because that's fundamental to what we're actually here to do now when we all identify as evolutionaries we obsolete the need as pain for a driver when we also identify as fundamentally interconnected parts of a interconnected universe rather than separate things we stop thinking that [422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=422.88s)

there is any definition of success for self that isn't a definition of success for the whole and we stop thinking that the idea of advantaging ourselves at the expense of something else we're inexorably interconnected to make sense at all when einstein said the idea that there are separate things is an optical delusion of consciousness [440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=440.639s)

and in reality there is one reality that we call universe of which we are all inextricably interconnected facets and your experience of self is a facet of that now what's so fascinating is that it is interconnected with all of it it's an expression of the foundation of all of it and it's also completely unique in all of universe it's a unique facet non-fungibly unique [464](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=464.34s)

right and what we're moving towards is a civilization where everyone actually identifies this way as a [[emergent property]] of the whole as an interconnected part of universe with a unique role to play with unique synergies with all the other unique roles to play and then with that synergy with that human participation then [489](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=489.3s)

humanity actually becomes a thing it actually becomes an [[emergent property]] right now it's an idea but we don't have humanity we don't have civilization we have humans bumping right it's we have a bunch of organelles that haven't organized as a cell that starts breathing right you don't have behavior of the hole that is centrally and [509](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=509.58s)

consciously self-organizing if we cherry pick from the huge data sets about where humanity is going right now we can see that things are exponentially changing which means changing it more and more rapid and more and more significant rates and you can cherry pick metrics where things are getting exponentially better and that's true and other things are getting [529](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=529.74s)

exponentially worse and that's also true then that doesn't mean things are getting better or worse it means the current system is destabilizing music and that means [[self-terminating]] and then we either have a discrete phase shift to a lower order entropic system or the emergence of a higher order system that [552](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=552.24s)

is foundationally different than the current system we have now what's so interesting is there used to be such a thing as local problems when gandhi was working with home rule for india it was largely in thought of as an indian problem and it didn't directly affect everybody right when people in the u.s wanted to or who founded the u.s wanted to leave british [575](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=575.64s)

empire there was somewhere else to go and it was a you know a local problem right now when we deal with [[species extinction]] and ocean acidification and peak nitrogen peak phosphorus they're all global issues and you can't solve them without china and without india and without the us without everyone participating so the idea that we have local issues is gone our level of global [594](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=594.54s)

infrastructure and technology is made to where we have all global issues and they're actually existential they are threatening of the biosphere no no one has ever had issues in the history of humanity that threaten the ability of the species to continue nor did they have ones that they had to face imminently in short term nor do they have the capacity to actually face [614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=614.76s)

those kinds of things the data science the technology that could build something fundamentally new what that means is we have the most significant work that humanity has ever had with the most significant capabilities which also means the most potential to impact the biggest picture that any [634](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=634.74s)

humans have ever had music it's easy to think about that and then get caught back into like you gotta do next as part of to win at the current system that is going extinct but winning at a system that is obsoleting the capability of life on earth to continue winning at a dying system is not an interesting win right if you ever think [655](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=655.38s)

about the definition of heaven where you're in heaven and there are people in hell and you're happy you have to be a psychopath you have to be able to separate from the experience of other sentient things enough that you can be totally stoked with that level of suffering well the idea in this world that the level of intensity of suffering that's [677](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=677.519s)

happening can be happening and you can just be stoked because you're killing it in your life you have to be mildly psychopathic if we want to not be psychopaths then there is no definition for success for ourselves it is not definition of success for everything and now when we start really taking that seriously everything changes [696](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=696.18s)

and then you start saying well what can i actually do to make my life of greatest use to all life and then your answer to that question if you take it seriously and really study and really work on it and don't just like ask the question get overwhelmed give up and go back to current stuff you are you're progressively better answer to that question will lead to the [716](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnyWZMvkg4&t=716.459s)

emergence of your life meaning and dharma empath and correspondingly the emergence of civilization making it that's it applause
