Human Nature is a set of universal characteristics that are common among all human beings. It encompasses individual biology, behavior, and psychology as well as aspects of social relationships, morality, and spirituality that characterize our species. The specifics of what comprises human nature come from a complex interplay of evolutionary, psychological, and sociological factors, but at its core it is our shared genetic heritage and the common experience of being human.
