An exponential curve is a mathematical curve defined by a function where the independent variable, or x-axis, increases in a multiplicative fashion compared to a linear curve. This means that a small change in the input, x, will result in a much larger change in the output, y, than the amount of change applied to x. This phenomenon is often exhibited in natural systems, such as population growth and can be represented in many kinds of flow systems. By understanding the nature of exponential curves, we can learn to predict and manipulate the behavior of complex systems more effectively and accurately.
