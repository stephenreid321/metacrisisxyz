Rivalrous dynamics refer to behaviors, interactions, or relationships that are characterized by competition, where there is a perceived benefit for one participant in the situation over another. It is a dynamic that often involves a contest of strength, skill, risk, or resources between two or more parties, the outcome of which can range from both parties emerging from the challenge unscathed, to one party gaining a considerable advantage over another. In short, rivalrous dynamics often involve a conflict with a winner and a loser.
