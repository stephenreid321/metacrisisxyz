Plausible deniability is a concept introduced in the fields of security, games theory and politics. It is the ability of an individual to maintain a degree of responsibility or plausible innocence in the event that their actions or decisions are questioned. This is often seen in cases of political, military or intelligence operations where the individual asks to be unconcerned with or unaware of any potential outcomes, allowing them to deny the connection or responsibility. By adopting the concept of "plausible deniability," one can create a situation in which it is possible to deny, or at least not confirm, actual connections to certain activities or events.
