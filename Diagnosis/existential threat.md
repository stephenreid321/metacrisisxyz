An existential threat is an event or situation that has the potential to cause the extinction of humanity or other global catastrophes, such as a major pandemic, nuclear war, global climate change, or an artificial intelligence taking over the world. It is a rare but significant risk requiring coordinated action to mitigate and could have a catastrophic impact on all life on Earth. Despite the low probability of an existential threat occurring, the immense stakes of such an event necessitate serious consideration and proactive planning.
