Institutional decay is the gradual or sudden deterioration of the functioning of established cultural, political, or economic systems over time. It manifests when an established system fails to evolve, loses efficacy, or begins to operate in a manner that is inside-out of its original purpose. The causes of institutional decay can vary widely, but include a failure to adapt to new paradigms or overly centralized decision-making processes, resulting in a lack of legitimacy or efficacy of these systems. In order to counter this type of decay, it is essential to put in place accountability mechanisms to ensure that economic, political, and social structures remain efficient and effective.
