Critical infrastructure refers to physical or virtual assets that are critical for the functioning of a society or economy, providing essential services to communities and underpinning the successful delivery of a range of products and services. Examples include water, electricity, communications networks and the internet, transport, ports and airports, banking, food production and distribution systems. Critical infrastructure is typically characterized by a high degree of interdependency, dual use or public-private partnerships, and an increasing complexity as a result of globalization and digitization, as well as vulnerability to risks and threats. Consequently, with advances in technology and risk management, critical infrastructure should be managed with resilience and vigilance.
