A social system is a historical, semi-autonomous, dynamic, and interconnected system of social organisation that is composed of individual and collective actors and their associated beliefs, norms, and practices, which influence and are influenced by the external environment. It is an emergent system resulting from the complex interrelationships between individuals, organisations, and the environment, which together define the unique patterns, processes and structures that shape social reality. Social systems can be conceptualised as exhibiting particular structures, which are both product and producer of behaviour and constitute the roots of social stability and change.
