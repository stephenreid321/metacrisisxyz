Species extinction is the complete and irreversible loss of an organism species from the planet. It is a complex phenomenon that results from numerous factors driven by anthropogenic activities, such as overexploitation of natural resources, climate change and habitat destruction. Extinction can be caused by genetic changes in a species that induce sterility, or by population sizes which become so low that genetic diversity is lost, leading to extinction. Ultimately, species may go extinct locally, regionally or globally due to a combination of human-induced impacts with natural changes and catastrophes. This can be devastating for the planet's biological diversity, as species provide valuable ecosystem functions and health services which cannot be replaced.
