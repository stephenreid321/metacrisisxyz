A dystopia is a fictional society characterized by the oppressive and degraded social, political, and environmental conditions which limit citizens’ freedom and personal rights. It allows for only limited autonomy and the absence of basic human needs such as safety and well-being, often in contrast to an idealistic vision of utopia. Dystopian societies may be seen as a warning to our present condition and a potential foresight of how we may act and be affected in the future if we continue down an undesirable path.
