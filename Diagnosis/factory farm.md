Factory Farms are industrial-scale agricultural production facilities that are characterized by intensive rearing of animals, as well as the use of specialized equipment and techniques such as confinement, mechanization, and the use of chemicals and drugs, in order to maximize agricultural efficiency and output. Factory Farms are often large, producing animals, in large numbers, that are bred, fed, and slaughtered in a very short amount of time, often creating adverse effects on the environment, animal welfare and worker safety.
