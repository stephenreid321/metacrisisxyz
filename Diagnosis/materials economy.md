The materials economy is a systems-level term that describes the management of resources and materials on a global scale. It entails innovations in production processes and waste management that ensure sustainability, as well as economic decisions that drive economic growth and competitive advantage. It relies on understanding the unique characteristics of each material to guide its production and use, taking into account the transportation, recovery, recycling and reuse of materials throughout their life-cycles. This requires a holistic approach to understanding the costs and benefits of production, use, and disposal of each material, and strategically balancing investments in material production and processing against the costs of resource scarcity and environmental damage.
