The term “world system” describes a complex network of complex interconnected systems that span multiple nations and interact to influence, impact and shape each other. It includes but is not limited to, the global economy, political relations, and international power dynamics, which often manifest as very different sources of power, privilege, and disadvantage. The world system is constantly in flux due to circumstances and changes that occur both domestically and internationally, forming a dynamic landscape of cooperation and competition. Ultimately, the world system is comprised of individuals, nations, and global institutions with power and authority to shape the terms of global and local activities.
