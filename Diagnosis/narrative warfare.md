Narrative warfare is a form of socio-political warfare aimed at influencing the beliefs, values, and decision-making of targeted populations. This is done by creating and amplifying stories of a desired narrative to shape the information environment and ultimately shape the public discourse. Through the continual reinforcement of a specific narrative, or the weakening of an opposing narrative, narrative warfare can produce an impact far greater than what can be achieved through traditional tools of combat.
