Self-terminating refers to the process by which a civilization or society collapses or destroys itself, often due to internal factors such as resource depletion, social and political instability, or ecological degradation. In the context of failed civilizations, self-terminating refers to the inability of a society to adapt and find sustainable solutions to the challenges it faces, ultimately leading to its demise. This process can occur over a short period of time, such as in the case of a sudden collapse, or it can be a gradual decline over many generations. The concept of self-termination highlights the need for societies to continuously examine and address potential vulnerabilities and to take proactive measures to prevent collapse.
