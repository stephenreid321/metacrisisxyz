Fiduciary responsibility is the entity’s obligation to act in the best interest of its stakeholders by upholding the trust that is placed in it to manage that entity’s assets and resources for the benefit of its stakeholders and no other. This requires sound judgement and decisions that put the interests of the stakeholders ahead of those of the entity or its owners. Fiduciary responsibility is a foundational element of responsible governance that ensures the trustworthiness of the entity’s custodians and guardians.
