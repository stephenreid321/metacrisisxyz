A nation-state is a form of political organization characterized by a defined geographical boundary encompassing a distinct population of citizens that share a common culture, language, and legal identity. It is distinct from other forms of government, since it is rooted in a strong sense of collective identity and a common ancestry. The nation-state typically establishes a monopoly on the use of force and is reinforced by exclusive political and economic organizations. Its centralized power allows it to create policies and culture that is influenced by the collective will and interests of its citizens, which serves to reinforce its status as an independent body.
