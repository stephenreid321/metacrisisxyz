Private property refers to ownership of resources, land, or capital by a private entity or a sole individual which is legally recognised and protected by law. The ownership rights are typically defended via personal freedom and the security of a defined property specific to the rights-holder. Private property is distinguished from collective ownership, which is held in common by a group of individuals or institutions. It is distinct from public property, which is owned by the state or a government and is freely accessible to all citizens. Private property is a foundational component of most contemporary economies and has numerous political and social implications.
