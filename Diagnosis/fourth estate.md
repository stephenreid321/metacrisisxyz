The term “Fourth Estate” refers to the public press and its influence on society, politics and culture. Historically, the Fourth Estate has been known to act as a counterbalance to the three main branches of governance: judicial, legislative and executive. The Fourth Estate can act as a researcher, investigator and watchman, delving into issues of government, politics, economics and more, informing and educating the public. This can be a powerful and positive force, but there are also legitimate concerns over the unchecked power of the Fourth Estate and its ability to miseducate, misinform and manipulate people and democracy as a whole.
