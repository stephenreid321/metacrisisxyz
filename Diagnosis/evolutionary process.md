An evolutionary process is a holistic conception of adaptation, growth, and learning composed by dynamically interdependent elements. It is a system of growth, dynamic equilibrium, and adaptation within a context where elements interact, influence, and shape each other and the environment to bring about change. It refers both to the short-term adaptation and learning, as well as the long-term growth, development and evolution. Evolutionary processes are often underpinned by principles of complexity, emergence, integration, and co-evolution.
