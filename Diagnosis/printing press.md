The printing press is one of the most important inventions in history and has revolutionized the dissemination of information. It refers to a mechanical press used to reproduce printed materials such as books, newspapers, and magazines. Using ink, the printing press transfers an image, or ‘forme’, made up of raised or recessed characters and symbols, onto a substrate such as paper, cloth, or plastic. The press operates with movable type, in which the characters and symbols are greater than the surface of the substrate, and the paper is added along with the ink and pressure to the forme surface in order to create a printed page. This mechanical process significantly increased the speed and accuracy of printed production, enabling mass production and the spread of knowledge.
