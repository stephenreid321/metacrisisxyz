Problem Space is a term coined by Herbert Simon to represent the set of all possible problems that can arise in a given domain. It is a concept often used in Artificial Intelligence research and refers to the entire range of possible problems, solutions, rules, and constraints that could be relevant to a given field. To better understand a problem space, one must analyze the domain of the problem and then decompose it into its component elements. This process allows the individual to gain insight into its structure and develop deeper understanding of the problem and its context. Ultimately, problem space allows one to find appropriate solutions more quickly and accurately.
