Game Theory is an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand human behavior by exploring the methods for making decisions in competitive and uncertain environments. It is a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic behavior among parties-agents- that are in conflict or cooperation with one another. It applies to a variety of individual and group decision-making situations- including gaming, economics, business, politics, biology, law, and ethics- and examines age-old problems such as cooperation, trust, fairness, and justice. By combining concepts of rational choice, probability, uncertainty, and strategic interaction, Game Theory offers the tools necessary to evaluate how the various choices available to an agent affect the outcome of the system in entirety.
