An economic system is the set of institutions, mechanisms, and processes that structure the production, distribution, and consumption of resources, goods, and services in a society. Economic systems are affected by markets, interactions between producers and consumers, which form incentives and tradeoffs. Different economic systems vary in the allocation method of resources and the extent of government involvement in economic management and decision making. The most fundamental aspect of an economic system is its degree of flexibility, which affects its ability to adapt to changing conditions and to recognize and reward value creating activity.
