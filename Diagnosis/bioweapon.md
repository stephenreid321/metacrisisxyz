A bioweapon is a weapon of mass destruction created through the deliberate use of infectious biological agents, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi, as an agent of warfare or terrorism. By weaponizing a naturally occurring organism, bioweapons are able to broaden the range of offensive possibilities available to the attacker and the damages inflicted can potentially be much wider than those caused by traditional weapons such as guns and bombs. In recent years, bioweapons have become a topic of increased international concern due to the potential impact of a large-scale attack, as it would have devastating consequences on public health, environmental resources, and the economy.
