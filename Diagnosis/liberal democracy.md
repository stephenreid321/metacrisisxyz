Liberal democracy is a political system that is based on principles of freedom and equality, both in terms of civil liberties and political decision-making. It is characterized by the rule of law and democratic participation, ensuring that citizens have the right to full and fair representation process, the protection of their rights and access to the resources necessary to exercise those rights. As a stable and dynamic form of government, liberal democracy seeks to uphold social justice, promote public accountability and safeguard individual freedoms, while also enabling countries to address global concerns and foster economic prosperity.
