The Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid advances in industrial production and labour-saving technology in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, signaled an unprecedented shift in economic and production structures, transforming entire nations and resulting in the mass production of goods, improved standards of living, and the emergence of modern capitalism and industrial regimes. In essence, it was a classic example of ‘creative destruction’: enormous gains in productivity and efficiency enabled by the great technological innovations of the period, such as the steam engine, the mechanical loom, and interchangeable parts, coming at the expense of traditional economic and social structures. Its legacy can still be seen in the unprecedented economic development of the twentieth century.
