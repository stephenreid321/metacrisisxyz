A reward circuit, also known as the hedonic circuit, is a set of neural pathways in the brain responsible for the evaluation and reinforcement of pleasurable stimuli. It consists of neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, that combine to create a sensation of pleasure when a specific behavior is performed or a particular reward is realized. This reward circuit is driven by activity in the brainâ€™s reward system and plays a major role in conditioning and learning, as it helps an individual remember and repeat behaviors that lead to a positive outcome.
