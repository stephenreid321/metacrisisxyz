National security refers to the integrity of a state, its interests, its citizens, and its resources, which is maintained in accordance with legal standards and principles through the application of economic, military, political, and diplomatic capabilities. It provides freedom from fear and freedom from want, as well as the preservation of national values and goals, without simultaneously exacerbating conflict or infringing upon the rights of others. Ultimately, national security is a means of protecting the state and its citizens from physical and virtual threats, both domestic and foreign.
