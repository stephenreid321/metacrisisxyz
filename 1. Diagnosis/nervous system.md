The nervous system can be defined as a complex network of specialized cells, tissues, and organs that helps coordinate activities of the body by transmitting signals from one part of the body to another. It is the body's main communication network, made up of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of sensory neurons, clusters of neurons called ganglia, and nerves that connect the central nervous system to every other part of the body. The nervous system is responsible for our responses to both internal and external stimuli, allowing us to respond quickly to changes in our environment and to maintain internal homeostasis.
