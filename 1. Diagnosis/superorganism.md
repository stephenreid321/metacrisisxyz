A superorganism can be described as a complex social or ecological system composed of members that are components of a unified, self-regulating whole. This cooperative organization can extend across various levels of complexity, from multi-cellular organisms and colonies of animals to large-scale human societies, and even planetary ecosystems. The components of a superorganism often interact through division of labor, consensus decision-making structures, and processes of self-organizing adaptation. This arrangement allows the system as a whole to more effectively deal with changing environmental or social conditions and to coordinate action for the collective benefit of all its members.
