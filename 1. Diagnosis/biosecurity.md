Biosecurity refers to the measures taken to prevent unintentional or intentional acts of harm to the environment, animals, and humans due to biological agents. It is the practice of protecting humans, animals, and the environment from the risks posed by biological agents, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins. This includes designing, implementing, and monitoring practices, protocols, and policies to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of these agents, as well as to mitigate and manage any outbreaks, incidents, or crises that may occur.
