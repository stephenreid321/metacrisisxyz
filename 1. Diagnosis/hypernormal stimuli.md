Hypernormal stimuli is an evolutionary concept that proposes that certain patterns of stimuli can become more salient to an organism than natural stimuli historically associated with meeting important needs. These stimuli are 'hypernormal', meaning they are more stimulating than normal stimuli needed to meet the same need, and can therefore cause the organism to overinvest resources in the most stimulating stimulus relative to the actual need it serves. Because the dynamic of hypernormal stimuli occurs without conscious awareness, it can lead to dysfunctional patterns in the organism’s behavior.
