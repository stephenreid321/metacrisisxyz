It is a multifaceted network that enables the flow of funds between savers, investors, borrowers, and financial entities, helping to facilitate anytime and anywhere access to capital and financial services, enabling innovative sectors to emerge and grow. Additionally, the financial system is constantly evolving and adapting to regulatory change, technological advances, and global trends.
