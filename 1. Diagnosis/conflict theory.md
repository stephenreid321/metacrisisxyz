Conflict Theory is a sociological analytical framework which examines how human behavior is shaped by power dynamics within and between both societies and individuals. It assumes that conflict and competition are an inherent part of social life and recognizes that power hierarchical structures, such as class and gender, both shape and are shaped by social relationships and interactions. When applied, Conflict Theory provides a critical analysis of the distribution of power and resources, allowing us to identify sources of inequality and oppression. Ultimately, the goal of Conflict Theory is to reduce oppression within the larger social context in order to promote a more equitable and just society.
