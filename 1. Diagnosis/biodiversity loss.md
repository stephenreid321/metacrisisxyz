Biodiversity loss is the process of reducing biodiversity due to human activities. It is typically caused by over-exploitation, resource extraction, habitat loss, invasive species, climate change, and pollution. In its broadest sense, biodiversity loss is the steady decline of the variety and abundance of species in an ecosystem, ranging from the local to global level. This has both ecological and economic consequences due to the loss of ecosystem services, meaning the functions and processes that are provided by healthy and diverse ecosystems. The current rate of biodiversity loss is unprecedented and threatens to destabilize the web of life, making it essential that measures are implemented to protect existing species and restore the damaged ecosystems.
