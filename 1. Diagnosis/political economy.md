Political economy is an interdisciplinary study that seeks to understand the relationship between economic phenomena and political, social, and legal systems. It examines the way economic structures and institutions shape the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, as well as the way that economic practices shape political, social, and legal systems. This perspective is interdisciplinary, drawing from economics, sociology, history, and political science in order to develop a comprehensive view of economic activity. It ultimately helps to identify and explain the dynamics of power, labor, and production, as well as how these dynamics affect the lives of those within the economic, legal, and political systems.
