Asymmetric power is a concept central to understanding the agency of social systems and can be defined as a power dynamic which is out of balance. This imbalance or asymmetry arises when one party has significantly greater access to resources, influence, or other factors that enable the exercise of power, while the less powerful party has little or no access to these resources. The consequence of an asymmetric power structure is an unequal distribution of wealth, privilege and autonomyâ€”which, in turn, leads to further asymmetries in the power dynamic and that reproduces systemic oppression. This can manifest as unequal access to opportunities and benefits, disparities in healthcare and education, as well as the use of coercive force to keep the less powerful party in a subordinate position.
