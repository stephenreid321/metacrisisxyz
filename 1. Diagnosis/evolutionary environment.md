Evolutionary Environment is a concept referring to the context in which adaptations and behaviors emerge in response to varying environments over time. It incorporates both the ‘outside’ environment of environmental factors and external drivers (such as food availability or changing climates) and the ‘inside’ environment of internal forces, such as hormones, that can also affect evolutionary adaptation. From an evolutionary standpoint, the more rapidly a species can adapt to different environmental contexts, the more likely it is to survive in the long-term.
