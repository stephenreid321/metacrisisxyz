Dead zones refer to regions of the ocean depleted of the dissolved oxygen necessary to support marine and aquatic life. These zones are caused by excessive nutrient pollution, which can lead to eutrophication, a process in which algae become so numerous that they deplete the oxygen from the surrounding water. This process can create an imbalance of the local marine environment, having devastating impacts on living organisms and eliminating entire species from the ecosystem. In addition, dead zones often result in further environmental consequences, including reduced water clarity and decreased biodiversity.
