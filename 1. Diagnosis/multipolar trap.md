The multipolar trap is a dynamic state of international affairs in which the power of each state is balanced by the power of their neighboring states. In this context, no single state is capable of unilaterally achieving a lasting hegemony, leading to a “security dilemma” in which states compete for resources and power. The security dilemma inhibits cooperation and prevents states from achieving mutual gains from cooperative activities, leading to perpetual rivalries and instability in the international system.
