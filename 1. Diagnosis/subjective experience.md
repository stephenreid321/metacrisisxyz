Subjective experience is the experience of conscious thought and feeling that is determined by our individual perspective. It is a product of conscious awareness, and involves interpretation and decision-making based on our particular life experiences. Subjective experience allows us to recognize our individual sensory and emotional states, and to interact with the world from an individual viewpoint. It is an essential part of being human, and is central to our sense of self, relationships, and inner growth.
