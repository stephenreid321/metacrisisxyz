Epistemic commons is the shared access to knowledge and information for the purpose of collective learning and problem-solving. It is composed of both explicit and implicit forms of knowledge that come from collective knowledge networks, which can be open and accessible to anyone. The epistemic commons provides a platform for collaboration, meaning it enables collective approaches to problem-solving by leveraging new combinations of ideas and perspectives. By cultivating a communal atmosphere of collaboration, the epistemic commons contributes to creative, collective problem-solving, paving the way for wider innovation.
