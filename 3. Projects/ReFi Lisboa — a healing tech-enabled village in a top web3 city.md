# ReFi Lisboa — a healing tech-enabled village in a top web3 city

![GRANT WITH IMAGES](https://refi-dao.notion.site/ReFi-Lisboa-a-healing-tech-enabled-village-in-a-top-web3-city-335b39a41dbe47849acefccec810bdfb)

ReFi Lisboa is gathering the brightest hearts and minds into the work of regeneration at the center of a top European web3 city: Lisbon. We are gathering 150+ leaders and a number of physical spaces to create a decentralized village in Lisbon under a single unified mission: 

To regenerate the earth using the most powerful tools of our time.

Rooted in a core belief that we need to heal the world within in order to heal the world around, we are bringing together regenerative technology, art, music, design, and economics to create a new culture at the heart of this beautiful city. 

Balancing the power of tech with conscious awareness, we are building a physical network of regenerative leaders and spaces across a range of sectors and problem areas. We’re gathering public, private, and third-sector institutions as well as environmental, ecological, social, and cultural thought leaders.

We see ourselves as an embedded accelerant to the regenerative economy—enabling existing institutions to harness the power of regeneration and realize a prosperous future for all…

## Technology is key

We believe that technology is not just hardware and software, but also all of the incredible low-tech solutions that have existed for millennia: meditation, yoga, breath work, plants, and various forms of medicine.

We are preparing to raise funds not only to acquire land and pioneer regenerative economics using cutting-edge technology such as: public ledgers, remote sensors, satellite imagery, and AI…. but we are also meeting every single month leading up to our pinnacle two-part event on November 15-19 culminating in a mass tree planting party at the pioneering regenerative village in Alentejo.

Join us. 🙏🏼

## Annual Meeting 🎊

We are preparing to host the first ReFi DAO Annual Meeting on November 15-18, where the leaders of the regenerative future will gather for 4 days during Web Summit to dive deep into the inner and outer work of regeneration. We’ll have two days in the city, followed by two days in nature with friends and family planting trees and working with animals at [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com/) in Alentejo, Portugal.

1. Identify 2-3 land-based regenerative projects and assess feasibility for development across carbon, biodiversity, water, and renewable energy:
    - Project identification and carbon assessment: 20% ($12,000)
2. Launch the first ‘Regenerative Guide’ to Lisbon (first a mobile app and later a beautiful print edition) of all the key regenerative people, projects, businesses, shops and activities:
    - Content gathering, data structure and interaction design: 15% ($9,000)

In order to fulfill these objectives, we need to provide a salary for a small core team of 3-4 part-time members across a variety of functions:

- Partnerships
- Fundraising
- Operations
- Marketing
- Events

Your donations will help make this all possible!

## 2023 OKRs 🗓

For the next 9 months, we want to achieve the following:

1. Begin fundraising for land-based regenerative project development as a common resource for the community—held in perpetuity forever. 🏜
2. Release a hard-copy of ‘Lisboa Regenerativa’ and distribute it to 10,000 Lisboetas and tourists via local shops, cafes, restaurants, and tour providers 📔
3. Prototype a ReFi dApp to onboard talent and capital into the local regenerative economy 📱
4. Announce a formal partnership with NOVA University, the University of Lisbon, and the City of Lisbon Municipality—hosting our first event together 🏫
5. Host three volunteer days serving homeless, orphans, and refugees as a community.  🥗👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
6. Spread the love, light, and joy of regeneration. ♥️☀️🤗

## Minimum Viable Village (”MVV”)

We’ve been working to secure initial agreements with a number of regenerative space providers as a part of our minimum viable village development in the heart of the city. Below is a map outlining possible locations for strategic spaces that can be accessed on a role-basis by members of the ReFi Lisboa community.

## Phygital Key + Gitcoin Passport = ReFi Passport

We want to prototype a phygital key that will provide gated-access to the shared resources in the physical and online community of ReFi Lisboa. Our concept is to produce a physical token hardware kit that can be customized for other local nodes with a number of core features and functionality.

Ideally, this key would be integrated with Gitcoin Passport where each key is a DID that can unlock a ReFi Passport—the gateway to the regenerative economy in Lisbon and beyond. While just a concept, the opportunity to bridge physical and digital worlds to onboard talent and spaces into the regenerative economy has huge potential.

## ReFi dApp prototype

We want to prototype a mobile dApp that acts as the gateway to the regenerative economy by providing a number of base-layer software components that allow any entrepreneur to plug their app into the ReFi DAO network of healing villages in cities around the globe.

- SDK (software development kit)
- Knowledge Graph + REST API
- RBAC (role-based access controls)
- App templates ([Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) for ReFi, [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/) for ReFi, etc.)

We’ll do this first using low-code tools to gain insights into user needs, and look to fund the development of this open source software project as we validate the prototype’s feasibility, desirability and usability.


## Q2 Activities

We are looking to fulfill a number of activities, subject to the success of our Gitcoin campaign. Every dollar counts! Here’s what we’d love to undertake with your support

- Phygital token prototyping (NFC access to spaces)
- ReFi super dApp prototyping (WeChat for the regenerative economy)
- Monthly events
    - Parties with free food at homeless shelters, orphanages, and refugee support centres
    - Collaborative impact ecosystem mapping in Lisbon (nature, innovation, carbon, social, education, etc.)
    - Public, private, and third-sector institutional engagement
- Content creation (videos, blogs, newsletters, podcasts, etc.)
- Regenerative space partnerships (venture studio, co-working, maker labs, performing heARTS, healing heARTS)

## ReFi Lisboa + TDF Concept 🐑

As a part of Q2’s Objective 1, we have made progress in outlining an initial land-based opportunity for regeneration.

We’re working on the initial regenerative project development concept in partnership with the pioneering regenerative village “[Traditional Dream Factory](https://twitter.com/tdfinyourdreams)” or “TDF” which is the first pilot of the [OASA network](https://twitter.com/oasaliving). Below outlines some of the potential opportunities and considerations for financing the acquisition of 25 hectares of land adjacent to TDF to be held in OASA’s Earth Trust (held in perpetuity, stewarded by regenerative principles).

Psst… did we mention how much we love sheep?

## Finances

As of today, all funds are managed by a fresh multi-sig on Ethereum:
