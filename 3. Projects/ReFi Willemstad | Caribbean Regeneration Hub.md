Hi Gitcoin community!

We're excited to accelerate Caribbean entrepreneurs and earth stewards with the tools of ReFi and Web 3.0.

About Willemstad
Willemstad is the capital city of the Caribbean island nation of CuraÃ§ao. It is located on the island's southern coast and is a popular tourist destination known for its colorful architecture, rich history, and vibrant culture.

Sustainable and Regenerative management of the city has been one of the key focus areas in recent years - with initiatives such as the Curacao Rif Mangrove Park (https://www.mangrovepark.org/) and Mentea Kaweta, a program to revitalize the city based on Regenerative Principles (https://www.mentekaweta.com/about/).

ReFi Willemstad will operate out of Kolab (https://www.kolab.cw/), an innovation center and co-working incubated by Kolektivo Curacao. 

With the support from this Grant Application, we aim to operate a launchpad for social entrepreneurs - best-of-class groups would be invited to join an incubator - where different finance and revenue share forms will be researched and evaluated together with regional partners.

Willemstad is the home base of the Kolektivo project, a ReFi project that creates tools for local regenerative economies. For over four years, we've been building a Web 3.0 ecosystem in Curacao through various developments such as CuraDAO, an Impact DAO launched in 2019, CuraDAI, a DeFi Stablecoin found for the island, and more recently through the launch of Kolektivo Festival (with over 750+ attendees - check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8gsfAaMxU) and the deployment of the first Kolektivo Community Currency! 

You can learn more about the ReFi initiatives we supported in 2022 in the Kolektivo Curacao impact report: https://www.kolektivo.cw/impact-report

With your support, we can continue to progress ReFi and regional development. We hope to welcome you soon to Willemstad to taste our Regenerative revolution yourself!

Danki
