# Myseelia: A Decentralized Data Network for Collective Intelligence

### Introduction

We propose a decentralized knowledge graph for cultivating collective intelligence  in order to address the metacrisis. By weaving perspectives into a semantic knowledge network, we can co-create a coherent systems map for navigating away from collapse and towards a flourishing future for all.

### Project Overview

We are aiming to map the pathways towards planetary regeneration by integrating relevant perspectives and data silos into a decentralized knowledge base. By meaningfully weaving these subjective perspectives into a shared knowledge base, we can co-create a comprehensive systems map for coherently addresses the metacrisis.

As the metacrisis is characterized by its interconnected and entangled nature, a decentralized knowledge graph can effectively map the relationships and interdependencies across complex challenges, such as climate change, exponential technology, AI, land degradation, and more. This comprehensive mapping enables stakeholders to understand the intricate relationships and dependencies among these issues, empowering communities to make informed decisions and collaborate on effective solutions.

The use of semantic web standards allows for the knowledge base to be understandable by both humans and machines, allowing it to answer questions, such as:

- Who is already creating a positive impact? How?
- What resources are available?  Locally?  Globally?
- Where are there regenerative investment opportunities?
- How can I make a living doing what I love, in alignment with social and planetary health?

Funds raised from this grant will mainly be used for open source software development, but could also be used for research and technical infrastructure.  We are open to contributors and collaborators!

### Proposed Next Steps:

- Continue to develop and connect existing relevant knowledge bases
	- [Steven Reid](https://stephenreid.net/) has already initiated a metacrisis knowledge base: [https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/Welcome](https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/Welcome). We propose extending it with semantic annotations using [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_Semantic_MediaWiki), which enables wikis to structure their knowledge for better computer-processability. This approach allows for automatically-generated lists, visualization, complex querying, data integration, and external reuse, making it compatible with semantic web standards like RDF and SPARQL. Structuring the data in this manner provides several [benefits](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Using_SPARQL_and_RDF_stores), such as:
		- Improved query performance
		- Additional interfaces
		- Reasoning features and ontology-based data access
		- Data integration and ontology reuse
		- Physical distribution of computing resources
	- Darren Zal has started building a proof of concept of a knowledge graph that contains projects in the regenerative web3 ecosystem, which can be seen [here](https://thick-nylon-eagle.fission.app/explore/). It displays projects curated by ReFiDAO, and how they relate to each other.  It can be explored visually and via a search bar which simply uses a text-based index.  The data is stored in a graph database so it has the capability to be updated and queried with a query language like graphQL.
- Engage relevant stakeholders in web3 and beyond to co-create a commons for stewarding the ontology and implementation of the solution. 
	- The partners listed below have already expressed interest in collaborating on regenerative web3 knowledge management 
		- Eco Labs: Building an app for onboarding changemakers into regenerative practices.  Interested in bioregionally contextual knowledge.
		- Ned Horning (Regen Network, ReSci Network): working on graph based ontology for regenerative ecosystem management methodologies and research analysis.
		- Jan Hendrik Scheufen: Builder and weaver helping to build an alliance for regen web3 network graphing. 
		- ReFiDAO: Building a knowledge graph for the ReFi ecosystem
	- An "ontology commons" - a collective approach to building the ontology and schemas for the decentralized graph. This will ensure a collaborative and dynamic development of the knowledge graph, allowing it to evolve and adapt to the needs of the community.
	- Expand the ontology to cover a broader range of relevant domains (topics, [questions, claims, evidence](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/fundamentals/what-is-a-discourse-graph), solutions, [constraints](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Constraint_mapping), people, events, etc). 
- Integrate data from various sources into services (queries, visualizations, discourse, recommendations, etc)
- Enable individuals to manage their identities and data using web3 wallets and decentralized storage/access management.
- Explore AI-assisted services, such as natural language chatbots and natural language-to-structured query translation.
- Decentralize the infrastructure using tools like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), [OriginTrail](https://twitter.com/origin_trail), and other decentralized databases and query services, ensuring resilience, transparency, and accessibility.
- Investigate regenerative business models to fairly compensate data providers while creating value through services like LLMs, recommendation systems, and search engines.

## Conclusion

A decentralized knowledge graph can help us foster collective intelligence and action to address the metacrisis.  Its ability to manage highly interconnected data can help humans and machines to symbiotically make sense of the interconnected and networked nature of the metacrisis. This comprehensive mapping empowers communities to make informed decisions and collaborate on effective solutions. By securing funding through this grant, we can begin the crucial work of weaving information into knowledge and knowledge into collective intelligence.
