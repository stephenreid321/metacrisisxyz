🌍 Bloom is a cyber-physical social network that helps people find and participate in grassroots climate actions where they live. https://bloomnetwork.earth

Today, we are 30,000 people on the ground in 22 local Bloom hubs across 9 countries doing rapid climate repair and adaptation.

👀 **Problem**

67% of people feel there is a climate emergency, but they don't know what they can do about it. Meanwhile, there are plenty of solutions happening on the ground, but they lack media visibility and funding, so they remain underground.

🌻 **Solution**

Local Bloom hubs connect existing projects in their region. They plant community gardens, teach people to form agroforestry co-ops, and build regional token economies focused on land and water stewardship. Online, we share knowledge P2P as a global community to implement climate repair more quickly and cost-effectively.

Here is a video produced by Diamante Bridge Collective, a local Bloom hub in Costa Rica. It tells the story of what's happening on the ground and how we use web3 to bridge the finance gap to local-led regeneration.

Bloom's social network is a vibrant hub for people to see the beautiful work happening around the planet, to flip mainstream narratives from fear to constructive, empowered action of caring for one another.

🌸🌸🌸 *Our goal for 2023: Welcome 100 new local Bloom hubs.* 🌸🌸🌸

**What will we buidl with funds contributed this year?**

Open general membership : Pilot our local/international member fee splits to jumpstart local Blooms : Complete our cooperative/DAO formation with the help of an all-women legal team. This will reduce risk for our longstanding communities as we teach them to use cryptocurrency : Implement our cooperative patronage token to reward members for doing regenerative actions.

**Since Gitcoin Alpha:**

Pilot planning with Kolektivo’s nature-backed stablecoin with Blooms in Diamante Valley, Costa Rica and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil : Completed gifts and needs feature and set up social chat for peer knowledge and resource sharing on Bloom Platform : Completed migration to Svelte 1.0 : Unlock membership subscription NFT is working in development : Onboarding new Blooms in Ohio, a network of small farms in the Northeast US, Denver, and Oregon 🌿


🎬 **Why Now**
