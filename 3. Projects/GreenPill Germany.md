# Intro:
GreenPill Germany strongly believes that lively human connections are vital for any community to thrive. We aim to create an intimate and relaxed atmosphere by keeping the number of members small and highly engaged. Together we aim to translate Web 3 Punk into real life solutions to some of our most pressing issues ranging from intense biodiversity loss to climate crisis.
 
 
# Mission Statement:
GreenPill Germanyâ€™s mission is to bring the benefits of decentralized and caring communities as well as crypto into the real world. Our national chapter aims to spread awareness about regenerative finance and social movements, bringing to life solutions that governments and people in centralized power structures fail to.
  
  
# Objectives:
1. Educate and create awareness among members about the possibilities of regenerative finance movements and their importance in our current failing system.
2. Create a community of people who feel a strong responsibility to help earth, its ecosystems and its people using up-to-date means and technology.
3. Interconnecting everybody even more through discussions, workshops and mentoring.
4. Translating the learned concepts and community support into the real world by starting green projects and businesses and getting them the funding needed!
 
 
# Roadmap for the next 3 months:
1. Build the GreenPill Germany Core Team
2. Onboard more Members to our community & Discord
3. Win Impact Incubators for hyperlocal Meetups
4. Create more ReFi Events in Hamburg, Berlin, Munich and Cologne
5. Create hands-on Masterclasses to engage Impact Communities in Germany
 
 
# Why Germany?
**General Climate Awareness:** Germany a country whose citizens take climate change and environmental issues seriously. People in Germany are more likely to be interested inregenerative finance and other sustainability movements, making it an ideal location for GreenPill Chapters.

**Climate Justice Movements:** Germany also has strong climate justice movements that seek to ensure that people are not disproportionately affected by climate change. GreenPill Chapters can contribute to this movement by promoting regenerative finance and cryptocurrencies as a way to support communities that are affected by climate change.

**Impact Investing:** Germany is one of the countries that have been leading the way in impact investing. We aim to tap into this trend and introduce people to the idea of investing in regenerative finance and cryptocurrencies as a way to create positive change.

**Social Entrepreneurship:** We have a thriving social entrepreneurship scene, where startups and organizations aim to create positive change. The GreenPill Germany Chapter is going to strongly support and collaborate with them!
 
 
# Structure and USPs of the upcoming Meetings:
We start off with daily Schilling Sessions in Twitter Spaces in collaboration with Solar Punk Guild starting the 24th of April. Every day the Space opens at 18:00 CET. We are aiming to create offline events in every major region of Germany. Though, until the community has grown more we will mainly focus on online group events and face to face calls with key figures as well as everybody who wants to be involved and contribute to saving the planet through community building and project engagement. 

During the first Schilling Sessions in the Twitter Spaces we will be talking with newcomers and OGs in the sector, giving everybody the opportunity to present themselves! Other topics will be: possible mentorships, brainstorming & connecting business ideas, Gitcoin fundraising and co-marketing.
