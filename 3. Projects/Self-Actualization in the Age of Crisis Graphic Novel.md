## Proposal Information

**Proposal summary:** A graphic novel detailing the central philosophies and practices contained in Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis.

**Abstract:** The intent of our proposal project is to create more accessible pathways to social cohesion and address societal polarization through the spread of reimagined frameworks of meaning and value informed by cosmology and physics. We will create a graphic novel based on Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis in collaboration with Diego Andrade whose artwork is featured in our banner. The project will support SpiritDAO’s mission of expanding access to information about the single truth and relational universe and alongside the efforts of our non-profit work will greatly widen the net of people interested in and entering the web3 public goods space.

**Motivation:** The metacrisis describes a plethora of challenges facing humanity. At SpiritDAO we believe the root of our struggle is our available frameworks of meaning and value which guide and frame human intent and interaction. In order to successfully overcome the crisis, we must bind spiritual renaissance and systemic reformation and system.  
We provide an alternative spiritual framework rooted in natural science to replace those that were designed for moments and a human experience far distance from our immediate present and the dominion philosophies they spread throughout the world.

Self-actualization in alignment with the single truth and relational universe provides an alternative framing of being that draws from natural authority, synthesizing spirit and science and binding it to systemic reformation.

Feedback from the original text’s soft launch has been extremely positive, with the most frequent critique being that the book’s length is a barrier to entry. To that end we want to distill the core concepts into a media format that will offer greater access and further our purpose of bringing more people into alignment with the pluralistic vision of humanity and being necessary to work towards the systems and coordination mechanisms necessary to overcome the crisis.

**Previous work on the proposal area:**
Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis (https://singletruth.org) develops new frameworks of meaning and value informed by cosmology and physics. It provides a nature-rooted framework for the non-religion religion, identifying universal commonality and developing new core values and systemic rights (the Eight Dignities) necessary to most fully embrace them.

Art partner Diego Andrade has an extensive history of creating beautiful art for a wide variety of projects include event/band posters, commercial projects, and most recently being a featured artist in the popular trading card game Magic: The Gathering.

## Specification

**Expected duration or delivery date (if applicable):** ~ 3 months from funding.
