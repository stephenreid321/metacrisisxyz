## Summary
The outside world sees crypto as little more than a decentralized casino but an optimistic counternarrative has emerged around the Gitcoin community. This vision, known as the Infinite Garden, reveals that crypto gives us coordination superpowers.

I believe that for the Greenpill mission to succeed, we must amplify regen stories that are informative, fun, and accessible to all.

## Overview
As a former Creative Director with Gitcoin, my art helped fundraise over half a million dollars for the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool since 2021. My focus on regen fiction has now shifted to cultivating the Infinite Garden vision through fun and accessible lore. In the project I am proposing, Moloch, Ether’s Phoenix, and the Dark Forest are just the beginning of a new, uplifting mythology represented in the Infinite Garden Library.

Crypto is at a critical inflection point. Your choice to invest in this project will help realize a positive-sum future for the following reasons:

- The next billion crypto users need inspiring and informative stories to guide them through the cryptoverse. Newcomers consistently fall for the same schemes and OGs can do a better job of passing along the wisdom of past cycles. The Infinite Garden mythology will feature relatable characters and lore that orient and guide new adventurers through the cryptoverse.
- The Infinite Garden mirrors reality. Every entry in the library (characters, technology, and environments) also represents a powerful force in the real world.
- New settlers are not the only people confused about web3; many crypto elders are still unaware that “Ethereum isn’t here to make you rich, Ethereum is here to set you free" (Vitalik Buterin). Beliefs motivate behavior and it is essential we make Gitcoin’s vision clear and attractive.
- Public goods awareness needs to increase in the NFT space. The NFT community has an outsized impact on how the world perceives crypto but our PFP frens are generally oblivious to the regen way. The Gitcoin x MetaLabels drop, Creature World collaboration, and PublicNouns projects have made promising headway and the Infinite Garden Library is the next step to trojan horse our regen crypto values.
- For those of us already Greenpilled: the Infinite Garden represents a celebration of the adventures that have brought us here–and an inspiring vision of what we hope to buidl together next.

## Specifications
The Infinite Garden Trading Card Game recently received seed funding from Gitcoin [GCP-006]. Funding from this quadratic grant will go to fund the public library of Infinite Garden Lore. More characters, environments, and artifacts that represent the most significant corners of our wild web3 adventure.
