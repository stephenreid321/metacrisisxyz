# An Open-Source Game to Popularize Web3

FBH is an education project that makes sci-fi content about complexity of the modern world to make it more accessible and understandable for everyone. 
Our ultimate goal is to generate widespread attention and excitement for ideas like: web3, refi, regen/degen, desci, despace, DAOs, etc. By creating engaging stories and games in the science fiction genre and using game mechanics and narrative, we are engaging people in the new economy in a fun and enjoyable manner.


The project is run by a group of three passionate individuals who use open-source software to create captivating stories that are available to all.
