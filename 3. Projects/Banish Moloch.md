The purpose of this project is to end the need for people to focus first and foremost on personal benefit by reminding society that its purpose is to meet everyone's needs independently of their utility. The way we will do this is with a series of educational and inspirational videos that will motivate people to become leaders in fostering decentralized free collaboration. 

The solution to the multi-polar trap is to align incentives by reminding all humanity that our shared goal is to meet everybody's needs. This is how we can assure nobody will be left out. This is how we make sure that there are no losers, so the dynamics of society is no longer rivalrous. As long as people refuse to provide for everyone independently of their utility, it is assumed that some people will win and some will lose. This in turn makes it impossible for people to care about anything but not being one of the losers, and so all values and long term thinking are a burden that have to be abandoned in order to win in the competition for resources and power. 
This will become even more apparent with AI that will have the capacity to replace most jobs. It is necessary that we clarify to all that everybody's objective is to meet everybody's needs, not "grow the economy", not create jobs, not reduce C02, not "beat china", not reduce inflation, not increase GDP nor "make paperclips". 

The videos we will create will do the following.

- Demonstrate the need to align humanity
- Demonstrate that humanity thrives when we are aligned
- Describe the science of human needs
- Demonstrate that voluntary and decentralized free collaboration is the most effective way to meet everybody's needs
- Show the capacity every individual has in influencing society 
- Give examples on how individuals can influence society to foster free collaboration

We are confident that once enough individuals are well inspired and educated on these subjects, institutions and public administration will follow and completely restructure society to empower everybody to live fulfilling and happy lives of sustainable abundance.
