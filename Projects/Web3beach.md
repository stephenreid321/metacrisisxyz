Accelerating web3 education and adoption through social and environmental impact. "Impact Onboarding" creates onramps and upward mobility in web3 for unbanked, disenfranchised, and historically overlooked communities. WEB3BEACH educates, coaches and empowers community leaders from diverse walks of life to use web3 tools in efforts to improve living conditions for all. This includes environmental impact, health services, education, recreation and the ability to carry out their own public goods initiatives through our mini grants program. As a byproducts, we're creating circular crypto economies in our communities. 

Since GR15: We've launched programs in five communities throughout Honduras and will continue to expand in 2023. We're also advising projects in other countries so they can adopt Impact Onboarding strategies in their region. 


🔍Transparency Reports: We include expense reports with all of our events and currently working towards creating a standardized grantee reporting process.

We'll continue to use all of our funding for our community programs and will begin compensating our community leaders for their work. Web3beach founder (Carlos Melgar) will continue to work without pay or benefits from grant funding.
