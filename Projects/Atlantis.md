Founded in 2022, Atlantis is a peer to peer impact network for builders, entrepreneurs and creators from the climate and social impact sector. 

We design and develop tools that help these Changemakers setup, measure and verify the impact from their social and green enterprises and projects.

Our current focus are Impact DAOs, NGOs and organisations who build climate solutions, decentralize science and tackle metacrisis.

## What have we done so far?

1. Created over 600 green jobs in the last one year, with majority of these jobs going to women from underserved communities in rural India.

## What is next for us?

### Focus on ground (Piloting the Atlantis Citizen App across multiple impact projects):

**1. Rebuilding Turkey** - Working with EarthistDAO and Anka Fund in Turkey - helping onground orgs NGOS to deploy and implement funds in a transparent manner across multiple rehabilitation and restoration projects. The partnership will involve using the Atlantis Citizen App to distribute the raised fund ($300,000) to numerous local organisations and carry out their impact work.  

**2. Public Goods Service** - With Solarpunk Nomads
Using an electric vehicle bought with Gitcoin funds we will conduct climate awareness drives across Bangalore colleges, educating students on opportunities and green jobs around #ReFi and #Web3. We also plan to conduct clean up drives across Atlantis Pilot locations in Gokarna and Chikmagalur.

**3. Tree Planting** - in collaboration with Treegens - mangrove planting along the coastlines of Western Ghats. We are currently working out permits that will allow the Treegen team to plant the trees. The entire operation will be captured on Atlantis Citizen App recording all the verifiable data points that will validate the onground efforts. 

**4. Provide subsidized water filters to 3000 people in Chikkamagaluru**, helping secure clean drinking water. We are looking to raise $3000 to complete this project. The water filters will be distributed among underserved communities in Chikmagalur with complete traceability.

### Focus on technology (Bringing additional features to the Atlantis Citizen App):

1. Develop Atlantis Impact Certificates - The Impact Certs provide real time and high context certificates to the investors and project developers for the impact work they do. The impact certificates will be are critical to incentivize and create value for a wide range of social and climate positive actions. 

2. Develop Atlantis Oracle in partnership with Lunarpunk Labs. The oracle is a sense making tool that helps identify the baseline for key planetary boundaries and other factors that will guide in setting up and developing micro regenerative economies across climate frontiers in the Global South.

## TEAM

Atlantis was founded by two mechanical engineers, Irthu and Nakul, decade-long friends who spent the last 5 years building climate solutions.
Their first venture, Hydrop, was a decentralised water network that served over 11,000 users in Bangalore. Bootstrapped and profitable, this helped them build out their bigger vision in the form of Atlantis.

Irthu S is a Mechanical Engineer and Product Designer with 10Y in Startup Saas and Ecommerce before getting into Climate tech.
Nakul R is a Mechanical Engineer, specialised in leading Operations and Finance.Before joining Irthu, Nakul spent over 5 years in the Aeronautical and Healthcare sector.

Over the last 5 years, both founders have accumulated vast experience building climate solutions on-ground across different terrains and geographies within India.
Today, there are over 12 core contributors and over 2000 community members across the world helping build Atlantis.
