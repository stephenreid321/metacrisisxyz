# TLDR: Your DAO needs Liberating Structures

## Your support will be funding our mission to **to spread the practice of Liberating Structures across ReFi/Regen web3**:
1. Continued P2P support
- Every Monday we host a call for coordinators [register here](https://lu.ma/3rsn4n4r)
- [40 previous sessions are on YouTube as social POW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnEMjx5Jb0mqcZkkUqp8EIYfp1hssqs)

2. Liberating Structures Learning Journey Masterclass
- Cohort of 12 community builders will learn how to organize, plan and host events participatory [register here](https://forms.gle/4zrygoUnieB85xDo9)
- Of the registered participants 62% have indicated that they would require a scholarship in order to participate

3. Organize a virtual hackathon
- Learners will showcase their skill by hosting a communication, coordination and collaboration festival
- [The Last cohort’s recital can be viewed here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnEMjx5Jb1pZtvoLpoVbHCq0S3OXsWb)

4. Development of a Proof of Learning Protocol

# What?

Liberating Structures(LS) are an open source toolkit of 33 conversation protocols. 
They are so effective and easy to use that, according to [SessionLab’s annual State of Facilitation survey](https://www.sessionlab.com/state-of-facilitation/), LS are the most used method used by pro facilitators. 
There are 9,316 members in the global slack, which are self-organized into 126 virtual and regional User Groups that plan, design and host practice sessions. 
The community has created countless free to use resources such as an app for ios and android. There are Youtube videos, medium articles, slide decks, free and paid training as well as many additional [LS in development](https://trello.com/b/9l6MUKTQ/ls-in-development) by users in the field.
This Learning Impact Network has grown in just 10 years with ZERO explicit organizational structure, no leadership team, not even a non-profit anywhere. Just a creative commons book translated by the community in 4 languages, a slack, a google drive and a shared calendar. With those primitives and the Surprising Power Of Liberating Structures, prosocial collaboration becomes possible.
LS are just instructions for how to have different types of conversations according to the following principles

# So What?

If your DAO wants to… 
+distribute agency, leadership and decision making
+increase diversity, equity, inclusion and participation 
+stop having meetings that waste time, go nowhere and make you want to kill yourself

I repeat: Your DAO needs Liberating Structures.

Since 2021 Wise Crowds has been helping bring Liberating Structures to the ReFi and Public Goods corner of web3 through the Liminal DAO, Token Engineering Commons, Gravity DAO, The DAOist, Schelling Point, ReFi DAO, Aragon DAO, the Crypto Commons Association, Metagame, Kernel, EF Devcon Bogota, Trusted Seed, re:build, DAO Brussels and Regens Unite. We’d love to help you learn as well. If you have attended an Unconference, the Open Space Technology that enabled the organization of time, attention and energy is a Liberating Structure.

# Now What?

The roadmap we’re working towards has one purpose: **to spread the practice of Liberating Structures throughout ReFi/Regen web3.** Our next time horizon leads us towards a “proof of learning protocol.” It solves some genuine problems of the existing LS community that you’ll recognize around reputation, attribution/recognition of work and funding. 

We believe that if we can offer solutions to this community’s challenges we can usher many skilled LS practitioners into web3.  There is already strong value alignment and expertise around participatory governance, the commons and regeneration. These agents can accelerate the practice of Liberating Structures across web3, helping us better coordinate.

So we will measure:
+ the rate of skill adoption
+ Which LS prove most useful to web3 natives
+ What additional tools, frameworks and skills make use of the protocol
+ How Hypercerts help attract retroactive funding of the spread of these public goods 

If we are right we’ll see broad recognition of the potential applications of LS in web3 and ample support here in the Beta round. We’ll continue with community support, host several more Learning Journeys. This will enable us to complete the protocol. With this in place we can onboard new DAO operators and coordinators into learning journey cohorts and grow a virtuous pyramid scheme of learning and knowledge sharing where “wen insight?” is the norm!

LFG!
