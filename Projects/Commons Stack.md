# 💡 TL;DR

Join us in revolutionizing the way impact-driven communities fund and govern their missions with the power of **a commons-inspired token economy**!

Commons Stack is paving the way toward a more sustainable world with innovative tools and protocols that enable **regenerative funding, commons governance, and community building**, which are crucial for addressing global metacrisis that threatens the stability and sustainability of economic, environmental, and social systems. 

Leveraging our success with the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436) and [Collaborative Economics](https://medium.com/commonsstack/a-non-violent-revolution-against-technocracy-53388b123936) for the [Token Engineering Commons (TEC)](https://tecommons.org/), we aim to further enable more communities to launch their own economies by refining, documenting, and promoting our open-source tools and protocols for creating **sustainable token economies and public good-focused initiatives**. 

After the successful launch of TEC (the first Commons deployed using design patterns), we are actively seeking new initiatives interested in implementing our design patterns. We can't wait to see more Commons launched across the globe!

# 🌏 WHAT IS COMMONS STACK?

Commons Stack started as **a think-tank primarily focused on crypto-economic primitives to underpin a design framework for a Commons, a tokenized community with a mission benefitting a public good.** We aspired to scale commons as a way to realign incentives with public goods. To achieve this, we elaborated cultural designs that reinforce commoning principles and create novel tools such as the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), [Conviction Voting (CV)](https://medium.com/commonsstack/conviction-voting-f6f83a5d392a) and the [Praise](https://givepraise.xyz/) reward and reputation system, which have come straight out of our research collaborations. We also use Collaborative Economics, a methodology for enabling the community to collectively propose, iterate and finalize the parameters of their Commons’ economy.

Our Commons design patterns are made up of a suite of cultural frameworks and a curated library of tools for governance, funding, proposal, analytics and initialization of a Commons. **We see the work of Elinor Ostrom as our North Star and set out to weave her principles of governing commons into the cultural fabric of a Commons.** Our Cultural Build defines practices for clear boundaries, conflict resolution, monitoring, participatory decision-making, and other principles. 


# 🏆 RECENT MILESTONES

- Helped ReFi DAO launch the [ReFi DAO Local Node Prize](https://mirror.xyz/0x7340F1a1e4e38F43d2FCC85cdb2b764de36B40c0/FABiu5AhpAR6LBLZxlGSfjOrHsHYj2J8VT4QJWPxbpk) to find a community in the Global South to establish a community-owned treasury, token, governance, and initiatives, with the goal of creating a regenerative startup ecosystem 

- Delivered inspiring talks on public goods coordination and regenerative economies at various blockchain events. Watch our co-founder Griff Green’s talk  **[“Combating the Metacrisis”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-q8zzpmxdg)**  at ETHDenver!

- Deployed the Token Engineering Commons (TEC)

- Launched the [Trusted Seed](https://trustedseed.org/) 

- Developed the edutainment program [Commons Simulator](https://sim.commonsstack.org/) 

- Supported BlockScience in open-sourcing [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/) 

While we’ve already had some success, we’ve only just begun. Our research continues. The lessons learned from a first field test, the TEC, are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our curated commons library of tools and processes continues to evolve. 

We did not get this far alone. We have collaborated on research and development with BlockScience, Blossom Labs, Metagov, Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Giveth, 1Hive, Aragon, Token Engineering Academy, Token Engineering Commons, General Magic and many others.

Much of our [Github activity](https://github.com/commons-stack) is collaborative. We work hand in hand with  [Token Engineering Commons](https://github.com/commonsbuild), [General Magic](https://github.com/GeneralMagicio), and [Praise](https://github.com/givepraise).


# 👥 OUR TEAM

We are committed to fostering an inclusive work environment and prioritizing diversity and inclusion in all of our initiatives. We have an 89% female team with five (5) individuals from diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds, including **women from the Philippines, Brazil, and Argentina**. We believe that our diverse perspectives and experiences make us better able to understand and address the needs of a broader range of users and stakeholders.

# 💰 PLANS FOR BETA ROUND FUNDING

Funding from the Beta Round will go towards programming for a **Commons Incubator**. The purpose of this program will be to educate on commons and commoning (introducing the work of Elinor Ostrom, Peter Barnes, David Bollier, LabGov urban commons, etc.). We have sketched out an 8-module program skeleton to introduce commoning, define the community’s vision, design token allocation for contributions to the mission, collaboratively design parameters for a fund raise and, lastly, design and launch an Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) for the community. A large part of our program will be focused on developing a strong culture and robust governance mechanisms designed by the community that will be governed by them.  

Additionally, donations to our project will fund the development of an open-source **ABC configuration dashboard**, allowing users to customize and configure various parameters of an ABC to create a primary market for their tokens. This revamped version of the [TEC co-developed dashboard](https://config.tecommons.org/config/2) will provide greater flexibility and control over the fundraising process, democratizing access to ABC-based projects.

Thank you for your generosity! 🙏
