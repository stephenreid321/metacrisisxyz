JournoDAO is developing a decentralized protocol to take advantage of four key characteristics that are common to both distributed systems and the ethos of journalism — Immutability, transparency, censorship resistance and a healthy suspicion of centralized power (decentralization).

This protocol does not necessarily involve the creation of a brand new distributed network or “Layer 1” blockchain like Ethereum, or even an L2, L3, sidechain or parachain built on top of one (although it could). Instead we’re beginning with the development or integration of a stack of tools that emphasize these characteristics to create a modern way of reporting the news that’s more sustainable, credible and accessible. In particular, this decentralized reporting stack should be user-friendly enough for citizen journalists and tiny newsrooms to utilize it.

Our stack will consist of tools that provide web3-based solutions to modernize each layer of the news-reporting process, from the funding/capital layer, fact-checking, working with anonymous sources and other editorial processes to publishing, marketing and audience development.

When fully deployed and decentralized, we could envision newsrooms worldwide operating in a DAO-like structure, with each functioning as a node in a global network of journalism DAOs. The result could be a 21st century wire service consisting of numerous collaborating but autonomous outlets spanning a wide variety of geographic areas, topics, affinity groups, subcultures and other organizing principles we haven’t even thought of yet.

While our mission is to revitalize journalism and our first use case is to develop a decentralized reporting stack, we believe that this protocol could also find applications in just about any space where there is a need for information and data production, sharing, documentation and verification. Possible uses cases could include compliance, small governments, elections, deepfake / AI detection and project management.
