1. TL;DR: 
The Effective Altruism (EA) movement has given raise to many projects working on Metacrisis (Existential risks).  There are a lot of similarities between the end goal of the web3/crypto community and the EA community. This overlap is very underexplored. Also, EA seems to have a lot of issues and is very centralized. We aim to decentralize the EA movement and explore the overlap by doing rigorous research. 

2. Intended use of funds:

The funds will be used to,

a. Develop a detailed research report on the impact of web3 / crypto tools on EA causes such as AI Risks, X-risks, EA community building etc. 
b. Develop a decentralized grant-making mechanism suitable for EA and use part of the funds to fund the long tail of EA projects. 
c. Onboard EA organizations and educate them about Web3 tools and crypto. 
c. Kickstart the organization and develop working groups to achieve the above. 

3. Why this is the right thing to focus on:
The movement is currently plagued with a lot of potential problems as highlighted in the whitepaper draft (linked in the website) and the development and adoption of decentralized solutions can enable effective altruism communities and orgs to operate more efficiently, and transparently.  By onboarding EA organizations to Web3 tools and building trustless grant-making mechanisms, we can advance the EA movement and fund more impactful projects. Furthermore, researching the impact of Web3 tools on key cause areas of effective altruism will help us better understand how these technologies can be used to achieve the most good.

4. More about the project

The Decentralized Effective Altruism (EA DAO) project is about utilizing web3 tools and decentralized structures to advance the effective altruism movement and to help solve the most pressing problems of humankind. 

The organization will be a decentralized hub to connect the EA and Web3 / Crypto communities. We aim to leverage the power and draw inspiration from each of these communities to do the most good and solve some of the biggest problems we face today and in the future. 

There is significant overlap between Web3 and EA in their thinking philosophies and if both these communities club their resources and visions we could hope to achieve better results in the future.

Aims of the organization are to, 

a.  Onboard EA organizations to web3 by providing education on Web3 tools and crypto. 
b. Develop decentralized grant-making mechanisms for EA and use them to fund a long-tail of EA projects. 
c. Research the impact of Web3 tools/crypto on key cause areas of  Effective Altruism such as AI, existential risks, EA community building, etc.  

The impact the organization aims to have is,

a. To decentralize the EA community and movement, 
b. To create a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable EA movement by leveraging the power of Web3 tools to increase transparency, accountability, and impact.
