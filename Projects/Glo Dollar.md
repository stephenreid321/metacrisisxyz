**Glo Dollar** is a fully backed, nonprofit stablecoin that generates basic income for people in extreme poverty. 


How this works: 
* Glo Dollar’s reserves will be held in a mix of cash and Treasury Bills;
* Treasury Bills generate interest;
* Glo Dollar gives that yield away to [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), an NGO that distributes basic income to people in extreme poverty. 


We estimate that every $18,000 of Glo Dollar in circulation will [lift a single person out of poverty](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/the-numbers). Accordingly, an $18 billion stablecoin would lift 1 million people out of poverty every year. If Glo Dollar reaches USDT’s current market cap, that number rises to 4.5 million people.


As the first nonprofit stablecoin, Glo Dollar’s aim is to generate at least $1 of revenue for GiveDirectly for every dollar spent on operations. We think this is eminently possible. By our estimates, a stablecoin with a healthy mix of cash and T-bills will create a yield of about [2.7% for every dollar of market cap](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/how-it-works). We also project that a stablecoin with a market cap of $2 billion can operate on 1% of market cap per year. If we give away 2.7% and fund that 1% through donations, then every dollar donated or granted to Glo Dollar will create $2.70 of revenue for GiveDirectly, which in turn becomes about $2.30 of basic income for someone in extreme poverty. As market cap grows, we expect this multiplier to grow larger.

### The Extreme Poverty Metacrisis


Extreme poverty is a profound collective action problem. Eradicating extreme poverty would clearly benefit the extremely poor, whose lives are made very challenging by deprivation. But everyone else would also benefit from:
* more trading partners, and therefore more economic growth;
* more productive employees and employers (fewer people toiling in subsistence agriculture);

* and, most importantly, more unleashing of human capital – if the next Einstein is born somewhere poor and remote, we all would benefit from her having access to education through the university level.


And yet, as of now, 700 million people live in extreme poverty. The reasons for this are complex, but the core problem is that lifting everyone out of extreme poverty would benefit the entire earth, but no individual or institution can expect to reap adequate rewards to justify internalizing the costs (financial and otherwise) of making it happen.


The Glo Dollar is a nonprofit stablecoin that aims to solve this problem. Research on cash transfers shows that basic income is transformational for people in extreme poverty (see GiveDirectly's [research page](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly) for more information). Because of our nonprofit structure, every dollar held as Glo Dollar goes towards solving the extreme poverty metacrisis.
