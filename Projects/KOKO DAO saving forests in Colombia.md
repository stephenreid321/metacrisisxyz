# KOKO DAO is on a mission to reduce deforestation in Colombia 🇨🇴 #

We work closely with local rural communities to create viable economic models as an alternative to deforestation 🐒🌳

🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳

**TL;DR**

**Why?**

Colombia is the second-most biodiverse country in the world, with 50% of its territory covered in vegetation. However, we lose more than 500 hectares of forest to deforestation daily. 

🌱 **Goals**

1. Preserve *¨400 hectares of endangered native forest** using avoided deforestation on-chain credits in Huila, Colombia.
1. Onboard farmers and rural community leaders to the **KOKO DAO Impact Hub**, where they will be part of the first ReFi (Regenerative Finance) Cohort in **Spanish**. 

🔥🪓 **Causes of deforestation**

- Lack of opportunities apart from cattle farming and extensive agriculture.
- High barriers of entry to the traditional carbon market.
- Rising involvement in illegal drug production and violence associated with organized crime.
- Increase in costs of agricultural production.
- Lack of environmental education and internet connectivity.

💰 **How is the money being used?**

1. Development of KOKO DAO’s Impact Hub.
1. Design of the first ReFi cohort in Spanish, which onboards farmers, local leaders, and students. 
1. Incentives to provide cohort participants with internet access. 
1. First pilot project developed in partnership with a Web3 dMRV project developer (15 hectares of native forest).
1. Legal expenses.
