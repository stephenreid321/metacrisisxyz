# PostCapitalist traveling school in Latin America


[Campaña en español aquí](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJDfoe5bJpAveDg34F_41TKBGjOFBYf7pTLEmbHphqk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Thanks to you, we have already created an immersive course** on the above topics [check our website](https://urbanika.notion.site/), **now we want to take this gamified learning experience from online to IRL**. The below description unfolds the proposal:


**What**: Traveling school and artistic fair: workshops, meetUps, and movie nights for changemakers


**Impact**: Graduate 300 changemakers in smart, ethical, and regenerative city making [more info below]


**Where**: 40 latin american cities [listed at the end]


**When**: Starting in 2023 and up to reaching the 40 cities (~2025)


**How**: Turning a bus into a traveling educational and artistic fair [see photos below] in the style of [LaBitcoineta](https://www.youtube.com/LaBitcoineta), but spreading the word of a multichain world, ReFi, and the Commons.


**Why**: The ReFi, PostCapitalist, and SolarPunk concepts are far away from becoming IRL movements. Most of these concepts are foreign to IRL communities of changemakers. We need to attract and help them transform their cities into ethical, smart, and regenerative places to live.


**How much**: $15,950


**300 changemakers**
From the trip and events (described below) we aim to onboard 300 changemakers into Blockchain, AI, and PostCapitalist practices so they can apply this knowledge to transforming their cities ethically and regeneratively.


Every attendee of our events will receive a POAP and an Ethereum Attestation Service badge. These attestations will provide evidence of the impact (number of people onboarded) at each city.

# Workshops, MeetUps, and Movie nights


There are three types of events we will host at least once in every city:

🛠**Workshops**: Urbánika’s online course comes IRL. 1.5 hr sessions covering Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and PostCapitalism. Tests and challenges come up with the sessions to motivate attendees to apply the lessons learned.

We will also have in our agenda attending all the Latin American EVM, AI, and PostCapitalist related conferences that we can, performing dedicated workshops, side-events, and artistics fairs there.

The amazing DAOist México event gave us the inspiration to envision the urban workshops, although with us the tent will be coming from the roof of the bus 😉

**Imagine activism workshops delivered "at your street":**

🤝**MeetUps**: Social gatherings to meet like-minded people, discover synergies, and enjoy the vibe. These events feature local artists, a ReFi NFT gallery, as well a couple of stands from local producers.

They designed a type of stand that is portable and easy to set up. We already have the model to craft a pair of them.

**Imagine meetups popping out in different urban places like parks or public squares!**

🌃**Movie nights**: Movie nights: We’ve gathered a large collection of well-produced provocative movies that cover land grabbing, water theft, corporatization of food, the patenting of shared wealth, and other ones. Our goal is to spark both conversation and action among attendees.

**Can you imagine these movie nights reaching your city with the bus like this?**

# 💰What are our costs and How are we using the funds?

Cost of buying a school bus in México =  $13,000
Cost of the infrastructure needed for becoming a traveling school and artistic fair = $2,950

There are other costs not included in this grant, such as performing the workshops, meetups, and movie nights, traveling, and turning the bus into a nice place to travel for that long…BUT the idea here is to fundraise only the minimum required to buy and transform the bus into the traveling school and artistic fair we envision.

Reaching the minimum $15,950 USD goal will allow us to get started traveling and performing events in the first cities within México meanwhile we fundraise for the rest of the adventure!

Today, we would appreciate from the bottom of our hearts your help to reach this goal 🙏

If you have questions such as what are the calculated costs for the whole trip, the impact monitoring, the property rights of the bus, and others, check the FAQ 👇



## FAQ
If you didn’t find an answer to a question you have, shoot it at our Twitter and Lenster DMs! they are open 🙂

 **How are you going to watch the impact of this grant?**
All events are going to appear online through Lens and Twitter. After each event, all attendees will receive a [POAP](https://poap.xyz/) and an attestation made with [EAS](https://easscan.org/).

All the supporters of this grant will receive a link to the photos and videos of each event, along with the directory of EAS and POAPs issued.

 **Private property or ~~public good~~ commons?**
If the bus is completely financed by this grant, our donors will choose a foundation to which to transfer its ownership.

The foundations to choose from are the [Crypto Commons Association](https://www.crypto-commons.org/crypto-commons-association) and the [Commons Stack Association](https://member.commonsstack.foundation/).

The chosen association will have the right to take it away in the case we stop providing the educational purposes we promised in here.

**What happens if we don’t reach the 15,950 USD goal?**
We will continue fundraising. What answer did you expect?

**How can we achieve it?**
Easy with your help! If 350 people support us with 5 USD we could access a quadratic matching enough to reach the goal. We've seen it in past rounds.

Would you help us reaching this goal, ´please?

**Oh! and if you are wondering “how can we make our education campaign financially sustainable?” We have thought several ways:**
- Selling certifications and additional benefits for apprentices taking the online course (this is already running),
- Selling food and beverages in the meetups, workshops, and movie nights,
- Performing events on demand -for universities, conferences, etc, that would like to have a specific workshop or conference about a topic,
- Partnerships and sponsorships with value-aligned initiatives,
- Running some dAppNodes, and oracles.

**What are the topics to cover within the workshops?**
The topics come from Urbánika’s online course. But, there’s a difference, the IRL sessions are 3-session long and the online one is 10 sessions-long.

**What are the goals of the IRL blockchain sessions?**
Guide attendees from understanding the differences between web3 and web 3.0 to setting up a Gitcoin Passport, and supporting a couple of projects.

**What are the goals of only giving three sessions?**
We aim to encourage attendees to continue their education through Urbánika’s online course, which is free! and which blockchain course ends up with a challenge specific to the role of the changemaker [more below]

**What are the goals of Urbánika?**
We dream of having at least 300 graduates that can generate a change in their communities. Our final challenges aim to graduate changemakers by:

- DAOifying an urban commons,
- Startup a local commons instead of a company,
- Draft and promote a commons-oriented public policy.

**What is the list of cities to visit?**
![list of cities to visit](https://bafybeidnfxuqhd5ahvx6e57x5qlwjn5ug6siccj3k4ke4wlvovi54amuna.ipfs.w3s.link/List%20of%20cities%20to%20visit.png)
Invite us to yours! We might add a few or a ton more, who knows!


**What do we do if we get more than we are asking?**
$15,950 USD is the bare minimum to kickstart this IRL traveling school, however, we still need to cover other things, so if we receive more than the 14K we will use them accordingly to cover the following goals:

1. **Training**;
- Cost of performing three workshopping sessions (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) of 1.5 hrs each day = $270 USD (it includes the creation and distribution of attestations).
- Cost of *printing handbooks of Urbánika’s course = $3 per 10 people = $30 USD
Total of $300/city, per 40 cities = $12,000 USD

Note: Handling printed copies is to overcome the obstacles that poor access to the internet or to fast electronic devices can be.

2. **travel-living conversion**
- the cost is of turning a school bus into a living space to travel with dignity for 2 years is of ~ $20K USD

3. **from diesel to electric conversion**
- We’ve calculated an average of $300 USD to travel from city to city, per 40 cities = $12,000 USD. Turning the bus into fully solar-powered costs ~$25,000 USD…
- So, for the cost of 4 years of diesel traveling, the bus can get 5-7 years of traveling with solar-power and zero-emissions! Traveling with the bus will directly let urban managers know that electric and solar-powered public transportation is a reality today.


**Would the bus be useful after the initial 2-5 years of traveling?**
Heck yes! We are nomads and we have a laser-level purpose: educating changemakers to facilitate systemic change into adopting regenerative ways of living.

So after traveling all through Latam we might go to Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. And in the worst case scenario, if by any chance our journeys are halted, the bus will be ready for others to take it and continue using it for public good, as the property will be held by a foundation, and not us!

Basically, you are funding a solar-powered traveling school for systemic change!

If you want to know more ask us in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xUrbanika), [Lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/urbanika), or directly check our website: [urbanika.notion.site](http://urbanika.notion.site)

**Do you want that your local policy makers, entrepreneurs, and activists learn how to use exponential tech in ethical, fair, and regenerative ways?**
**Then, please support Urbánika's traveling school with a donation, as well as sharing this campaign with your friends!!**
