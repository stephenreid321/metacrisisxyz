This is a proposed interactive online course to provide a general overview of the meta-crisis and to get into some of the intricacies of what people can do to address the greatest and most complex ecological, socio-cultural, and political challenges of our time.  

How do we meaningfully address these multiple overlapping and interconnected crises, which we can call the meta-crisis?  We keep degrading our environment and there is a breakdown of socio-cultural cohesion and apparent instability of our political and economic institutions.

The purpose of this course would be to train community leaders, evolutionary change-makers, and social entrepreneurs who would then be in a better position to innovate, organize, and help bring about the foundational changes that we need in order to meaningfully address the meta-crisis.  

There is already a vast amount of information available on the meta-crisis in the form of books, articles, podcasts, and videos.  This course will summarize this information and synthesize it and present it to people in a way that is understandable, inspiring, and actionable for course participants.  This course is not just for identifying problems but it also giving participants the tools to begin making some significant differences and working toward tangible positive change in our highly complex world.

Cost: $500-600 per seat

All grant funds will be used to create the educational content and set up the course.  The course costs will be used to pay the course teachers and the platform costs as well.

Platform: This could be delivered via Mighty Networks in partnership with networks such as Emerge and A New Republic of the Heart

Length: Twice-weekly 2 hour sessions for 10 weeks.  

Each of these will be interactive with the teacher and all other students.  There will also be direct 1 on 1 coaching for each participant.  Course materials will be assigned to each participant, including a class project wherein they will be required to formulate an action plan for addressing the meta-crisis, which they will present to the class.

We might have different versions of this course for different sophistication levels, where some of them would be more advanced and some would be beginner or intermediate level.

Part 1: Framing the meta-crisis

Part 2: Some common but simplistic responses to the meta-crisis
 
Part 3: Using game theory and complexity thinking to understand the problem space and the potential solution space
 
Part 4: Assessing the integrative and metamodern approaches addressing the meta-crisis
 
Part 5: What would an optimal comprehensive solution look like?
 
Part 6: What are some of the organizations doing these things and what specifically are they doing to address the meta-crisis?  What is their implementation?  What can you do?  This is where some of the original research of the course teacher would be presented and also each participant would be given the opportunity to present their research, ideas, and findings.
