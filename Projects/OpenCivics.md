## 

OpenCivics convenes and facilitates a civic innovation network of leaders, innovators, change agents, and public servants actualized in service to the public good. Together we form a research and development consortium by connecting projects and organizations in an open collaborative ecosystem.  This decentralized institution utilizes collaborative design and governance processes to generate actionable solutions to outstanding public needs and critical civilizational challenges. 

Through synchronizing independent actors in their shared purposes and creating synergy through frameworks of agreement that promote trust and transparency, OpenCivics empowers a return to the origin of civics as the sacred and shared responsibility to engage the public in co-creating a participatory, vital and resilient civilization.
