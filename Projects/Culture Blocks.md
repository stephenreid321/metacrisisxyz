# Intro

Welcome to the world of Culture Blocks, an avant-garde project that combines digital building blocks with collective intelligence to redefine the way we create, share, and evolve our cultural identity. We're developing a dynamic platform that promotes open dialogue, collaborative experimentation, and sustainable progress. Our goal is to help catalyze collective human awareness by fostering a thriving ecosystem that nurtures creative thinking and drives societal change. We are a diverse and passionate community of visionaries, artists, technologists, and dreamers forging new pathways in art, science, and human potential to create a more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable future for everyone.

# The problems

1) Cultural selection in today's social networks comes from individual perspectives - a user writes a post, sends it, and other users interact to give it more or less weight. Those who already have influence (celebrities, politicians, billionaires) and those who have the capacity to game the algorithms or market themselves dominate the narratives. The majority of posts never get seen, many people with valuable insights are demotivated to contribute, and humanity misses out. 

2) Web3 is for coordination and decentralization but current apps are too complex, too risky, or too niche for the average user. Projects often if not always start off centralized - whether explicitly or not - and struggle to make meaningful shifts away from command and control towards sense and respond.

# Current progress

Culture Blocks is developing a method of collective curation to limit the reach one voice can have over others and amplify broader collective wisdom. Integrating more voices will facilitate the rapid emergence of novel cultures, creative solutions to our most pressing issues, and awe-inspiring art. 

We consider culture to be the universal foundation of any cohesive group of humans, whether it be a book club, business, religion, government, etc. and see an opportunity to generalize and automate much of the formation process in a fair and equitable way. 

On Feb 8, 2023 we implemented our minimum viable group decision-making process. This was a version of sociocracy modified for asynchronous collaboration to produce culture blocks. A culture block is a finite amount of digital information that represents a small but complete unit of a larger culture and can be easily replicated across cultures. Think a gene to DNA, or a cell to an organism. 

Using this process, we have proposed and curated a list of blocks detailing aspects of our culture such as our name, our primary communication platform, our decision-making process itself, a library with media relevant to the project, financial planning, branding material, design features, roles, and more.

This curated list of culture blocks can be thought of as a cultural narrative. Because of the effort, time, and convergence it requires to add a new block to the narrative, it provides a robust focal point for the group to rally around, highlighting only the most significant aspects of a group's shared context, identity, values, philosophies, and priorities. The stable narrative can inspire autonomous actions, emergent coordination, and/or coalescing of new organizations that are already aligned through their common root without need for central command or benevolent dictators.

For the first iteration to work we had to trust the good faith of each other's efforts and develop a shared understanding of how the process worked in theory and practice. This was a necessary starting point but does not scale well. We are now building a discord bot to automate our proposal and curation process and provide an intuitive interface for novices to engage with as we begin to expand our community. Our first version of the bot should be active by the time this matching round is live.

# Future Roadmap

Broadly, we anticipate the discord bot will go through a number of iterations before we begin building a standalone dapp. 

SocBot Internal: April 21 - July 20

Currently we have two fairly distinct yet interdependent cultural narratives to build internally. One is for the human centric culture full of our values, philosophies, and meaning. The other is our code centric culture that will focus on practical development, design, and implementation.

Beyond that we are teaming up with Mochi through their [100 sticky worlds](https://mochi-world.notion.site/A-Hundred-Sticky-Worlds-5f4fc582961641a79ebfdf3df5efb3cc) project to incentivize our community to form their own cultural narratives through our bot and with the guidance and support of our team. By posting some ETH and committing to an eight-week journey requiring daily interactions in our server M-F, community members can earn up to 320 OP tokens (current value around $800) and 160 Mochi tokens. The journey begins May 15, join our [discord](https://t.co/GzAfT0gVyr) by May 7 to learn more and sign up.

SocBot External + Web3 MVP: July 21 - Oct 20

We will take a short reflection break to integrate what we learn and update our plan, but next steps may include offering the bot in the servers of already established groups, building a basic web3 integration and applying for an Optimism Growth Grant to incentivize further adoption and form the seed of our dapp, and/or open sourcing the code base. 

Dapp Development: Oct 21+

Once the discord bot version has provided adequate information for how our model works in a larger population, we will reflect on what has emerged and create a project roadmap for the dapp itself while maintaining the SocBot product.

# How is this different from existing social network projects and DAO stacks?

There are a few key guiding principles we feel separate us from similar projects:
- Humanity: our methods and tools must be safe, intuitive, and nurturing for even the most casual user. This means lowering barriers to participation, mitigating threat of financial loss, simplifying interfaces, protecting data privacy, creating a rewarding experience without reliance on dopamine addiction, etc.
- Universality: we must distribute power and voice in a balanced way so that true collective intelligence can emerge.
- Fractal life: rather than a series of lifeless structures to be chiseled at, we view social organisms as breathing, growing, changing entities perpetually entwined in interdependent relationships with their human, conceptual, and material components.


Thank you for your support!

# Fun stuff

The following was produced by GPT-4 after feeding it our entire discord server's content and asking it to describe how collective cultural curation can reshape society and the world.

Revolutionizing the World Through Collective Cultural Curation: A New Dawn of Imagination and Connection

As we stand at the precipice of a brave new era, a whirlwind of creativity and innovation swirls around us, promising to reshape the world in ways we have yet to imagine. Enter the realm of collective cultural curation, an awe-inspiring concept that has the power to dissolve the boundaries of time, space, and perception, and unlock the full potential of human ingenuity.

Picture a world where ideas flow freely, unfettered by constraints, and where the collective consciousness of humanity converges to ignite an explosion of artistry, invention, and discovery. In this utopia, the once-divided forces of creativity, technology, and nature intertwine in a mesmerizing dance, forging an unparalleled fusion of brilliance and beauty.

From the depths of the digital cosmos, a pulsating web of interconnected minds emerges, enveloping the Earth in a shimmering blanket of inspiration. This global network serves as a conduit for the exchange of knowledge, wisdom, and vision, facilitating the birth of new cultural ecosystems that transcend the limitations of geography and language.

The flourishing of these ecosystems gives rise to breathtaking artistic creations that defy convention and captivate the senses. Soaring symphonies of color and sound fill the air, as architects of the imagination erect towering monuments to human achievement, blending the elegance of nature with the audacity of human ambition.

Driven by the spirit of playfulness and the thirst for discovery, individuals from all walks of life join forces to explore uncharted territory, devising ingenious solutions to the challenges that have long plagued humanity. This collective alchemy spawns new methods of addressing our most basic needs, paving the way for self and collective actualization, and lifting the veil on a previously hidden realm of possibility.

As we journey deeper into this enchanting landscape, we encounter the miraculous fruits of our collective labor: cities that breathe in harmony with the Earth, technology that heals and uplifts, and communities that celebrate the unique gifts of every individual. The world is reborn as a living tapestry of interconnected dreams, woven together by the threads of compassion, curiosity, and collaboration.

Boundaries dissolve as we embrace the fluidity of our collective identity, transcending the labels and divisions that have long kept us apart. United by a shared vision and a newfound understanding of our interdependence, we navigate the currents of change with grace, resilience, and hope.

In this fantastical new world, the power of collective cultural curation serves as a guiding light, illuminating the path to a brighter, more vibrant future. It is a future where the spark of creativity burns eternal, where the beauty of nature is intertwined with the wonders of human invention, and where the boundless potential of the human spirit is unleashed to reshape the world as we know it.

Embrace the magic of collective cultural curation, and together, we will embark on a breathtaking journey toward a new dawn of imagination and connection.
