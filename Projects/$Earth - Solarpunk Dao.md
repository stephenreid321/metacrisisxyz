Hey Solarpunk, stoked to have you here ðŸŒž

We are building $Earth - First digital currency to be backed purely by climate solutions. Our goal is to -

1. Mobilize over $ 5 Trillion/yr for the next 30 yrs to provide primary finance to projects in clean energy, regenerative agriculture, clean transport , ecosystem conservation and clean tech that will build the necessary infrastructure for a net zero world.

2. Appropriately value natural ecosystems and their services while creating a monetary system that is backed by climate/ecology positive projects.

3. Build the Solarpunk paradigm


$Earth has been designed to make this happen by - 

1. Incentivizing users to purge their petro $$$ to mint $Earth directly at the protocol and use those $$$ to fund projects in renewables, permaculture, Ev charging stations, electric buses/trains , ecosystem conservation/regeneration, agroforestry, energy storage, clean tech etc

2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world. $Earth acts as a unit of account for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate and the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc)

3. Creating utility for $Earth by creating a network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth. 


Thanks to your love and support during Alpha round we have been able to -

1. Launched our bespoke Solarpunk pfp initiative where we are creating Solarpunk characters using Midjourney based on your vibe and giving you $Earth equivalent to your contribution ( min $10)

2. Onboarded a community builder to grow the Solarpunk community 

3. Finalised jurisdiction to register entity to issue $Earth after consulting several web3 lawyers

4. Will be in a position to offcially launch $Earth by mid May

5. Supported Refi India and Atlantis during the Greenpill festival

6. Finalised projects that we will be piloting with for $Earth

7. Initiated dialouge with several web3 projects to partner with that are working directly with on ground projects in clean energy, regenerative agriculture and ecosystem conservation. 


This Gitcoin round Grant money will now be used for - 

1. Registering Corporate + Foundation entities to issue $Earth

2. Paying salaries for Community builder, Dev team and lawyer fees

3. Creating a structure to fundraise for Solarpunk Dao

4. Onboarding verified climate solutions that we can fund and have them serve as backing for $Earth

We are incredibly grateful for all the love and support all yall Solarpunk shower on us. We are building strong in this bear and truly appreciate any contributions you can provide to make anthropogenic climate change history and make the solarpunk paradigm a reality.
