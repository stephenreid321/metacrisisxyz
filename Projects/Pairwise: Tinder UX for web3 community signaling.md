Say goodbye to endless forum scrolling and hello to easy, efficient and fun community signaling with Pairwise! Our open-source, snapshot-style voting dapp, based on the [big brain algorithm research out of Colony in 2018](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/), offers a fast-paced and intuitive experience, perfect for the next generation of DAOs. Join us in revolutionizing governance with the power of algorithms and give your community a fun way to engage in governance, as opposed to boring old voting..

Pairwise turns web3 voting into swiping on Tinder. Compatible with all EVM chains and fully open-source, our project is in active development but needs support!

**Problem**

Current voting mechanisms provide poor user experience and require a high cognitive overhead leading to intense voter apathy.

![|358x315](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P9sY5D_EPNs4LSQ3r5MdRxL1m8SbuWocDZ62oXd8zU3Ar4HiTDrPc9dDGHjwbJxLec7-EO4VGcuX0_DjNu8vYrRj9eX0OYV8EDD6LT6tx1v38mQ-BozvSlO-1ztyigpxCYjnKror_lzy2ty8XkZL7wQ)

As an ecosystem, we expect community members to spend a lot of time reading forum posts and have designed our tooling around this expectation. This will not scale.

**Solution**

Pairwise is a novel voting pattern and [dapp](https://pairwise.generalmagic.io/) that makes it easy and fun for web3 communities to signal their preferences. If this project can be well funded, it will enable much greater engagement for web3 communities across the ecosystem.

Pairwise aims to make it easier for Web3 communities to signal their preferences and make informed decisions. Pairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, like a dating app, allowing users to choose between pairs of options to signal their preferences as opposed to having to read endless forum posts and vote within a set time period. The system converts these simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and cognitive burden of voting.

Pairwise will be implemented as a [dapp](https://pairwise.generalmagic.io/) with its own front end and an open-source backend that can be used in various contexts, such as community governance or project funding with custom front ends. Pairwise voting will be compatible with all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and the development will be fully open source, and will also include documentation for developers who want to use the system in their own projects.

The goal of the project is to promote greater community engagement in DAO’s decision-making processes. But not only can Pairwise be used for governance with different snapshot strategies, but Pairwise can also be used to allocate budgets based on community signaling. And that’s just the beginning - we can’t wait to see how the community will discover and utilize all of the potential use cases for this tool.

Pairwise has the potential to significantly support global coordination efforts and address the metacrisis by simplifying and enhancing community engagement in decision-making processes. By transforming web3 voting into a more intuitive and enjoyable experience, Pairwise encourages greater participation from diverse stakeholders in crucial discussions and decisions. As a result, it fosters collaboration, information sharing, and collective problem-solving, which are essential for tackling the complex, interconnected challenges that define the metacrisis.

We are confident that this project has the potential to make a significant impact and we look forward to the opportunity to bring Pairwise voting to life with your support.

**Differentiation (from other projects)**

Pairwise is similar to Snapshot, but with a specific type of UX. Snapshot votes are built around the expectation that users will go do research in forums and read long-form discussions. Our approach leans into the fact that most of the community isn’t even going to skim the forum posts and will vote with their gut. The goal is to give a clearer signal of what the community wants through more engagement in fun and simple micro-decisions.

Pairwise shouldn’t be used for EVERY decision, but we believe it is an important complement to the current voting applications that exist today.

At General Magic, we believe in the power of collaboration in the open-source world. That's why we would be thrilled if Snapshot chose to integrate Pairwise into their platform. However, even if Snapshot decides not to, we are still committed to deploying this feature independently and integrating Snapshot's strategies into our system. We believe that this will benefit the entire governance ecosystem as we work together to create more efficient methods based on algorithms.
