Shifting civilizational priorities

> Make the world work, for 100% of humanity (even the 1%), in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.

# Global coordination

The UN was created in 1945 after WW2

The League of Nations was created in 1920 after WW1

Democracy didn't get updated since ancient Greece.

Representative democracy is a governance technology that was valid in 1776 _(declaration of independence)_ when information was traveling at the speed of a horse, actually ships were faster.

Now we have internet, blockchain, real-time data, COVID, climate emergency, fake news and Big Tech with lobbying budget bigger than GDP of a country...
