ReFi Miami is building a public, private and third-sector coalition to realize the vision of a Regenerative Miami by 2050. 

Sparked by the community behind #SaveMiami and SilviProtocol, ReFi Miami is a convergence of thought leaders across technology, science, finance, government, wellness, art, music and education. Our vision is to bring together the right people, tools and capital to help Miami overcome the myriad of challenges facing our wonderful city: climate change, social injustice, biodiversity collapse, AI-risk and more…

We see ourselves as a pioneer of the global regenerative movement and as a model for coastal cities around the world. Many years of preparation has been getting us ready for this moment.

    The moment is now!

We are kicking off ReFi Miami at an Earth Day Climate Collabothon on April 22 via #SaveMiami organized by Logos Blue Foundation, Sustainacities and partners.

        The Challenges

As recently as last week flooding in Miami Dade County has brought to all of our attention: Climate and environmental change and its complex web of crisis is real. It is not a distant future. It is facing us now and especially palpable in Miami

- Miami's watershed is being destroyed 💧
- Biscayne Bay is dying ❌
- High temperatures are going up at an alarming rate 🥵
- Farming is destroying land & polluting waters ☠️

We are now forced to monitor air quality & heat data in order to make sense of the rising toxicity and it’s impact on our environment and our residents. 🤢

Our time is running out ⌛️

With one of the highest property prices in the United States (and in the world), we have a significant cost to inaction, and inadequate action for the climate crisis that is at han

        Major Opportunities

The time is ripe for a regenerative village at the heart of the city of Miami. We are gathering the brightest minds and the most value-aligned capital into the work of regeneration.

Below is just a list of the amazing innititaitves between public, private and third-sector institutions emerging in Miami. 


- Miami has adopted a 1 million tree commitment
- Miami-Dade County adopted the Climate Change Action Plan (reduce emissions by 80% by 2050).
- Miami-Dade County founded a Resilience Office to focus on climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness.
- Miami has become a hub for web3, with several major companies setting up shop in the area along with the world’s largest Bitcoin conference
- Miami-based Knight Foundation has committed $10 million to climate solutions in the region.
- Harvard Business School Professors created a case study on Miami as an ideal hub for climate solutions that could be exported to the rest of the world.
- Florida International University (FIU) has a Sea Level Solutions Center that focuses on sea-level rise and resiliency.
- University of Miami (UM)’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science researces climate change and oceanography.

Overall, there is a strong interest and growing momentum in the Miami area towards regenerative practices, sustainable and regenerative finance, and the development of web3/crypto ecosystem.
