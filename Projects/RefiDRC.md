The Mission of ReFiDRC is to protect the environment and support local people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a shelling point for the global ReFi Community and the local community on the ground.

This movement includes a response to the Ministry of Hydrocarbons’ invitation
 to oil & gas companies to bid on 30 tracts of pristine rainforest, totaling over 800,000 sq-km.

We believe that the land is the country’s natural wealth and should be preserved, not extracted.

The funds from this Grants Round will be used in a couple of ways. 

Set up a ReFi Local Node in DRC to gather the local regens and environmental players. 

Set up a legal entity to put together a crypto bid in partnership with EQX Biome to bid on some of the 30 tracts of pristine rainforest that can be used to create a regenerative financial ecosystem in the DRC

Fund the partners who are preserving the Congo Basin and their needs.

With RefiDRC, local forest guardian populations will be able to easily access green funds in order to continue to ensure their saving mission of reforestation, restoration, and preservation of forests and biodiversity in the Congo Basin.

Supporting Facts:
~74% of the adult population (~40M ppl), do not have access to the formal financial system and are therefore limited in their ability to grow and develop their economic endeavors because they do not have bank accounts.

Africa’s cryptocurrency market had grown over 1,200 percent from 2020 to 2021. The DRC is one of the top ten crypto-friendly countries in Africa. 

The Congo Basin in DRC has one of the richest endowments of natural assets in the world, but current economic systems reward extraction over preservation.
