Discover GainForest, a non-profit dedicated to using AI and decentralized science for measuring and rewarding sustainable nature stewardship. Explore our platform at https://links.gainforest.earth. 🌐

GainForest is focused on building an open, transparent planetary computer to provide marginalized communities from the Global South with access to cutting-edge analysis and insights into their impact. 🌱

We believe in the potential of DeSci and AI to enable action at a significant scale to combat climate change and biodiversity loss, fostering a participatory community by developing open, free intelligence infrastructure, models, and data sources for AI algorithms. 🌎

Experience the synergy of ReFi and DeSci, as we reward local data collectors for their contributions. 📸 Our 'measure-to-earn' approach has seen success in the Philippines, where community members earned data income by taking pictures of mangroves. 💚

As a pioneering ReSci project, GainForest collaborates with academia and local communities, striving to build our solutions transparently with the community. We are supporting mangroves, rainforests and Indigenous communities in the Global South 🤝

Explore our Green Globe Hub at https://maps.gainforest.app and check out our Hugging Face demos at https://huggingface.co/gainforest. Together, let's contribute to a more sustainable and thriving world! 🌿
