# What is Praise?

Praise is an open-source community intelligence tool that has been designed to create a more engaging online environment. Community engagement is a critical factor in building a strong and sustainable community, and Praise has been developed to facilitate this.

Embracing a gratitude culture and gathering decentralized updates on what is happening is a key resource to keep the community informed and take action on the issues that matter. We are dedicated to providing data-driven insights that help communities make informed decisions and create positive change. Furthermore, the Praise system is user-generated data, trustworthy, and ungameable.

# How Praise benefits the ecosystem?

Use Praise for insights. Praise creates how communities function . Praise provides different types of data analysis and reports. We call it community intelligence.

**Use Praise to build reputation scores.** Praise provides a transparent and verifiable record of community contributions.Praise has a built-in feature that allows the creation of reputation scores which can be used to reward contributors for their efforts. In the future, reputation could be used as a governance tool, without financial power ensuring builders get to communicate ideas, since reputation can not be sold in the market. This feature is easy to use, even if you don't have any prior experience with Web3 technologies. We also support more advanced use cases, such as creating POAPs, NFTs or verifiable credentials that can be used to securely store and share information about an individual's qualifications, achievements, skills, and other attributes.

**Use Praise to reward contributors.** Contributors are rewarded based on actual contributions and impact. Praise allows contributors to reward peers for their participation and loyalty with tokens, points, badges, or other virtual rewards. Praise integrates with a variety of token distribution platforms. This system can help organizations create better user experiences, increase user engagement, and foster a more supportive community.

**Use Praise to build a culture of cooperation, giving and gratitude.** Praise is a powerful tool that can help build strong communities, foster cooperation, and mutual support among members. By allowing community members to easily give Praise to other peers for their contributions;a positive feedback loop is created that motivates people to continue performing well and contributing to the community.

**Praise → Learn → Score → Reward**

# Where we are at?

Praise has 1284 active praise givers from 13 active communities (DAO’s). These users have given a total of 34554 praises since the inception of the platform.

In addition to the 13 active communities currently using Praise, we also have a waiting list of over 20 communities who have expressed interest in integrating our platform. However, due to budget limitations, we have not been able to move as quickly as we would like to in onboarding these new communities.
