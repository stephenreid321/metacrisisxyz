#### A Third Attractor Candidate

Civol is a decentralized coordination platform based on asynchronous video communication. Massively scalable, Civol enables experts to discourse and debate the issues while community members vote their level of resonance on everything they say. 

**Civol Earth is a Civol instance dedicated to the Metacrisis.** Each existential threat — AI ALIGNMENT, BIOTECH, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, CLIMATE, etc. — is a separate multithreaded *discourse* on Civol Earth, with each thread having its own panel of experts. These expert panels are refreshed algorithmically over time to ensure all voices are heard. Civol discourses remain open and ongoing until consensus is reached, so discourse is occurring on all issues simultaneously. 

On Civol Earth, **top minds worldwide come together to make sense and propose solutions to every existential threat we face**, with the global audience feeding back on everything they say. Ambient voting, which is built into Civol's media consumption flow, allows us to measure consensus on specific statements, ideas, and proposals, as the narrative evolves over time. This will allow us to come to consensus on what we want to do about those existential threats, that is, to make collective decisions about them. 

Civol Earth was chosen as the Civol pilot because Civol is a coordination solution and there is no more important coordination problem than the Metacrisis. 

#### Technology

Civol intends to fully embody the spirit of web3. Built on the Internet Computer, the Civol MVP is now ready for first users. It runs entirely on chain, at web speed, is massively scalable, and will ultimately become fully autonomous, supporting an entire ecosystem through its CVL token.

#### Team

- Carl Carpenter — Founder, inventor of Asynchronous Video Conversation, responsible for Civol product and project management and design.

- Awaz Gyawali — Seven years of experience in software development across various industries, lead developer on Civol.

- Sandesh Gyawali — Electronics and communication engineer, Flutter, Svelte, responsible for frontend development..

- Hitesh Tripathi — Recent graduate of AKGEC GHZ India. Responsible for backend development using Motoko.

#### Funding

We're now raising a seed round to cover the project through Beta launch and CVL token distribution. We would very much like funding to come from the Metacrisis community, and all who understand that Moloch is actually the greatest threat to human existence.
