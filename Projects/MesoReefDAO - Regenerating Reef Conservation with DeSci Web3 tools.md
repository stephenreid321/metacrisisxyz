**What?**

Mesoamerican Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative that focuses on the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DeSci (Decentralized Science) that seeks to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR).
The Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.

MesoreefDAO Regenerating Framework Elements

**Mission** 
The MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.

**Vision**

The MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats, improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.

**Problem**

The problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.

However, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.

**How?**

MesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef System through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.

The framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System. 

The MesoReefDAO's early stage of development (January 2023) provides an opportunity for stakeholders to get involved and help shape the organization's future direction, collaboration, and coordination.

**In this proposal, we aim to further develop and expand the capabilities of MesoReefDAO through the Climate Solutions + DeSci category of the Gitcoin Grants program.**

Our proposed project includes:

1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.

2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.

3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.

4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will be used to automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.

**When?**

**2023: Q1-Q4**

**Q1-2023**

- Assemble transdisciplinary experts and core members for MesoReefDAO.

- Acquire an ENS domain and create a [safe.global](http://safe.global/) for funds.

- Create a Discord server.

- Promote the proposal on social media.

**Q2/Q3-2023**

-Create the framework for the MesoReefDAO [DeSci DAO](https://mirror.xyz/cryptobenthic%F0%9F%90%A0.eth/VPekPDF5fqOdbVPSwpRfqv0KimI_208fbTbq5eRGk_4): protocol, governance, incentives, organization, operations, and applications.

- Apply for both traditional and decentralized grants.

- Monitor project growth and promote it through social media, summits, forums, and academic conferences.

**Q4-2023**

- Identify specific conservation projects for the Mesoamerican Reef System to focus on for proposals to join the MesoReefDAO.

- Create a co-management plan for the coordination and operation of MesoReefDAO:

1. Establish a clear governance structure and decision-making process that involves all stakeholders.

2. Develop a shared vision and goals for the project, ensuring that they are aligned with the values and objectives of all involved parties.

3. Establish regular communication channels and meetings to facilitate ongoing collaboration and information sharing.

4. Identify and assign roles and responsibilities to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.

5. Develop a plan for monitoring and evaluating the project's progress, and adjust the plan as needed to ensure that it remains on track.

MesoReefDAO aims to collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders including scientists, the private sector, local communities, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government entities. Through these collaborations, MesoReefDAO aims to leverage the power of blockchain and DeSci DAOs to drive positive change to local communities and create synergies between sectors to address the challenges faced by coral reefs and the MAR. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, MesoReefDAO seeks to foster innovation and develop effective solutions for coral reef conservation and restoration.

MesoReefDAO is committed to promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our project, including collaboration. We believe that diversity in perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences leads to more innovative solutions and better outcomes. We actively seek out partnerships and collaborations with individuals and organizations that share our values and commitment to DEI.
