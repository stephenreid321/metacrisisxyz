Summary:

Raise funds to start an incubator for addressing the metacrisis

Description:

As an active participant in the metacrisis community, I have been hosting weekly syncs for folks to catch up with each other and ideate on solutions to solve the metacrsis. Based on my experience in DAOs and in the metacrisis community, I have seen that groups need to go through a cohort style process where they 

1. are introduced to the metacrisis
2. enlist their skills
3. find others with complimentary skills
4. get a crash course on web3 
5. spin up a project which addresses this crisis with a few folks in the cohort.

This is a common approach that many incubators use, and I think we'd need such an incubator to bootstrap some initial projects/DAOs

With the funds received from this QF round, I'd like to open up the opportunity to the rest of the metacrisis DAO and community to  join me in spinning up this incubator. I'll only serve as a coordinator/project manager for this initiative. With abundant talent in the metacrisis community and now backed by capital with QF, I am confident that we'd be able to create a V1 of such an incubator by the next round.

Funds will be coordinaped amongst participants who help build V1 between this round and the next QF round


About me:

I have been working in DAOs for two years, my expertise is in meta-governance where i offer my opinions and lead strategic initiatives in DAOs such as BanklessDAO, 1inch, VitaDAO etc...
