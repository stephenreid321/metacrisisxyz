"ReFi Medellín Join the movement towards a more sustainable and equitable future in Medellín, Colombia”

We are excited to announce the formation of a ReFi Local Node in Medellín, led by Juan Giraldo and Tereza Bizkova, to nurture community conversations around Web3 enabled regenerative-oriented-innovations (ROIs). Our aim is to empower the youth in Medellín to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.
We kindly ask for your support and donations to our grant, so we can start our journey of youth-led education for regeneration!
 
With a match funding pool of over $250k, thanks to the amazing Gitcoin community, every single dollar makes a big difference.


We intend to raise 53.000 USD that will be well spent to generate the following ambitious outcomes:

Engage the local community (4 per year):
Host four ReFi Medellín events over the next year. These events will include expert guest speakers in ReFi, Web3, and urban challenges in Latin American cities.
($1.500/event = $6.000)

ReFi Hackathons (5 per year). 
We hope to engage young people from different developers communities and different universities, and private sector organizations interested in Web3 and sustainability.
($2.500/Hackathon = $12.500)

Support Web3 and Regenerative Oriented Innovations (ROIs):
Incubate and invest in three social enterprises that come out of ReFi Medellín hackathons.
($5.000/Enterprise = $15.000)

Impact Onboarding (12 per year):
Create associations with active ecological groups and carry out 12 (one each month) through activities such as planting trees, cleaning environments, garbage collection, etc.
($1000/activity = $12.000)

Keep Medellín as Eternal Spring City (2 activities in the year):
Activity dedicated to plant flowers and help regenerate the flower insect in Medellín, helping this way to protect Medellín as a Eternal Spring City.
($1.500/Activity = $3.000)

Include ReFi in Dotlabs() workshops (3 per year):
Dotlabs() will host three meetups about ReFi and ecology in HashHouse.
($1.500/Activity = $4.500)


Outline of our team:
Hash House is the first club in the world where access is limited by the power of Blockchain Technology (NFTs). Their mission is to provide a space for blockchain lovers, programmers, entrepreneurs and investors to have conversations, listen to experts and strengthen their knowledge within the ecosystem. Act as a bridge between new technologies and the Colombian entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Hash has been witnessing how blockchain technology is changing the world, and how Medellin is transforming into the Crypto Valley of Latin America. During this first year, they have achieved together: +50 Monday Meetups, +65 educational talks, 4 pitch days, +1,500 visitors during Cosmoverse '22, +1,200 visitors during ETH Medellin '22, +10 Corporate events, +5 Product launches, +15 artists and djs, +5 art exhibitions and thousands of connections...
