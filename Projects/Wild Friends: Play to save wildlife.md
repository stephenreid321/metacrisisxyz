# Summary

We are creating a platform for wildlife sanctuaries around the world to adopt Web3 technology to receive donations. Supporting animals through NFTs will give you access to a video game to interact with digital versions of the animals, customise their environments and visit those of your friends, as well as view cameras from inside the sanctuaries. There will be several different NFTs of each animal, made by volunteers and artists who have interacted with them IRL. 


# Intro

A game/metaverse of wildlife sanctuaries to support them through digital collectibles (NFTs) of the animals living in the shelter. These digital collectibles will be used to customise the virtual animal’s environment and get access to the cameras inside the wildlife sanctuary. The pilot for this project is Senda Verde, an exotic animal shelter in Bolivia.

Learn more about the shelter's history on the website.


## Vision

Guided by the purpose of creating a healthier planet, our vision is a world richer in nature where wildlife thrives. We have seen a tremendous opportunity to expand the animal refuge model with web3, thanks to recent advances in regenerative finance and support for public goods.

Among the opportunities that web3 brings, we have identified 3 relevant uses for Senda Verde that can be expanded to other refuges:

Open source allows this model to be replicable to more animal shelters and to create a network of mutually supporting shelters
NFTs and SBTs (Soulbound tokens) to reward volunteers, artists and donors who support Senda Verde.
A video game to connect with wildlife sanctuaries without the need to physically visit them.


## How it works

Volunteers, artists and the Senda Verde team stand out for their ability to create art inspired by the experience of visiting the sanctuary and sharing with the animals, listening to their stories and transmitting them to the world.

These works of art (painting, photography, video, drawing or even music) thanks to web3 have a lot of potential to generate an income that will help to give sustainability to Senda Verde. So we will use them to create digital collectibles (in the form of NFTs) that not only generate revenue, but also social awareness, entertainment, engagement and a sense of community.

We are creating an engaging and interactive way to motivate the purchase and use of these digital collectibles. The form is a video game where collectors can visit different animal shelters via cameras, interact with digital versions of the animals, collect artwork of the animals and visit those of their friends. The “book of collectibles” will function as a "Green Passport" to show your friends the different refuges you supported, the art of the animals and even access the cameras of the animal you are supporting.



## Plan

The preliminary phase of the videogame has been completed. The project became the fourth most supported in Devcon Bogota’s Quadratic Funding round and already has a partnership with Senda Verde for the pilot. The studio that will support our game developer is currently being decided. For this proposal, we plan to launch the project MVP to start building a community and bring early supporters who will help us shape the project.




## Team

Product and Strategy: Nico Gallardo is a creative and resourceful entrepreneur and innovator. He will take the lead in the partnership with Nouns Amigos to expand the vision of this first pilot. In the general project he is contributing to the strategy and product development. Leveraging his web3 knowledge, skills and network, he will bring together the relevant parties to give life to this project.

Game design and development: Rafa Gallardo is a videogame expert, 3d artist and game designer who is taking on the challenge to develop an MVP of this vision. 

Mirna Teran Bolivian marketer and NFT artist: She started supporting Senda Verde with the use of this technology through digital art and community building in the web3 world. With her experience she will help create the community around SendaVerde NFT expanding the circle of potential collectors and collaborators positioning the project as the first Bolivian wildlife green chip project.


### The Senda Verde team:

Vicky Ossio leads the hands-on work and oversees the day-to-day operations of SV. She is also an active member of The Life Raft Group, a non-profit organisation dedicated to cancer research, fundraising and patient care.

Marcelo Levy coordinates animal welfare procedures and cares for the baby monkeys that need constant supervision and companionship to survive. Prior to founding SV, Marcelo was a field coordinator for an international aid project contractor, overseeing a range of projects including ecotourism planning, sourcing alternative resources and advising farmers on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. He continues to mentor local people and nearby communities.

Mauricio Acosta, with a background in fund management for social impact institutions and project structuring, will provide his experience and knowledge to give sustainability to the project in terms of structure and management of both human and financial resources.
