# **ReFi Paramaribo: A regenerative community hub in a net-negative carbon nation**

ReFi Paramaribo is proud to participate in the Local Node Prize by ReFi DAO and Commons Stack. Our mission is to empower local individuals and organizations to come together and create a more sustainable and equitable future by providing a co-working space, resources, education, and networking opportunities for local innovation actors. 

**Catalyze a regenerative future in Suriname** ðŸŒ± **Become a contributor for ReFi Paramaribo today!**

As Suriname's economy has been spiraling downwards for years, and traditional financial systems have failed to address the root causes of this issue. We believe that a regenerative finance approach, which prioritizes creating positive social impact and environmental outcomes, can help to address these challenges and generate more resilient opportunities in Suriname.

ReFi Paramaribo connects local change makers and innovators to a network of like-minded individuals, resources, and opportunities to turn ideas into reality, for a more sustainable and positive future for Suriname.

Our initial funding goal is USD 10,000, which will be used to cover the costs of hosting networking events, providing educational resources, offering support for local innovative projects, and providing a co-working space equipped with all necessary amenities for our members. Any additional funds will be used to expand our reach and impact through marketing and outreach efforts.

Our success will be measured by the number of individuals and organizations that are able to access resources and support through our network, as well as the impact of the projects and initiatives that we support.

Our team consists of:
