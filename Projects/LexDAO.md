## about LexDAO

LexDAO is a longstanding 'metaguild' member of the web3 community. 

We are the schelling point for 'codeslaw' public goods & services. We are a 501c6 business association for legal engineers and affiliated professionals.

Our OSS projects include:

* [LexDAO](https://github.com/lexdao)

* [KaliDAO](https://github.com/kalidao)

But our GitHub is hardly the full picture. (Our members don't always push to our organization's GitHub anyway, given we're a pro-autonomy business association.) 

Some of our most important contributions to OSS is at the open law, model law layers, as well as other areas that require blockchain-code-deference legalese such as DAO or network state law. 

In other words, we are a community that makes the kinds of licenses used to open-source software and affiliated IP. Without these kinds of licenses, IP couldn't be open sourced. See the templates provided by projects such as [wrapper](https://wrappr.wtf).

Updates about our growing community of codeslaw OSS contributors [at our Substack](https://lexdao.substack.com).

Codeslaw is a meme of the "code is law" & "work in public" web3 virtues, integrated with the 'code deference' legal philosophy pioneered by LeXpunK army and refined by LexDAO contributors. 

If we think of Solidity "smart contracts" as codeslaw initially invented by legal engineer Nick Szabo, then it's apparent that codeslaw is one of the most important forms of OSS in web3. 

Based on the roots of why Ethereum was created in the first place, [codeslaw is for the 'unlawed' what Proof of Work is for the 'unbanked'](https://distributed-autonomous-society.quora.com/The-Unlawed). 

Most of our members are cryptolawyers and legal engineers, but that's not a requirement. All codeslaw fans are welcome!

As a DAO, we fund a variety of internal & external projects that span the multidisciplinary requirements of codeslaw public goods & services. 

LexDAO does a lot of codeslaw pro bono work, ensuring the funds we have get the job done regardless. Sometimes codeslaw is more important than money!

All donations to this Gitcoin Round will be used by our DAO to directly pay for OSS codeslaw development. Additionally, we always prioritize positive impact DAO and projects that offer valuable practical-web3-experience student education opportunities. 

If you'd like to get involved in LexDAO governance, membership is open to everyone! Please visit [LexDAO's Discord](http://lexdao.chat) to join our community and [subscribe to our newsletter](https://lexdao.substack.com).

Support codeslaw by [proudly wearing this designer hat](https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/codeslaw-hat) (currently unavailable)!
