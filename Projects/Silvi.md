Silvi is contributing to the trillion tree target by building financial and coordination tools for hyperlocal reforestation.
 
We believe the bulk of the solution is twofold:
 
💰⏳ **TreeForwards** - tree funding i.e tree-commitments to incentivize and reward performance-based tree stewardship

📍🔭 **Extreme traceability** and attribution of new trees, not just for accountability and inventorying, but to unleash the community effects needed for tree-planting to become a thing!
 
Let's unpack that 👆
 
**Tree Forwards:**
Silvi is collateralizing the net present value of New Trees. Further, tree investments are low risk instruments because they are performance-based payouts depended on verifyable milestones.

Tree forwards define the unit economics of reforestation but because there are 50-60k tree species, tree forward claims are themselves tied to species-specific methodologies. For this Silvi is supporting a p2p library of species-specific methodologies. Think of it as tree wikis for tree science  and a participatory model for the ground work/truth 👇
 
**Ground truth and MRV:**
Our focus has been on building a stack to serve the human-centric stages of the tree lifecycle while setting a strong and reliable foundation from which other Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) can happen. V1 of our app incorporated the registering of trees and saplings. For v2 of the app which is being launched next month, we have completed IPFS, Tree data NFTs, claim settlement payout contracts and started work on methodology smart contracts.
 
Interface:
Silvi is building an app where we're leveraging social media mechanics with citizen science frameworks to develop a Pokemon-Go-like experience for gamified tree planting and stewardship ![](https://i.imgur.com/4P7RVc3.jpg)

 
Further, We're collaborating with dMeter Orgs such as Athena, Ecolabs and Regen Network on a Filecoin grant to deliver Claim Resolution for reforestation claims. Further, we'd like to collaborate and interop with other projects and technologies on techniques for statistical sampling of ground truth as well as remote sensing inference. And ultimately, we'd like to vertically integrate with carbon-certifying projects. 
 
**Tokenomics:**
Our long term plans involve launching a native governance token issued through tree commitments. Governance tokens will spawn utility NFT pairs that contain all the data and contracts for each tree.

**Pilots:**
To date, Silvi has already deployed several pilots in the United States, including planting of 5 hardwood species and pines in a retired golf course while partnering with a conscious festival called Fire Flies Forest and experimenting with sapling distribution to homes and neighborhoods in Florida. Additionally, Silvi is partnering with EcoLabs and AgroforestDAO on the development of an adaptive agroforestry methodology leveraging Silvi's MRV and Tree Forwards.

Silvi's biggest focus is currently in Kenya, where it is connecting communities such as schools and small holder farmers to Kenya's last rainforest, Kakamega forest. Silvi is building a methodology to help establish small, distributed nursery beds around the forest with the goal of improving supply of saplings. With the help of Gitcoin funding, Silvi has established operations in a dozen schools and 20+ small holder farmers and approaching 100k trees propagated from seed. The project is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries, Silvi is helping expand capacity of reforestation via its theory of change that a greater number of independent nurseries run by community members via a participatory model will help increase capacity and coordination. Silvi is close to being assigned an exclusive area for planting and forest management where our MRV and methodology will be put to the test over the following years. ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0nniCy.png)

Partners:
We're so happy to be part of dMeter where other awesome dMRV projects like EcoLabs, Athena, Avano Ogallala and Orgo are working together to solve planetary restoration and natural capital creation! We're partnering with Ecolabs and AgroForestDAO on the development of an agroforestry methodology. With recently won first prize for OpenTrees, a structured tree data submission we applied with Ecolabs and FarmOS to Filecoin's Sustainable Blockcahin hackathon. We're also proud to be supported by Celo and the Climate Collective and incorporating Celo's stables for payouts in Kenya
