**Do you want to take part in re-storing, re-newing, and re-pairing all that is needed to re-establish healthy relationships among all beings in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Join us by in-vesting 2.5% of whatever you can in the 2.5% of the Earth's biodiversity that lives in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica.**

**Imagine... a regenerative Osa community**
The Osa Peninsula is one of the climax ecosystems in the world that holds 2.5% of the Earth's biodiversity on only 1/1000 of her land mass. Imagine the wisdom and seeds it holds for people and other places in the world to be regenerated. Imagine that the community here lives in harmony with each other and the greater-than-human world and has economic/ value systems that allow all beings to evolve from surviving to thriving. 

**The invitation**
The ReGenerOsa Collective invites you to **invest 2.5% of whatever you can in the 2.5% of the Earth's biodiversity** by providing unrestricted funding to community weavers, place-based stewards of grassroots projects,  and the implementation of processes that are necessary for true cohesion. 
*Financially this could entail:* 
- 2.5% of the cost of a vacation,  
- 2.5% of your gross profits, 
- 2.5% of profits from your album/concert/book, 
- $25, 250, 2.5 million dollars/colones, 
- and whatever you can think of!

*More than financial capital*
Furthermore, we have systems in place that allow you to in-vest more than financial capital, such as materials, time, expertise, etc... In this way, we aim to match the overflow of one capital from a member in the collective with the need of another member.  Furthering a more equitable and solidary economic system that promotes connection with the greater-than-human world that we are all part of.

**Fund distribution**
The funds are distributed through participatory, prosocial processes that invite and empower stewards, weavers, investors, and ambassadors to engage in collective decision-making. Joining us in the journey of expanding our capacities to co-laborate and take action with each other in the most regenerative ways we can imagine.

***Are you ready to in-vest in the most beautiful future all our hearts know is possible for one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Join us now!***

**Portfolio Examples**
*Osa Weaver- Dona Eida Fletes*
Eida Fletes embodies the dweller of a Blue Zone, someone who has lived through great challenges and brings lightness and humor, guidance, and wisdom to everything she does. Similar to many campesinos in this area - she supports herself and her family through a variety of economic activities such as creating and selling culinary herbs and spices, rural tourism on her farm Jarcana, and tours and workshops about two of her passions, taxonomy, and mushrooms. 

Beyond her economic activities, Eida is a natural community weaver and leader - active in the local Catholic Church, council and mentor to numerous people and groups, and a long-time activist for the rights of the natural world and the local campesino population. 

As someone born on land that is now part of Corcovado National Park, Eida is a skilled storyteller and history bearer for this part of the Peninsula

*Osa Stewards - Manos Cambiadas*
Manos Cambiadas is a project founded on the long-standing tradition of the community helping the community. Every 7 days a group of volunteers organized by Los Higuerones and ASCONA both local and community-oriented organizations, go to a farm to help producers with different tasks. The main focus is to support local producers in improving their agricultural practices into more healthy and ecological ways for themselves and for their lands, supporting the food sovereignty of the area and the access to healthier products for the population of Puerto Jimenez.
