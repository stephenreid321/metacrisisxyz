Hi, I'm Stephen Reid. I have a passion for connecting people, projects and ideas around the metacrisis, which I've been doing for a few years now.

I'm what Gary Sheng would call an ["In-Betweener"](https://substack.garysheng.com/p/inbetweeners), a "public servant who doesn't fit neatly within a single organization—a compassionate super-connector who fills the gaps in-between". And as he writes in that article, despite "efficiently driving public good outcomes", In-Betweeners are "chronically undervalued and underfunded".

This is your chance to show not just your appreciation for my work as a metacrisis network weaver, but to demonstrate the web3 & metacrisis communities recognise and value the work of in-betweeners more generally.

Some of my recent outputs include:

* [The Obsidian-powered, AI-enhanced wiki for metacrisis.xyz](https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/)
* [My knowledgraph](https://stephenreid.net/knowledgegraph), featuring a linked, searchable graph of hundreds of metacrisis-related resources
* [Knowledgraphs I've produced for other metacrisis thinkers](https://stephenreid.net/k), including Alnoor Ladha, Jim Rutt, Nate Hagens, Jordan Hall, Sophie Strand, Jamie Wheal, Bayo Akomolafe and Nora Bateson
* Curated lists of [books](https://stephenreid.net/books) and [podcasts](https://stephenreid.net/podcasts) related to the metacrisis
* The [Futurecraft Residency](https://dandelion.earth/e/futurecraft-residency), a week-long facilitated residency on cultivating wholeness & crafting regenerative futures inspired by the work of Daniel Schmachtenberger and other metacrisis thinkers
* Ongoing development of the [Dandelion](https://dandelion.earth/) platform for regenerative events and co-created gatherings
* My free monthly newsletter, [*Stephen Reid In Correspondence*](https://stephenreid.substack.com/)

Previously, I founded [The Psychedelic Society](https://psychedelicsociety.org.uk/), taught the [Life as Practice](https://stephenreid.net/life-as-practice), [How to DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxbb3YkrjAT1TUe6W2yCFUAsXUhdVt5JYoJwmMfykoQ/edit), [Tools for the Regenerative Renaissance](https://dandelion.earth/events/5fd23eae6824a9000d43006e), [The Promise of Decentralisation](https://dandelion.earth/events/605f1caeed084e000d44e844) & [Introduction to web3](https://dandelion.earth/events/623c3fccf9cf930011212aa1) courses, served as the youngest ever board member of [Greenpeace UK](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/), and consulted for organisations including the [New Economics Foundation](https://neweconomics.org/), the [Living Wage Foundation](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/) and [350.org](https://350.org/). I have an MPhys in [Physics](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/) from the University of Oxford, an MRes in [Complexity Science](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bccs/) from the University of Bristol, and I'm currently studying for the UC Berkeley [Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://em-executive.berkeley.edu/professional-certificate-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence/).

Your support is much appreciated and will encourage me to continue the weaving in the months ahead 🧙‍♂️ 🙏
