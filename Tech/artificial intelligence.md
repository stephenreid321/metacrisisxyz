Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to create intelligent machines capable of perceiving, learning, and making decisions. It combines elements of philosophy, computer science, neuroscience, engineering, economics, and game theory to create sets of algorithms that mimic mental, cognitive, and physical abilities found in humans. AI technologies are applied to problem-solving tasks, particularly in extracting knowledge from large data sets and identifying patterns and trends. AI techniques can also be used to automate decision-making, reduce human intervention in processes, and create more efficient algorithms for solving complex problems quickly and cost-effectively.
