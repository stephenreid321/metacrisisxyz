Permaculture is a design methodology rooted in ecological principles and an ethos of stewardship and restoration of natural environments. It applies principles, practices, and insights derived from the design of living systems for the creation of sustainable societies in balance with the environment. This approach is based on observing natural patterns and ecosystems and incorporating elements from them into the design of the built environment. Permaculture designs create productive and resilient agroecological systems, reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources, and build soil fertility and water resources. With permaculture, we are designing our future story to live in harmony with nature and all its inhabitants.
