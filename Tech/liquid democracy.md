Liquid democracy is a form of democratic participation that enables citizens to assign their votes to trusted individuals or organizations, or delegates, who will then cast these votes on the citizens’ behalf. This type of democracy seeks to increase individual engagement, by harnessing both the collective wisdom of the public-at-large and the specialized knowledge of individuals and organizations. The delegates are chosen by those whom they will represent narrowly or broadly, depending on the context, to ensure the most informed and effective votes. In this way, liquid democracy aims to improve upon traditional methods of democratic governance by ensuring effectiveness through participation and specialization.
