Complexity Science is the interdisciplinary study of complex adaptive systems, exploring how to effectively navigate the phenomenon of emergence and navigate the chaotic dynamics of organized and nonlinear behavior in systems that consist of multiple, diversely interacting parts of varying scales and locations. By better understanding the dynamics of complexity, complexity science actively seeks to use this knowledge to develop novel ways to identify patterns, manage complexity, drive innovation, and design highly adaptive and responsive systems.
