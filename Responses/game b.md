Game B is an approach to social and economic systems design that seeks to create an environment that rewards cooperation, systemic health, and resiliency. It puts a premium on creating environments and game dynamics that incentivize behaviors, pathways, and resources that lead to broadly beneficial outcomes. Rather than competing for a finite number of resources, Game B encourages the creation of an abundant and generative social framework that serves the whole. It views cooperative dynamics as fundamental, and uses principles and methods of design to create positive-sum, mutually beneficial systems.
