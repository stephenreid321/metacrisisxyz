A thought experiment is an abstract, hypothetical exercise used by philosophers, scientists and other thinkers in order to explore an idea or concept. By working through a thought experiment, the individual engages with a concept in the absence of any experimentally or empirically verifiable data. By doing this, they are able to assess its implications and potential outcomes, while also allowing greater insight into theoretical problems and solutions. Thought experiments can lead to visualizing previously unexplored or unpractised solutions and can provide innovative problem-solving techniques. Ultimately, through the process of a thought experiment, one can gain greater insight into the idea or concept being explored.
