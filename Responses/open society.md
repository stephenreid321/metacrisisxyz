An open society is a social arrangement characterized by substantial freedom of expression, a broad array of competing values, and the ability to democratically challenge existing norms and institutions. An open society seeks to maximize the chances of success of its constituent members by allowing them to determine their individual aspirations and evaluate opposing viewpoints. This process of questioning established beliefs and standards helps people to develop greater understanding of their social environment, and better inform them as to make well-informed decisions on how to act. An open society thereby provides individuals with an opportunity to participate in the development of their culture, and to promote open communication and cooperation among its citizens.
