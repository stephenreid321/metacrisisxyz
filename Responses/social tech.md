Social Tech can be thought of as a term encompassing tools, methods, and practices that aim to increase the collective capacity to be leveraged for better outcomes, precisely defined according to the context and goals of a given social system. Building from the recognition that virtually all societal issues are structural, systemic, and relational in nature, Social Tech thus focuses on leveraging the interdependence, power dynamics, and institutional patterns that drive collective performance. Consequently, it involves a combination of approaches, from cross-sector collaboration and collective intelligence, to technology-enabled and data-driven systems-change.
