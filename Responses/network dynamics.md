Network dynamics is a field of study that focuses on the interrelated and interconnected behavior of components, agents, and structures within larger systems. It explores how components interact and adapt to their environment, the emergence of collective behavior, and how feedback loops form pathways for the evolution of complex system structures. It has implications for biological, physical, social, economic, and organizational studies and provides an essential framework for assessing systemic fragility, adaptability and resilience.
