Participatory governance is the recognition of the interdependent relationships between different stakeholders, who work together through direct participation and active engagement to create systems for collective decision-making. It is a form of self-organizing and collective action, where stakeholders collaborate to create shared solutions for societal problems, taking into account the complex dynamics of the social, political, and economic environment. It emphasizes democratic participation, which in turn bolsters good governance and strengthens resilience to external shocks.
