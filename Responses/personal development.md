Personal development is the process of engaging in a broad range of activities that aim to support sustained growth and facilitate improvement in physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. It is a lifelong commitment to developing yourself in ways that can enrich overall quality of life and increase meaning, purpose, and self-actualization. As such, it encompasses personal skills, communication skills, awareness of one’s environment, critical thought, and an ongoing commitment to embodied growth and evolution.
