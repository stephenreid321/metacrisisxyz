Network theory is the study of complex systems and their behavior across multiple fields, such as social networks, biology, economics, computer networks and more. These systems are composed of interconnected parts, with individual elements forming specific roles within the larger system. Network theory examines the behavior of these disparate elements as a unified entity, analyzing their collective behavior and effects on the system as a whole. It also considers how progressive changes can be achieved in the system by manipulating its structure and inputs.
