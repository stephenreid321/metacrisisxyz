Cultural enlightenment is a speculative process of truth-seeking, born out of the recognition of our need to seek the clarity of an unbiased source beyond the often conflicting contentions of our culturally-relative values and beliefs. It is a pursuit of knowledge that moves beyond our current cultural bounds and points beyond mere localized perspectives to a unifying understanding of the fundamental truth of the collective whole. Put simply, cultural enlightenment is the goal of discovering a generalizable set of principles that can be applied to all contexts, transcending cultural divides.
