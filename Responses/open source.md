Open source refers to the practice of software development in which the source code for the production of a specific application or system is made publicly available. Open source software allows for the collaborative creation of intellectual works, allowing many stakeholders to participate and contribute to a particular project. In doing so, it provides multiple benefits such as reducing the duplication of efforts, resulting in a better quality of code, higher standards, and faster progress - all while promoting transparency, collaboration, and open sharing of knowledge.
