Emergent order is a phenomenon in which complex, dynamic, interconnected systems composed of many individual actors transitioning between multiple states result in outcomes that are greater than the sum of their parts. This occurs when individuals interacting freely and naturally without predetermined outcomes create macro-level patterns that existing theory or rule sets cannot predict. These macro-level patterns emerge through a synergy of the individual actions, contingencies, and environmental factors that shape each individual's decision-making and behavior. This makes emergent order a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of complex, interdependent systems.
