A closed loop is a system of processes where the output of one process becomes the input for the next process, producing a feedback loop that is continually reinforced and makes the system self-sustaining. As such, the closed loop concept is useful for understanding the dynamic behaviours of complex systems, as well as for designing strategies and tactics to optimize their performance. In this regard, the closed loop is related to the concepts of resilience and systems thinking, in which the effects of any change must be considered in the context of the entire system and all its interacting parts.
