Public education is the provision of publicly funded or publicly sponsored educational services and resources to members of society in order to increase their knowledge base, improve their skills, foster their growth and development, enhance their sense of autonomy and agency, and maximize their potential for success in life. It is rooted in the recognition of education as a fundamental human right, with each person having access to educational opportunities in order to develop both individual and collective civic engagement and democratic participation. As such, public education privileges equity and inclusion, encourages creative thinking and problem solving, equips individuals with the tools to contribute to society and lead fulfilling lives, and works to promote the maximization of human potential.
