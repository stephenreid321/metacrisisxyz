A ‘value system’ is the myriad of beliefs, attitudes, and cultural norms which a person or organization uses to evaluate themselves, others, and the environment. It encompasses our ideas about what qualities are important, what activities and relationships are meaningful, and our overall approaches to life. It serves to both inform and constrain our individual and collective behaviors - providing direction, structure and a basis for making decisions in an ever-evolving context. It is something we continually learn and refine as we grow and evolve, and as our understanding of the world expands.
